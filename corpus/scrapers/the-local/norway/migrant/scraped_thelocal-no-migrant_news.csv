					08:14 CET+01:00				",AFP,Knausgård: anti-migrant party 'a blessing' ,"Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgård has described the anti-immigrant Progress Party as a “blessing” for Norwegian politics, as societies must “dare to talk about the problematic aspects of immigration”.
The writer, whose 3,500 page novel My Struggle was a sensation in Norway when its six books were published between 2009 and 2011, has been increasingly vocal about what he sees as the refusal of the educated middle classes in his adopted home of Sweden to face up to the realities of immigration.
“In Sweden, my impression is that the desire to be decent, which is in itself laudable, has given people an aversion anxiety against discussing many problems concerning integration and immigration,” he told Aftenposten during a book tour. “If you talk about the issues, it means you are somehow automatically critical of immigration.”
Swedish writer Jan Guillou, speaking on Norway's state broadcaster NRK on Thursday night dismissed Knausgård's attack on Sweden, saying he was a victim of the right-wing's “delusion” that immigration could not be discussed in the country.
“Knausgård is probably one of the worst political analysts in Scandinavia,” he told NRK on Thursday night. “God! Open debate? Over the last ten years this has been one of the main topics for discussion in Sweden. It surprises me that a man like Knausgård, who has lived in Sweden, is also a victim of this delusion.”
Knausgård said that the consequences of immigration depended on how much effort society was prepared to expend on the process.
“We know nothing about the consequences of immigration, but they are clearly entirely dependent on the resources used,” he said. “The worst thing that can happen is ghettos, closed cultures developing inside the culture.”
He said that in Stockholm at least, this had already happened.
“Stockholm is a divided city. The white middle and upper classes congregate in the urban areas, while the immigrants and working classes live in the suburbs,” he said. “That same white middle class is in favour of immigration, but they have no immigrants whatsoever close to them in their personal lives, and they become furious if anyone expresses right-wing populist views.”
However Knausgård stressed that while he thought it was good that Norway had a mainstream party which could express anxieties about immigration, he was not himself a Progress supporter.
“I do not agree with their views, but it is good that they are able to express them openly without being demonised,” he said."

					14:24 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Migrant numbers plunge as Norway now 'less attractive',"Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug says her moves to make Norway a less sought-after destination for migrants have worked.
According to Listhaug, an increasing number of migrants have dropped the idea of seeking asylum in Norway – exactly as she hoped.
“When I ask them [migrants she spoke with in Greece and Italy, ed.] about their opinions of Norway, they say that Norway has become strict and less attractive and not a country that they want to travel to,” she told VG.
The numbers seem to back up the claim. In May, just 195 asylum seekers came to Norway, the lowest May figure in 19 years.
Listhaug said that Norway’s political signals have been heard loud and clear.
“Everything that happens here at home, gets noticed. Many people want to travel to Germany, but noticeably fewer people want to come to Norway. It is important to be clear about our restrictions because this is a market driven by smugglers,” Listhaug said.
Only 1,407 asylum seekers have been registered through May, but Listhaug said it is hard to predict what might happen as the year goes on.
“The agreement between Turkey and Greece is working now, but how it will work in the future is uncertain. There is also uncertainty on what is going on with the traffic over the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy,” she said.
The Norwegian parliament is in the final stages of negotiating an immigration and asylum overhaul championed by Listhaug, who represents the anti-immigration Progress Party.
The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) said in January that it expects 60,000 asylum seekers in 2016, but the agency is expected to officially lower that forecast later this month."

""We consider that the Norwegian procedure ... is cause for concern,"" the UNHCR's representative in the Nordic region, Pia Prytz Phiri, told reporters at the close of a three-day visit.
""It's a problem for us that Norway considers Russia a safe asylum country,"" she said.
Norway decided in November that migrants who arrived in the Scandinavian country after having stayed legally in Russia had to be swiftly sent back to Russia -- without having their asylum applications considered -- since Oslo considered Russia a safe country.
Some 5,500 migrants arrived in Norway via the ""Arctic route"" through Russia last year.
After sending some 200 people back, Norway stopped returning migrants to Russia at Moscow's request, as Russian authorities cited ""security reasons"".
But Norway has said it is negotiating a resumption with Moscow.
The Norwegian return policy risks depriving some legitimate asylum seekers of their right to protection, the UNHCR warned.
An independent body within the Norwegian immigration authority, Landinfo, said it had been informed by the UN agency that Russia had in January 2015 expelled two Syrians back to their war-torn country.
Norwegian Immigration and Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug, speaking at the same press conference as Phiri Wednesday, assured that ""we are of course going to listen to what the UN has to say"".
She added however that ""there are situations where the UN recommendations go beyond what our commitments are in respect to international conventions"".
The UNHCR also said it was ""deeply concerned"" by Norway's plans to tighten rules for family reunifications.
The right-wing coalition government, which includes an anti-immigration party, has proposed that a person must have studied or worked for at least four years before being allowed to bring over their family.
The proposal, which is still in the early stages, would require parliament's green light and the government does not hold a majority."

Mission leader Pål Erik Teigen told NTB he's “never experienced a similar rescue”.
“We were to transfer 1,000 migrants from a tanker over to Siem Pilot when suddenly several rubber boats appeared. It seemed completely hopeless,” Teigen said.
When the Norwegian ship, which was full of migrants, began to sail away, some 25 people jumped into the sea and swam after the boat in an attempt to come on board.
“They were given life jackets and lifeboats boats quickly picked up those who were in the water. There was no one who drowned,” Teigen said.
The Norwegian ship was on Sunday night en route to Palermo with 1,093 migrants on board. Seven people were evacuated for health reasons, and the ship has 17 dead people on board, Siem Pilot said in a statement.
‘Chaos'
With the Siem Pilot over capacity, additional lifeboats were used to transfer migrants from their rubber boats to other civilian vessels.
Intelligence Officer Jan Erik Valen, who led the operation's security detail, said there was a sense of panic amongst the migrants.
“There was chaos on board the tanker. They pushed us towards the end of the boat from all directions, and fought over life jackets. Police forces from Siem Pilot helped us with shields. We beat sticks on tubes to make as much sound as possible and we ended up having to hit some of them,” he said.
Birth on board
On Sunday morning there was also a birth aboard Siem Pilot. The migrant mother and her newborn child were immediately evacuated to the Italian island of Lampedusa for further care.
“It has been chaotic at sea with very many migrant boats. The crew of Siem Pilot has worked intensely - and we are very satisfied with the work we have managed to accomplish in recent days,” Teigen said.
The Siem Pilot is part of the extensive rescue efforts in the Mediterranean and is tasked with the mission of saving desperate migrants trying to reach Europe. During the weekend rescue, the ship also had to deal with human smugglers.
“There was a boat that was very aggressive all night. We used the ship's spotlight to scare it away, but they were determined to try to retrieve the boats we had rescued the migrants from,” says Teigen.
Italy's interior ministry said Friday that more than 146,000 migrants have arrived in the country so far this year."

Mazyar Keshvari, immigration policy spokesman for the anti-immigration Progress Party, told the VG newspaper that he believed Norway should follow Switzerland's example. ""Norway should also have a referendum on immigration,"" he said. ""I am quite sure that there is majority support for tightening immigration across Norway's political parties. The polls show that."" On Sunday, the Swiss voted with a razor-thin 50.3 percent majority to limit immigration by drawing up immigration quotas, surprising the country's establishment. The decision has provoked calls for similar quotas from far-right parties elsewhere in Europe, with Germany's anti-EU party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and France's National Front both calling for new Swiss-inspired immigration laws. Norway is the first country where a government party has backed the Swiss decision, however. Progress's position clashed with that of Norway's Conservative Party, which leads the ruling two-party coalition. Europe Minister Vidar Helgesen stressed that her party supported open labour markets. ""We in Norway want to emphasize that the principle of free movement of people is essential for growth and prosperity in an open economy,"" she said after the Swiss result. Switzerland and Norway are both members of the European Economic Area (EEA), rather than the European Union, so any new immigration law Switzerland successfully negotiates within the EEA treaty could in theory be adopted by Norway. ""Progress has said many times that Norway should study the EEA Agreement and use whatever room for manoeuvre there is to limit immigration,"" Keshvari said. He accused Lithuanians and Poles of being drawn to Norway by the country's free health care and generous social security benefits. He said the party had yet to decide on what kinds of limits to immigration it would impose. ""We have not taken a position on quotas, either in the Progress programme or in government policy,"" he said. ""But it [immigration policy] will tighten up as soon as negotiations with the Liberals and Christian Democrats are finished."""

					10:14 CET+01:00				",NTB/The Local,Norway and Russia still at odds over migrant returns,"A week after Russia shut its Arctic border post with Norway for “security reasons”, the two nations have yet to agree on what should be done with asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected by Norway.
Norway temporarily halted its return of migrants -- mainly from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq -- who had entered from Russia on January 23rd following a request from Moscow.
Some 5,500 migrants crossed from Russia into Norway last year, on the last leg of an arduous journey through the Arctic to Europe. But the right-wing government in Oslo has decided that migrants who had been living legally in Russia, or had entered Russia legally, should be immediately returned there, on the basis that Russia is a safe country.

Officials from both nations will now meet on Wednesday to try to find a solution to the currently gridlocked situation.
The two sides will try to find agreement on which asylum seekers can be sent back to Russia. Moscow has said that it will not take any asylum seekers who crossed into Norway on non-returnable visas, while Oslo argues that the Russians are obligated to take them back under a 2008 bilateral agreement.
Arlid Moe, a senior researcher and Russia expert at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, said that the Norwegian government was probably too optimistic in its assessment that the Russians would take back the rejected asylum seekers.
“They [the Norwegian authorities, ed.] may have had a legitimate believe that everything was fine since the returns went smoothly before Christmas,” he told NTB.
Moe said that an internal Russian decision likely led to Moscow's change in course.
“We are so self-centred in Norway and are so inclined to believe that it is what we do – or don't do – that is essential, but I think it is more likely that the Russians have had internal discussions that ended with a new assessment,” he added.
Moe said that a key element in the two sides finding a solution will be whether Russia will commit to stopping foreigners without a Schengen visa before they pass the Russian border and continue on to Norway's Storskog border crossing, where they can seek asylum.
“My understanding of the Russian border regime is that Russians without Schengen visas have been stopped well before the Storskog border while foreigners have been allowed to pass, but there had been so few of these up until last autumn. When so many other asylum seekers discovered this route, the news travelled quickly and resulted in a large influx. I don't think this development was in any way caused by something the Russians did,” Moe added.
According to NTB, Wednesday's meeting will also address reports that a former diplomat in the Russian Foreign Ministry is behind five different companies that issued false work permits to around 1,000 Syrians.
“It is natural to get further information on what the Russian authorities knew about this,” Norwegian Foreign Ministry official Tore Hattrem told NTB."

""You are welcome to hate us, but hate us for the right reasons,"" the party's deputy leader Ketil Solvik-Olsen said at a press conference called on Tuesday to convince foreign correspondents that the party is not anti-immigration, anti-foreigner or anti-Islamic. But Tony Paterson from the UK's Independent newspaper, whose election report has been criticised by the party for accentuating its links to far-Right terrorist Anders Breivik, told Norway's TV2 channel that he did not regret the tone of his article. ""If the party leader says that Roma should be put in buses and transported back to the Balkans, this is quite clearly the language of a right-wing populist party,"" he told TV2. Meanwhile Pierre-Henry Deshayes, Norway correspondent for AFP, said that he believed that the party's criticism of international media coverage was part of a rebranding exercise aimed at a domestic audience. ""I think they are using the foreign media as a rebranding tool to make it more acceptable for the other parties to collaborate with them,"" he said. ""Two weeks ago the coverage was already happening, we were already noting that the timing was very weird for them to come to power, but they did not react because it was before the election and they still gained by seeming tough on immigration"". He accepted that it was unfair to describe Progress as the ""Breivik party"", as Italy's Corriere della Sera did in its election report. But he said it was difficult for Progress to argue that it was not anti-immigration. ""I still am waiting for the FrP [Progress Party] to say anything positive about immigration: it's all about the financial burden; its all about criminality; it's all about sneak islamisation. So in that respect I think it's fair to call them anti-immigration,"" he said. Solvik-Olsen told the conference he was disappointed that the international media continued to accentuate the fact that Anders Breivik had briefly been a party member. ""The ideas of one madman can not be linked to a party. It makes us very disappointed that this perception continues in the foreign media, even though the debate has long since been dead in Norway."" Himanshu Gulati, one of the party's rising stars, said that the membership of people of Indian origin like himself, showed that the party was not anti-immigrant. ""I think back to our summer camp this year. There were people from Somalia, Sudan, Morocco, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. If only a little of what is written about us was correct, I do not think we would have seen that so many immigrants supporting our party,"" he said. But journalists at the press conference pressed Solvik-Olsen on the party's use of the term 'sneak-Islamisation' in the past, forcing him to admit that it had been ""poor use of the word"". They also highlighted the rhetoric used by Christian Tybring-Gjedde, one of the party's most controversial politicians, who has claimed that Norway is digging its ""own cultural, ethnic and religious burial"" by allowing immigration to continue at present rates."

Since the start of the year, more than 5,000 migrants have crossed into Norway from Russia. Most are from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Iran. The route is longer, but safer, than crossing the Mediterranean.
Norway last week announced it would send back to Russia those migrants who held Russian residence permits or visas, since that country is deemed safe for refugees.

Norway, a country of 5.2 million, is not a member of the EU, but it is a member of Europe's Schengen zone, whose internal borders have been scrapped.
It has received some 30,000 asylum applications since the start of the year.
Most applicants have arrived in Norway via neighbouring Sweden, but since that country reinstated border controls on November 12th the flow has steadily declined: last week only 968 people sought asylum in Norway compared to 2,108 the previous week, a number that nonetheless remains much higher than normal."

“The challenge for the Nordic region is not an internal one, but the fact that Schengen's outer borders have broken down,” Solberg said.
“We must now make sure that the outer borders work,” she added as Europe struggles to cope with its worst refugee crisis since World War Two.
Schengen, which permits citizens of 26 states including non-EU member Norway to travel without passport formalities, is creaking under the strain of an unending flood of new arrivals with Germany, Austria and Slovakia reimposing border checks.
Solberg, whose Conservative Party is in a ruling coalition with the anti-immigration Progress Party, echoed concerns over Schengen expressed by French President Francois Hollande on Thursday.
Speaking to the AFP news agency, Hollande said Schengen was “in danger” due to the absence of registration centres to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants as EU states seek to share out some 120,000 asylum seekers, most fleeing the war in Syria.
Hollande said if there were no controls at the EU's external borders, states would feel obliged to restore national borders and controls “and it will be the end of Schengen.”
Solberg was speaking after a joint meeting with colleagues from fellow Nordic states hosted by Denmark.
Norway controls an external EU frontier with Russia, a border which has been crossed by more than 250 Syrian refugees so far this year.
Sweden's Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said “all those who have the right to asylum should be given it. Those who do not have the right should be sent back.”
And Danish counterpart Lars Lokke Rasmussen, a Liberal, agreed, saying: “Those who do not need protection should be sent back as quickly as possible.”
The crisis has sparked some disagreement between the Nordic states with Stockholm criticising Copenhagen for waving through some migrants to Sweden to make asylum claims.
Finland then criticised Sweden for doing the same in allowing a group of mainly Iraqi migrants to cross the border to make their own claims."

""We’ve not debated that yet, so I wouldn’t be able to say we’re in favour of it or against it,"" the 44-year-old leader said of a hard-line proposal to no longer recognise Islamic marriages for immigration purposes. The report, Sustainable Immigration, was put together by some of the party's most vehemently anti-Islamic and anti-immigration figures, such as deputy leader Per Sandberg, and Oslo politician Christian Tybring-Gjedde. It cites figures that show that each non-Western immigrant costs the equivalent of 42 years of an average Norwegian's tax payments, and calls for immigration from non-Western countries to be sharply reduced from from close to 20,000 a year to about 1,500 a year. In the interview, Jensen stressed that the report was not yet party policy. ""Some of these proposals will be more widely accepted, some are more controversial and need to be discussed. But I think the whole idea about this is to figure out how to make immigration more sustainable in the future."" Martine Aurdal, political editor of the Dagbladet newspaper and Jensen's biographer, said that since the twin attacks of Anders Breivik in 2011, Jensen had left more extreme rhetoric to others in the party. ""Siv Jensen used to talk about 'the hidden Islamisation of Norway', and she doesn't do that any more,"" she said. Jensen told The Local that she understood and felt compassion for immigrants. ""I truly understand why people want to move to a better place,"" she said. ""But then we need to be very clear about what are the playing rules around the country where you want to establish yourself. You need to facilitate work, and facilitate people’s ability to take part in society, rather than to be outside of society."" Although the immigration report cited Somali immigrants as one of the biggest drains on the Norwegian tax-payer, Jensen stressed that Somali people could often be entrepreneurial. ""The strange thing is that they seem to struggle here, whereas if you look at the US statistics, they’re quite successful, so it’s not probably the Somalis that represent the problem, it's the government’s policy. It’s an attack on the policy, rather than on immigrants."" As for Islam, she argued that problem was the way extremists refused to recognise the primacy of Norwegian law. ""We have to separate here between radical Islamic thoughts and secular Islam, and I think there’s a huge difference between the two,"" she said. ""I think that no society should be governed based on religious beliefs, because I believe in the freedom to believe in whatever you believe in and that you shouldn’t mix that with politics."" Jensen refused to accept that the country's Liberal and Christian Democrat parties, who last month wrote that they would refuse to be in a coalition with the Progress Party, were really seeking to block her party from government. ""I don’t think that’s what they said. They have said the same thing for a long time, which is that they would be more than happy to sit down with us and the Conservative party if the four of us gain a majority in the election and see if we have a big enough ground to form a coalition government. They’re a little bit more sceptical about being part of the government, but they would be able to support it."" She said that when she came under attack for her party's strong views, she drew on the example of her idol, the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. ""She was a very, very strong and she was loved and hated, and I think that’s something that a politician will go through if you have very clear statements and if you really want to make a difference. People will love you and people will hate you."" After a political career that started with her election to parliament at just 18 years old, she said that she and her party were now finally ready for power.

Tor Berger Jørgensen, the former bishop of Sør-Hålogaland in northern Norway, launched the campaign last week, arguing that breaking the law in this way was not about saving money, but about providing a livelihood to people “in a hopeless situation”.
The 71-year-old priest sent letters out to Christian organisations across Norway asking them to give jobs to those who could neither return to their home countries nor get residency in Norway. He told the newspaper he was “optimistic” that his call would be answered.
“There have been several positive responses from people who are now looking closely at what can be done,” he said. “I am quite optimistic that we can achieve something among church organizations and with church connections.”
Jørgensen made the call after reports that the IMI church, an evangelical church in Stavanger, had employed an Eritrean woman who had lived in Norway without a residency permit since 2011.
Immigration Minister Sylvi Listhaug has denounced the bishop's call as ""irresponsible"".
“What he is in fact doing is creating false hopes for people who have to return to their homeland,” she said. “Individuals who have received a final rejection of their asylum application are obliged to return home.”
According to Norwegian law, employers who use foreign workers who do not have the right kind of residence permit risk fines or imprisonment.
Berger Jørgensen is well-known as a liberal within the Church of Norway, pushing for the church to allow gay marriage and gay priests, and in 2009 ordaining a woman priest who was unmarried and living with the father of her child."

These bearded modern Vikings don protective suits and life jackets and brace for a mammoth nighttime mission that will see them transfer hundreds of people from an oil tanker, pluck others off unseaworthy boats, and help a woman give birth.
""Our mission is border control, but saving lives comes above everything,"" Pål Erik Teigen, the police officer in command of operations who heads the crew, told AFP during a week-long embed.
The vessel, part of the European border agency Frontex's Operation Triton, started life as an oil platform supply ship in the North Sea but now patrols the Mediterranean on the look-out for human, drug or weapon smugglers.
While suspected illegal activities will be flagged up to the Italian authorities, the Siem Pilot is not built for high-speed chases and does not have the authority to board suspect vessels. But what it can do -- at over 80 metres long -- is host a lot of rescued migrants.

Most of the rescues take place on the border between Libyan and international waters but Frontex vessels are not deployed there so as not to act as a draw for departures.
Ships run by NGOs usually pick up the migrants, and call for back up when needed. That is when the Siem Pilot and its crew of policemen, coast guards and civilians, springs into action.
Part of Triton since April 2015, its crew members serve month-long missions before returning to Norway.
Rescue missions are often recorded and uploaded to YouTube by the National Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos):

Ole Hadland Gjertsen, a 26-year old diver who is on his sixth mission with the Siem Pilot, is a cycling enthusiast who regularly brings his bike with him on board so he can take it for a spin on rest days, from Malta to the Amalfi coast.
A previous crew member left a guitar and during the peaceful periods, those who are not playing video games or poker gather on the top deck under the stars to sing Norwegian songs.
Friday is taco night -- just as it is for many in Norway -- and each day kicks off with a hearty porridge, eggs and smoked salmon.
But when the alarm is sounded, the crews throws itself into preparing blankets, water and food bars for up to 1,100 famished, exhausted and scared guests, some of whom come aboard with serious medical issues.
Whistling to be saved
Tensions rise during a nighttime operation to transfer some 900 migrants from a tanker to the Siem Pilot, with the two police officers deployed to oversee the transfer, calling for back up when scuffles break out over life jackets on the oil-slicked deck.
The sound of whistles fills the air as those left on dinghies plead for help and the crew works tirelessly for over 40 hours.
In all, the Siem has hosted some 28,500 migrants on board since it began working under Frontex.
With the rescue finally complete, some head for their bunks to sleep. One will be woken soon: doctor Hans Christian Vik, 31, is called to deliver a baby, born prematurely and evacuated at dawn on an Italian coast guard boat.
""It was the second baby I have ever delivered, and the first was in a hospital with all the necessary resources for an emergency. This was very different,"" he told AFP.
""But that's what we're here for,"" he said.
There is only one task left, and it is a grim one. With a refrigerated container big enough to take 70 stacked bodies, it falls to the Siem Pilot to take on those who did not survive the journey."

Moscow had previously agreed to take as many as 700 rejected asylum seekers but said on Wednesday it would only accept those who hold multi-entrance visas and legal residence, Thor Arne Aass from the Norwegian Justice Ministry told NTB
The meeting thus left the fate of 4,800 of the 5,500 people who came to Norway via the Arctic border crossing station Storskog last year uncertain.
Aass said that around half of the group of 700 migrants have already left Norway. Some 250 were returned to Russia, while an undisclosed amount were sent to their home countries.
Norway knows the whereabouts of some 200 rejected asylum seekers who can now be returned following the deal struck on Wednesday. Additionally, an unknown amount of people are unaccounted for.
During the Wednesday meeting between delegations from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russia's Federal Migration Service, the Russians stressed that the halt it put on returns over Storskog on January 22 was for practical reasons.
“We understand that. Both sides agree that it can be appropriate to return them to another location. And thus a flight to Moscow is an obvious solution,” Aass said.
Norway did not receive any guarantees from Moscow that there would not be new influxes of asylum seekers over Storskog in the future.
“We expressed that we have a shared interest in controlled and regulated immigration and that it is an unfortunate situation that this Arctic route has become a main channel into Schengen. The Russians agreed with us on this,” he said.
Throughout the course of 2015, 5,500 asylum seekers rode bicycles from Russia to Norway over the Storskog crossing as a way to sidestep border agreements that make it illegal either to cross the border on foot or to give someone without papers a lift.
At the end of November, Norway announced that it would immediately reject asylum seekers who have been residing in Russia. Moscow in turn began sending the denied migrants back to Norway before Oslo agreed to halt the returns on January 22.
Since Norway's November announcement, asylum seekers have all but abandoned the Storskog crossing.
Although Wednesday's meeting left a disagreement on the return of up to 4,800 people, the Russian authorities expressed a willingness to evaluate individual cases in which the rejected asylum seekers have a “special connection” to Russia.
Additionally, the Norwegian delegation was informed that the Russian authorities were investigating reports that a former diplomat in the Russian Foreign Ministry is behind five different companies that issued false work permits to around 1,000 Syrians.
“It is something the Russians are taking seriously,” Aass said."

“When we paid $22,000 to take the Arctic route to Norway, we didn't think about what sort of visa we received in Russia. Before the war in Syria, we had never been abroad,” a distressed Dallia Asaad told NTB in Kirkenes, where temperatures were at -30C.

Safe in Russia
Fifty to 60 people waiting to be returned to Russia found themselves on Wednesday at Ankomstsenter Finnmark, an asylum centre in Kirkenes. They have not had their asylum applications assessed but are being deported in line with the instructions the Norwegian government gave UDI before Christmas. The National Police Immigration Service Norway (Politiets utlendingsenhet - PU) plans to send a new bus full of asylum seekers out on Thursday. On Tuesday, 13 others were returned to Murmansk.
“Those who are being returned now are people who have valid residence in Russia. That means that they can safely live in Russia,” UDI's local leader in Sør-Vanger, Siri Rustad, told NTB.
She said that the Norwegian authorities' evaluation of Russia as a safe country must be honoured.
Not safe
Around 100 people demonstrated against the deportations on Wednesday night with torches and song.
“We are reacting very strongly to what is happening here, these inhumane transports out of Norway,” Eirik Nilsen from the group Refugees Welcome to Arctic told NTB.
“We do not believe it is safe at all [to send people back to Russia],” he added.
The Norwegian Helsinki Committee, which works closely with several organizations in Russia, has little confidence that the Russian authorities will take responsibility for the people being returned by Norway.
There is a real danger that people will be left on their own in northern Russia and could even freeze to death in the cold, senior adviser Inna Sangadzhieva said.
“They are left completely to themselves. If they don't have money and don't know the language, they will have to merely hope that someone can help them,” she told NTB.
Sangadzhieva used Wednesday to contact Civic Assistance Committee and other organizations that help illegal migrants and asylum seekers in Murmansk, Moscow and St. Petersburg, notifying the groups about Norway's plans to return rejected asylum seekers.
Given clothes and food
PU's leader in Kirkenes, Tor Espen Halga, said the agency views the deportations as justifiable.
“We make assignments on how they can take care of themselves, without me going into detail about it. But since you bring up clothing, I can say that we have made assessments on whether they are properly dressed,” he told NTB.
Those who need it are given warm clothing before their departure, he said. They are also given a packed lunch.
“We will drop them off in a city under our agreement with the Russian authorities – either Nikel or Murmansk. Then they must fend for themselves,” the police officer said, adding that the Russian authorities will then be responsible for what happens on their side of the border."

					09:21 CET+01:00				",Pierre-Henry Deshayes/AFP/The Local,'No means no': Norway sends migrants on anti-rape courses,"A look inside Norway's courses teaching refugees about sexual customs in their new country.
""She kissed him -- it's an invitation to have sex."" The asylum seeker's answer hangs in the air. The instructor's smile falters, and an explanation is required.
In Norway, migrants are being given courses to prevent violence against women, especially rape, and to teach them how to interpret customs in a country that may seem surprisingly liberal to them.
The courses were introduced several years ago, but have become particularly topical after complaints of mass sexual assault on New Year's Eve in the German city of Cologne, by a crowd of mostly Arab and North African men.
This particular morning at the Hå reception centre in southwestern Norway, a dozen Syrian and Sudanese asylum seekers fidget in their seats in a small room as their group discussion starts.
The curtains are drawn and a space heater blasts out hot air to heat up the room, but the participants keep their jackets on.
""The idea behind this course is to talk about risk situations that can arise when it comes to rapes and sexual assaults,"" the group's leader Linda Hagen says, kicking off the class in Norwegian, with an interpreter translating to Arabic.
""We need your help so that we can together detect these situations.""
What is the difference between love and sex? What do these pictures of women projected on a screen bring to mind, one with bare shoulders and the other veiled?
Can the use of violence be legitimate? How do you know if a woman is consenting to sex?
Cultural misunderstandings
The participants brainstorm scenarios where cultural differences may cause misunderstandings.
Little by little, they warm up and begin to speak.
""If she wants come to my place, that means she's consenting,"" says one Syrian.
""But if she's drunk, how can I be sure that she wants to sleep with me?"" asks a Sudanese man.
""If she says no, I don't do anything against her will,"" insists a third.
Those attending all seem to agree the course is useful.
""For me, I have no problem because my city is an open city and my sister, my mum, they're very similar to (the women) here,"" a 42-year-old Syrian tells AFP, asking to use the pseudonym Mikael Homsen.
""But I have friends, they come from a different culture, from a strict family. For them, any part a woman shows (is) a sign she wants to have sex,"" he says.
The need for the course -- which is organised by Hero, a private company that runs 40 percent of Norway's reception centres -- is exemplified when a video normally shown to secondary school students is screened:
In the clip, a party is in full swing. Two teens are making eyes at each other and they kiss. The boy pulls the girl, visibly tipsy, upstairs to a room and locks the door behind them.
He becomes increasingly physical with her, despite the signs of resistance she is displaying. ""No means no,"" concludes the video.
But the video meets with a range of reactions from the participants.
""He tricked her but the girl should also have been clear and said no and not gone upstairs with him,"" says one.
""If a girl kisses me, I figure she wants to sleep with me,"" says another.
Linda Hagen intervenes, explaining: ""In Norway, it's quite common to hug, to entwine, to dance very closely without it necessarily leading to a sexual encounter.""
""Everyone is in agreement that rape is bad,"" she later tells AFP. ""But there are all these grey zones, these situations that are a little difficult to grasp... The problem can arise with any of us.""
'Arena for dialogue'
Hero launched its course after a series of rapes committed by foreigners in the southwestern town of Stavanger between 2009 and 2011.
""We invite the residents, both women and men, to have a dialogue about cultural norms and to take responsibility if they see something,"" says Hero's director Tor Brekke.
""It's not a magic formula, it's just mostly about making an arena for dialogue.""
The Cologne incidents are on everybody's mind: 766 police reports filed, including 497 for sexual assault, which police have blamed on Arab and North African men.
""In my opinion it's not men who did that. They're animals. They're sick people,"" says Sulaiman Adel, a 42 year-old Syrian.
""We want German authorities to say who exactly did this, and not just say they're asylum seekers,"" adds Shero Demir, a 35-year-old also from Syria.
""They have to be expelled immediately to the country they're from. They can't live here."""

Asylum seekers whom Norway has expelled to Russia are being sent back to Norway in violation of a bilateral agreement between the two countries, Oslo said on Sunday.
""It is our opinion that Russia is obligated to take back those people whom we are sending back to Russia,"" Joran Kallmyr, a state secretary in the justice ministry, told AFP.
Kallmyr would not disclose how many asylum seekers were concerned.
Since the start of the year, at least 4,000 asylum seekers have made a long detour through the Arctic to cross the border between Russia and Norway, which is a member of the Schengen agreement on free movement even though it is not a member of the European Union.

By comparison, only ten asylum seekers made the crossing last year.
Norway has received no ""satisfactory"" explanation from Russia about why the numbers have soared for those coming into Norway, while at the same time, neighbouring Finland, which is a member of the EU but not of Nato, has received almost no migrants via Russia.
Norway last week announced it would begin sending back to Russia those asylum seekers who have Russian residency permits without processing their asylum requests, arguing that Russia was a safe country for them.

Kallmyr would not disclose whether the asylum seekers now being sent back to Norway had Russian residency permits.

""Russian authorities recently confirmed that foreign citizens with permanent residency or a multiple-entry visa can be sent back by bus,"" Norwegian police said in a statement.
Some 5,500 migrants -- mostly from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran -- crossed last year from Russia into Norway, on the last leg of an arduous journey through the Arctic to Europe.
Norway is not within the European Union, but is a member of the Schengen passport-free zone.
In November, the country's right-wing government decided that migrants who had been living legally in Russia, or entered Russia legally, should be immediately returned there, on the basis that Russia is a safe country.
Since then the police had been quietly putting migrants on bicycles back across the Storskog border crossing, 400 kilometres (about 250 miles) north of the Arctic Circle.
Bicycles became the preferred mode of transport of migrants seeking to cross into Norway, because Russian authorities do not let people cross the border on foot and Norway considers people driving migrants across the border in a car or truck as human traffickers.
NGOs had expressed outrage at the migrants being forced to retrace their steps on two wheels in winter, when temperatures in the region regularly fall to -20C (-4F).
""It's much better to return people with Russian residency permits in a dignified manner,"" Jon Ole Martinsen of the Norwegian Organization for Asylum (NOAS) said.
The police were unable to confirm the number of people expelled by bicycle, saying only a total of 371 people had been returned to Russia last year.
""They were given bicycles at the border... In many cases, they used them to carry their bags and pushed them 200 or 300 metres"" to the Russian side of the border, Daniel Drageset, a spokesman for the immigration police, told AFP, assuring they were ""adequately dressed"" for the weather."

Pedalling a bicycle through a freezing blizzard, Rehman finally crosses the border between Russia and Norway where he hopes to be given asylum, half a world away from his home in Pakistan.
""It's snowing. It's slippery and very cold, and very hard because some people don't know how to bike,"" says the strapping and affable 34-year-old, exhausted but relieved to have reached the end of his long odyssey.
While hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, persecution and misery are crossing the Mediterranean in unseaworthy dinghies, each day about 100 people are opting for the longer, but usually safer, ""Arctic route"", the northern European gateway to the Schengen zone.
The last stretch of the journey must be completed by bicycle because Russian authorities do not let pedestrians cross the border and Norway considers it human trafficking to transport migrants in a vehicle.
""I checked on the internet and saw that Norway has an open border,"" says Hichem, a 24-year-old Tunisian, echoing a widely held belief that the Scandinavian country is trying to quash.
With a 15-day Russian tourist visa, Hichem flew from Tunisia to Moscow and then boarded a train to Murmansk, before hopping in a taxi to Nikel, a small town near the Norwegian border 185 kilometres (115 miles) away.
The only land entry point between Russia and Norway, the small Storskog border crossing is 400 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.
Wooded snow-covered valleys, frozen lakes, starry night skies lit up by the greenish flames of the Northern Lights: the pristine nature here resembles something out of a fairytale but its tranquility can be unsettling for the unaccustomed.
But it doesn't seem to put off refugees -- not even the subzero temperatures.
More than 5,000 migrants have crossed the border since the beginning of the year, compared with only 10 in 2014.
""There's way too much snow,"" complains Hichem, jumping up and down quickly to keep warm as the mercury hits -15C (5F) outside the former military barracks that now house the newly arrived refugees.

Crossing the Arctic in sneakers
Shivering and rosy-cheeked, with their shoulders pressed up around their ears, groups of refugees arrive every day, usually in clusters of five or six at a time.
Some carry suitcases and push their bikes across the border. Others bravely pedal down the snowy road, not stopping until they reach their goal. A young mother clutches the handlebar of her bike tightly with one hand, struggling to carry her infant bundled up in a snowsuit in the other.
Wearing jeans and down jackets, many refugees have just sneakers on their feet -- a sharp contrast to the big fur lined boots worn by locals.
In the refugee centre where they are transferred, they are given a kit more appropriate for the colder climate: a warm coat, ski pants, a hat and gloves.
Inside the centre, the furnishings are spartan in order to make as much space as possible for bunk beds.
Rehman stayed in Russia for almost a year on a student visa. Annoyed by the corruption he saw everywhere, he decided to leave for Norway.
Getting off the train in Murmansk, ""police caught us and they said 'Give us your money if you want to go to Norway'. I said 'Why give you money, we don't have money! We're going to Norway because we have problems',"" he recalls, puffing on a cigarette.
He is however one of many who risk being sent back to Russia. Norwegian authorities have said they want to send back to Russia those who have been granted residency or a visa there, arguing that it is a safe country for them.
Mounir, a 50-year-old Tunisian, also made the heart-wrenching decision to leave his restive homeland.
In Kirkenes, he may be freezing cold but he feels free. The cold -- and the darkness that falls in mid-afternoon at this time of year -- don't bother him.
He hopes to stay in Norway and bring over his wife and the rest of his family.
But he still can't believe he had to fork out 10,000 rubles (about 145 euros, $155) for the children's bike he had to buy to cross the border.
""It's very expensive for those who arrive here after a long journey, who have no money and are looking for a safe haven,"" he railed. ""One of us had to stay behind because he didn't have enough money."""

In a bid to prevent violence against women, Norway is offering asylum seekers courses in how to interpret mores in a country that may seem astonishingly liberal to them.
A debate on integration has flared in Germany after New Year's Eve attacks in Cologne, where more than 100 women reported being sexually assaulted or robbed by men described as being of Arab or North African origin.
Questions are also being raised about how to integrate men from patriarchal societies into Europe, where emancipated women dress skimpily, go out, and drink and party.
""Our aim is to help asylum seekers avoid mistakes as they discover Norwegian culture,"" explained Linda Hagen of Hero, a private company that runs 40 percent of Norway's reception centres for asylum seekers.
""There's no single cultural code to say what is good or bad behaviour because we want a free society,"" she said.
""There has to be tolerance for attitudes that may be seen as immoral by some traditional or religious norms.""
After what she called a ""wave of rapes"" committed mostly by foreigners in the southwestern town of Stavanger between 2009 and 2011, Hero launched a course at some of its centres that touches on cultural differences regarding women.
The course, which Hero has tacked onto the immigration agency's broader, mandatory introduction programme to Norway, addresses the problem of sexual assault, using concrete examples for the participants to discuss.
See also: Immigrants in Denmark to be taught about sex
""It could be an 18-year-old guy who says he's surprised by the interest some Norwegian girls are showing in him. He assumes they want to sleep with him,"" Hagen said.
""So the group leader will ask him: Who are these girls? Where do you meet them? How do you know it is sex they want? Not all women in Norway are the same,"" she added.
To avoid stigmatising immigrants, the role of sexual predator in these scenarios may be assigned to a Norwegian.
""We turn the roles around a bit because there are rapists in all ethnic groups,"" Hagen said.
Xenophobic blogs are however rife with reports of violent attacks allegedly committed by foreigners, including a November incident in which a 12-year-old girl was physically molested by two underage asylum seekers.
Experimenting with dialogue groups
""This programme can only have a short-term effect, given the attitudes abroad where women are oppressed,"" said Hege Storhaug of the anti-immigration group Human Rights Service.
""To put an end to these attitudes, immigration has to first be restricted, then you have to concentrate on the newly-arrived immigrants and the second generation to assimilate them to our basic values, such as gender equality,"" she said.
While on a much smaller scale than the Cologne assaults, other incidents have been reported involving foreigners on New Year's Eve in Helsinki and Zurich, in countries that have opened their doors to migrants to a much lesser extent than Germany.
See also: Zurich women assaults 'similar' to Cologne's
""I fear that problems like this are going to increase in intensity in the coming years,"" said Storhaug, who said she has observed, especially among Muslim foreigners, an ""extremely sexualised and degrading"" view of women.
""Women's freedoms are already on the decline in Europe.""
But awareness programmes for migrants are not a cure-all.
""I don't think a course on its own can protect us from things that depend so heavily on social structures,"" admitted psychologist Per Isdal.
""To prevent sexual assaults by men, you have to provide good living conditions, such as a job and housing, and combat poverty.""
Together with the Alternative to Violence (ATV) foundation, Isdal has devised another, broader programme of ""dialogue groups"" focused on preventing violence, including sexual attacks, which were run as a nationwide experiment in 2013 and 2014.
In these classes too, rather than having a teacher instructing students, the emphasis is on groups holding discussions and exchanges of ideas, moderated by specially-trained ATV employees.
""The first reactions were partly negative among ... some reception centre employees who wanted to defend the asylum seekers. They were worried that the project would be stigmatising,"" Isdal said.
""But the asylum seekers themselves found these dialogue groups very helpful.""
Norwegian migration authorities, whose capacities have been strained by the influx of migrants last year, have yet to decide whether to pursue the dialogue groups."

And in Nikel on the Russian side, there are fewer and fewer waiting to come to the Kirkenes asylum centre.
In late October, hundreds of refugees arrived at a hotel in Nikel, which served as a focal point for many people waiting to go to the Norwegian border to seek asylum. This week there are just a few families left, NRK reported.
“Last night [Wednesday] I was at the hotel that many use as their final stop before going over to the Norwegian side. A few weeks ago, there were hundreds of people in the hallways. Now there are just a few families in the rooms – maybe 20-30 people,” NRK journalist Bård Wormdal said.
He said that those remaining have tried to cross the border numerous times and have refused to give up.
Tightening of rules
On Monday, police in Eastern Finnmark began acting on new stricter requirements regarding who is allowed to come over the border to Norway. This means that border control agents are now assessing asylum seekers' identification papers before they even leave the Russian area. As a result, asylum seekers are essentially stopped before they even come to Norway.
“Once again, no asylum seekers crossed over Storskog today,” Eastern Finnmark Police announced on Thursday evening for the fourth time this week.
Thus, there have been zero asylum seekers across the border so far this week, compared to 492 in the previous week and 1,113 in the week before that.
NTB contacted the National Police Immigration Service Norway (Politiets Utlendingsenhet - PU) on Thursday evening, but PU had no exact figures on how many asylum seekers had been stopped at the border.
Asylum strife
The new rules have led to disagreements between Russia and Norway, with Russian authorities unwilling to accept the dozens of asylum seekers that Norway has tried to return. Some have reportedly been denied re-entry to Russia because Russian authorities ruled that they only have transit visas and not residence permits.
On Tuesday, senior Norwegian and Russian experts met in Moscow, with both parties agreeing to maintain an active dialogue in order to find a solution, the Russian Embassy in Norway wrote on its Facebook page.
“Participants in the talks agreed to work toward a consensus on the ‘Borisoglebsk-Storkog' border crossing for third-country nationals and people without citizenship, and to step up work to clarify the new rules within the Norwegian immigration laws,” the embassy wrote.
Constructive dialogue
On Friday, the two countries were due to exchange written proposals for a common understanding on readmission agreements. That will be followed by a new meeting.
Norwegian Foreign Minister Børge Brende said that while the Norwegian–Russian dialogue at the senior official level is productive, he has no plans to bring the talks up at the ministerial level.
“Right now, it's about a legal understanding of what is included in the agreement and the possible need to clarify certain elements within it. Since that dialogue is moving along, I think we should keep it at that level,” Brende told NTB."

""It's easier to be blamed for things that are not going well than to get credit for things that go well,"" noted University of Oslo political science professor Bernt Aardal.
""You can see that the affluence of the Norwegian voters also leads to increased expectations. It is very difficult for any party to fulfil those expectations,"" he added.
After coming to power in 2013, the government -- made up of the Conservatives and the populist Progress Party -- has had to contend with two serious and simultaneous challenges.
The migrant crisis that swept across Europe saw a record 31,000 people seek asylum in 2015 in Norway, a country of 5.3 million. And the oil industry, the main driver of the Norwegian economy, has been hit since 2014 by the sharpest drop in oil prices in 30 years.
Europe has since shut it borders, Oslo has tightened its immigration policy, and the flow of refugees has dwindled.
Thanks to tax cuts and hefty withdrawals from the country's sovereign wealth fund -- worth almost $1 trillion just 20 years after its first deposit of oil revenues -- Norway has enjoyed a robust return to growth, depriving the opposition of an easy line of attack.

""Now that the Norwegian economy is improving, it's important not to change course,"" insists 56-year-old Solberg, presenting herself as the safeguard for continued success.
The cherry on the cake: Norway was in March named the happiest country in the world in a respected UN report.
Despite the glowing report card, Støre has accused the right-wing government of making Norway a ""colder"" place, championing himself as the defender of the less advantaged.
The opposition leader has promised to reverse tax cuts benefiting ""the richest"" and to beef up the welfare state.
""We have a strong immune defence against social things we've seen in other countries,"" the 57-year-old Labour leader told AFP.
""But we are not immune, which means that we too have increasing inequality.""
Public opinion remains divided.
""We want change,"" said Silje Krokeide, a medicine postdoc visiting a Labour campaign hut on Oslo's Karl Johans Gate avenue.
""We want more equality, that's important for me. And we also want to take better care of the environment.""
Eirik, a 69-year-old entrepreneur, is among those who want the right to stay in power.
""They've reduced taxes, introduced incentives for establishing new businesses, they've built roads and invested in police and health care. I think they've done pretty well.""
The election outcome will depend on the scores of smaller parties, as both the Conservatives and Labour depend on their support in parliament to form a government and pass legislation.

Earlier this week, reports from a meeting of local leaders in Troms suggested that the party wanted Norway to follow the controversial line adopted by southern neighbour Denmark by confiscating jewellery and other valuable items from refugees.
But parliamentary leader Harald T. Nesvik has now moved to reject suggestions that the Progress Party wishes to adopt the policy. However, Nesvik said it is fair to ask refugees who have savings to pay for their stay in Norway.
“When somebody on Norway claims welfare benefits, the type of savings they have will be assessed. There could be many coming to Norway with savings, so I think we should assess whether they should pay towards some of the actual costs incurred while we review their case,” Nesvik told Nettavisen.
On Tuesday, Denmark approved a controversial law that allows authorities to confiscate cash and valuables worth more than 10,000 Danish kroner from asylum seekers.

Progress spokesman Mazyar Keshvari previously told broadcaster NRK that Denmark's policy was a reasonable demand. But Nesvik has now dismissed the suggestion that his party wants to confiscate valuable items.
“We have not dealt with any proposal related to this case, and Progress has never said that we want to wait at the border and take people’s jewellery,” Nesvik told Nettavisen.
PM Erna Solberg made it clear that Norway would not be copying Denmark's much-discussed bill.
""It's not current Norwegian policy. One can be both rich and persecuted according to the Refugee Convention. That should be a fundamental principle for our treatment [of asylum seekers],"" she told NTB.
At the same time, the PM said that asylum seekers in Norway won't necessarily have access to all of the country's free services if they have the ability to pay themselves.
Solberg's Conservative Party (Høyre), the Liberals (Venstre) the Centre Party, the Socialist Left Party, Labour, the Green Party and the Christian Democrats all distanced themselves from Denmark's 'jewellery law'."

“It's both Syrians and Afghans. Thus far, we have reached a figure of 40 after going around and counting,” the centre's deputy leader, Hilde Meyer, told VG.
The centre has room for 280 people. According to Meyer, it is predominately young, single men who have disappeared.
“They left because they heard that the police had come to the centre and they are afraid. We haven't slept well these past few months because we think the police can come at any moment and take us,” an unnamed asylum seeker at the centre told broadcaster NRK.
Over the weekend, around 70 people were brought from other asylum centres to Ankomstsenter Finnmark in Sør-Varanger after Norwegian and Russian authorities agreed that Norway could send rejected asylum seekers back over the border via bus.
The asylum seekers said on Monday that they had started a hunger strike in protest of their treatment and what they say is a lack of communication.
On Tuesday, TV2 reported that a significant number of asylum seekers in Finnmark had been told to prepare for return to Russia and Barents Observer wrote that between 60 and 70 asylum seekers were to be transported by bus to Murmansk.
Norway announced in November that migrants who had been living legally in Russia, or entered Russia legally, would be denied asylum and returned to Russia.
Since then, the flow of migrants and refugees crossing the border at Storskog has slowed to a trickle."

The lowest number of births since 2003 was also recorded in 2017, giving, in combination with low immigration and high emigration, the lowest population growth rate in the country since 2005, according to a report published by Statistics Norway.
""Net immigration to Norway has more than halved in five years, and emigration is high,"" Statistics Norway senior analyst Marianne Tønnessen told NRK.
Figures published by the agency on Friday show that, of the last 30 years, only two other years - 2002 and 2003 - had fewer births than in 2017.
Norway's population increased by 37,000 in 2017.
""Emigration is now higher than during the great waves of migration [from Norway] to America at the end of the 19th century. Emigration figures are high. We are still country of immigration, but in the shadow of immigration, emigration has increased a lot,"" Tønnessen said.
Polish citizens remain the largest group of immigrants living in Norway by nationality, but there are also changes to the figures within that group, with the smallest net migration to Norway from Poland since 2004, when the country joined the EU.
""There is a large decrease in net migration from typical 'worker' countries. The reason could be that the situation in Norway is not as attractive as it has been in other periods, as well as situations in home countries improving,"" Tønnessen told NRK.
""Norway still has an increasing population, which not all European countries have,"" she added.

					09:45 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Norway to deport or jail rioting asylum children,"Norway is threatening to imprison or even deport a group of teenaged asylum seekers after they mounted a rebellion at a reception centre 50km north of Oslo.
The 20 youths last week barricaded themselves inside the gym at the Lunner Reception Center, throwing stones at police in protest at the decision to move one of the youths — who police believed had lied about his age, and was in fact over 18.
“It will probably have consequences for their residency permit assessment,” Jøran Kallmyr, from Norway’s Ministry of Justice told NTB newswire about the protest. “As we saw at Lunner if can be difficult to deal with young people who are seeking asylum alone. It may turn out that a person isn’t under 18 and should perhaps be returned.”
Save the Children accused Kallmyr, who is from the anti-immigration Progress Party, of seeking to demonize the children.
“It’s kind of horrible what they’re planning. These people are just children and they haven’t really received any treatment for traumatic experiences,” said Karoline Steen Nylander, the charity’s press spokesman.
“As a child rights organization, we really disagree with the politics, but also with the rhetoric.
She said that the children and teenagers were frequently referred to as “unaccompanied minors”, “juveniles”, or even “criminals”.
Much of the media also argued that they were “anchor-children”, sent alone to Norway to get residency so the rest of the family can then enter the country through family reunion laws."

					11:40 CET+01:00				", The Local,Nordic welcome chillier as numbers snowball,"Asylum seekers flowing to Scandinavia are finding chillier welcomes as their numbers surge and far-right parties increasingly assert their influence on immigration policy, analysts say.
Denmark, Norway and Finland – but also Sweden, until now especially welcoming to migrants – have begun cutting back the benefits they offer to newcomers while also hardening their asylum policies.
""It seems there's a certain amount of competition aimed at not offering the most generous social benefits to asylum seekers,"" said Asle Toje, a Norwegian international relations expert.
Denmark's immigration policy has grown tighter since 2001, when the far-right Danish People's Party (DF) began influencing policy-making.
In July, soon after elections made DF the country's second-largest party, Denmark moved to slash benefits to asylum seekers in a bid to reduce the influx. Under the new rules, which came into effect in September, a recently arrived immigrant without children now receives 5,945 kroner (€797, $897) per month, compared with the 10,849 kroner they got previously.
The move seems to have had the desired effect, since the number of asylum seekers declined in September from a year earlier while setting records elsewhere in Europe.
Syrians, Afghans and Eritreans are still arriving en masse in Denmark, but they generally move on to destinations considered more hospitable.
""Many of them say that the conditions are better for them in other countries, perhaps Sweden, and so they go there,"" said DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl.
DF, an indispensable ally of Denmark's minority Venstre government, is doing all it can to make the country less attractive to refugees.
'Generous welfare states'
Norway and Finland, both led by governments with anti-immigration elements, are similarly moving to cut back social services and toughen conditions for uniting families and granting citizenship or permanent residency.
""It's clear that the Nordic countries have generous welfare states, but we must ask ourselves if we should share them with those who come in,"" said Norway's justice secretary of state, Joran Kallmyr, of the right-wing populist Progress Party.
Norway, an island of prosperity thanks to its hydrocarbons, is becoming unsure of preserving its comfortable lifestyle as oil prices decrease.
Even ultra-liberal Sweden, despite taking in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU state – the country is expecting around 190,000 this year for a population of under 10 million – has decided to tone down its image of generosity.

In line with the rise of the far-right Sweden Democrats party, the kingdom is now demanding that its European partners share more of the burden, and it plans to harden conditions for reuniting families.
Sweden's ""Social Democrats are worried about losing voters to the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who were capitalizing on people's fears over mass migration to Sweden,"" said Magnus Hagevi, political scientist at Linnea University.
""Already we've witnessed a rash of arson attacks on migrant facilities across Sweden – people are also worried about the price of immigration. Many people are worried about what the future will bring and how that will affect the welfare state,"" he said.
Again on Saturday, a planned refugee shelter was burned down in Sweden, the latest in a string of suspected arson cases targeting a huge influx of migrants.
Using social media
The Nordic countries are also trying to use the media to help them stop the flow at its source.
In September, Denmark took out advertisements in the Lebanese press warning about new asylum regulations in the hope of discouraging Syrian refugees.
Norway and Finland have tried to get the message across on Facebook, where the bulk of migrants turn to compare possible destinations.

""Human traffickers spread rumours on social networks to sell trips by making people believe they should leave for Europe now because the borders are open,"" Kallmyr said. ""We should correct these rumours... and spell out what awaits them – less aid, difficulty reuniting families and lots of rejected requests.""
Toje had a more nuanced view.
""Refugees are not coming here mainly to take advantage of the welfare state,"" he said. ""They are fleeing countries where there is war, conflict and hardship. So even if we reduce services, I don't think that will necessarily lessen the number of asylum seekers."""

					07:57 CEST+02:00				",The Local,FEATURE: How to get a job in Norway,"Norway has been ranked as the most attractive country for migrant workers in Scandinavia. But that doesn't mean it's easy to get a job. Oslo-based journalist Audrey Andersen explains how it's done.
Norway has been ranked as the most attractive country for migrant workers in Scandinavia. But that doesn't mean it's easy. According to a recent study by the University of Bergen, Norwegian employers favour ethnic Norwegians even when a foreigner is better qualified for the job. The key message to take on board is that unless you work extremely hard to integrate yourself into Norwegian culture, your job prospects will be limited. So the very first step to getting a Norwegian career is to make yourself as proficient as possible in the language. Language requirements If you come to Norway from a non-EU country to work, you need to complete 300 hours of tuition in Norwegian, unless you are a citizen of one of the Nordic countries. This is actually very useful. While having English as a first language does provide a definite advantage, a good knowledge of both written and spoken Norwegian provides better access to work opportunities. There are excellent state-provided Norwegian classes which allow immigrants to learn Norwegian and acquire a good knowledge of how things work in Norway. Permits A new registration scheme now allows EU nationals to live and work in Norway without applying for a residence permit, as long as they register with the police. All EU nationals who want to stay in Norway for more than three months must register with the police, showing that they have a basis for residence, presenting a valid identity card or passport, and submitting documents proving that that they will not be a burden on the public welfare services. For immigrants coming from outside the EU, the process is more complicated. Up-to date information and applications procedures are available at the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirtektoratet). www.udi.no. Job seeking sources Writing a good cover letter and CV is the first but most important step in successful job seeking. The application letter should then be adapted towards each individual job application. When applying for jobs advertised in Norwegian, it is best to have your CV translated into Norwegian. The CV should include key information from previous jobs and a short personal description. The aim is to convince employers of how motivated you are to work for them. It can work well to approach prospective employers even when no job has been advertised, as initiative tends to be viewed favourably in Norway. It may also be useful to use the Norwegian agency NOKUT, which verifies the educational achievements of foreign citizens. www.nokut.no. It is also a good idea to have a LinkedIn account where your CV can be viewed online. Recruitment agencies in Norway actively search for candidates on LinkedIn. Sites such as www.finn.no and www.manpower.no are also popular among job seekers and prospective employers. Experis, www.experis.no is the country’s largest recruitment company, specialising in IT, financial consultancy and engineering. Agencies such as Adecco (www.adecco.no), Capus (www.capus.no) and Orion (www.orion-search.no) are also key players in the Norwegian labour market. Norway’s stable currency and oil wealth has resulted in low unemployment and steady job creation. The country is now facing a shortage of 16,000 engineers, more than twice as many as last year. In particular, there is a national shortage of civil and petroleum engineers. Taxes Everyone resident in Norway is liable to pay taxes on all their income and wealth. You must also have a tax deduction card, which shows employers how much tax to deduct from your pay cheque, and complete an annual tax return, whether you are fully or partially liable to pay taxes in Norway. When tax returns have been processed, you will receive a tax settlement notice, which contains information about the income on which the tax assessment is based and how much tax has been deducted.
www.taxnorway.no. Politics While Norwegian employers do tend to prefer Norwegians, the political environment is generally positive towards employment policies which embrace immigrants working in Norway. Interviews In general, the dress code for job interviews is quite casual in Norway. While wearing a tie is not always unnecessary, it is advisable to dress neatly. Norwegians pride themselves on being punctual so being on time is important. It is also good to begin an interview with a firm handshake, and to maintain good eye contact thoughout. An interview panel can consist of anything from two to five people and interviews can take anything from 45 to 90 minutes."

The Danish government implemented spot checks on its border with Germany on January 4, the same day neighbouring Sweden began requiring photo identification from all passengers on trains, buses and ferries from Denmark to stem the migrant influx.
After rising slightly for two days, the number of asylum seekers has steadily decreased from a daily average of about 100 to just 17 on Wednesday, according to the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen).
Denmark's integration ministry and the Danish Red Cross, which runs most of the country's asylum centres, declined to comment on whether the fall was due to the border controls.

""There may be fluctuations, especially during winter when the number typically falls,"" the head of the asylum department at the Danish Red Cross, Anne la Cour Vagen, told the daily Politiken.
""But we didn't see that before Christmas and it's very hard to know why we have a low number right now,"" she added.
Norway received just over 200 asylum applications in the first two weeks of 2016, down from a peak of 2,500 per week in November, according to the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI).
Oslo introduced spot checks on its border with Sweden and on all incoming ferry arrivals on November 30 and has also begun sending back migrants entering the country from Russia if they have valid Russian residence permits or visas.

Sweden, until recently known for its generous asylum policies, has seen numbers drop from a weekly peak of nearly 10,000 in October to current number of only about 100 per day, according to the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket).
""Last fall we found ourselves in a situation were it was unsustainable and we had to take measures to reduce the number of asylum applications,"" said Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven.
Sweden introduced border controls on November 12 and the number of arrivals fell, and then dropped even further after migrants, beginning in January, were forced to show ID on trains, buses and ferries entering the country.

The Scandinavian country was among the European countries that received the largest number of migrants in 2015 in absolute numbers as well as per capita, with 163,000 asylum applications recorded in the country, which has a population of 9.6 million people.
Finland received 615 asylum seekers between January 4 and January 20, according to the Finnish Immigration Service. The number began to drop in November, from over 800 a week before Sweden introduced its border controls.
Indeed, the European Union's cherished passport-free Schengen area has come under huge strain, as many countries have reintroduced border controls to deal with the flow of migrants trying to reach the wealthy Nordic region from the main landing point in Greece."

					21:20 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,Schengen shows cracks with Tunnel incursions,"More than 100 migrants stormed the
Channel Tunnel early Saturday, penetrating a third of the way through and
attacking staff in an incident that halted overnight traffic.
The attempt to go through the tunnel from France to Britain came as the daily flow of thousands of migrants and refugees flocking to Europe's shores showed little sign of easing, with 168,000 migrants and refugees arriving in September alone, UN figures showed.
Most are seeking refuge in Germany or Sweden, but others have continued their journey to France in the hope of somehow crossing the Channel to reach England.
Traffic through the Channel Tunnel, which connects Britain and France, was halted for more than seven hours after a group of 113 migrants stormed into the tunnel in the hope of reaching the other side.
Train journeys resumed Saturday but with delays of up to three hours.
Eurotunnel, which operates the complex, said the incident was unprecedented, with migrants aggressively attacking its staff.
""This has never been seen before, it was a determined and well-planned attack,"" a spokesman told AFP of the incident, which took place shortly after midnight (2230 GMT Friday) at the entrance to the tunnel near the northern French port city of Calais.
He said the group ""ran through the terminal, pinning a number of staff members to the ground and throwing stones at them.""
A police source told AFP that earlier Friday evening there had been a substantial movement of migrants through Calais and towards the tunnel entrance ""in the presence of No Border militants"" -- an activist group backing free movement in Europe.
As Europe struggles with its biggest migration crisis since World War II, thousands have made their way towards France's northern coast in the hope of finding passage across the Channel to England.
Fabienne Buccio, head of the Pas-de-Calais region, said the group had demonstrated ""a certain level of aggressiveness"" during the breach.
A determined attempt
""Normally they stop before the security forces, but this time they wanted to get through,"" she told AFP, saying they had managed to get a third of the way through the tunnel, which stretches some 50 kilometres (30 miles).
Buccio said two police and four migrants sustained light injuries in the incident.
French border police were repairing a large breach of nearly 30 metres (yards) in one of the many fences around the site.
Eurotunnel said it had closed the tunnel at around 12:30 am (2230 GMT on Friday) and services resumed by around 8:00 am.
Shortly afterwards, there was another attempt at Calais port when 300 migrants tried to get into the terminal through several different entrances as well as trying to board lorries, port security officials told AFP.
But they began to disperse when the police turned up around 10:30 am and blocked off the ring road leading to the port, an AFP correspondent said.
In August, the interior ministers of France and Britain signed an agreement to set up a new ""command and control centre"" to tackle smuggling gangs in Calais.
The move came after several weeks of attempts to penetrate the sprawling Eurotunnel site, the biggest of which was on August 3, when there were 1,700 attempts to get in.
Since then, major work to step up security has seen new barriers erected and more staff deployed along with sniffer dogs. The number of attempted break-ins has fallen to around 100 per night, police say.
Such attempts can be fatal: in the past three months, some 13 people have died while trying to reach the tunnel.
'Schengen's borders broken'
Meanwhile at Hungary's Beremend crossing on the border with Croatia, buses were awaiting to pick up the new arrivals after 4,987 people crossed on Friday, taking to 300,159 the total number who have entered so far this year.
Similar scenes were playing out on Croatia's border with Serbia with buses waiting to ferry the new arrivals directly to the Hungarian border. Zagreb said it had logged 5,000 new arrivals on Friday, taking the total since mid-September to 100,066 people.
Hungary is attaching razor wire to a fence erected at its border with Croatia, in a possible prelude to sealing the frontier to thousands of migrants.
Austria said it registered 2,683 new arrivals on Friday and another 2,363 in the early hours of Saturday.
Tens of thousands of people marched in the Austrian capital Vienna on Saturday in solidarity with the migrants.

					20:22 CEST+02:00				",AFP,From refugees to nukes: The Nobel bets are on,"From the migrant crisis to the anti-nuclear camp, speculation is rife about who will win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, with Angela Merkel and John Kerry among the names mentioned.
The only one of the six Nobel prizes to be awarded in Oslo -- the others are announced in Stockholm -- the Peace Prize is the one that garners the most attention and speculation.
But predicting the winner is largely a game of chance, as the list of nominees is kept secret for 50 years. This year 273 names are known to be on the list.
Some Nobel watchers agree that the honours could go to those working to ease the migrant crisis, which has seen more than 630,000 people flee war and misery in the Middle East and Africa for Europe, testing the limits of the
continent's generosity.
According to the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (Prio), Kristian Berg Harpviken, the German chancellor is an obvious choice.
""Angela Merkel is the one who really took a moral leadership,"" he said.
In the same vein, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which has already won the prize twice in 1954 and 1981, and Eritrean Catholic priest Mussie Zerai, who helps rescue migrants crossing the Mediterranean, have been tipped as possible laureates by Nobeliana, a group of historians who specialise in the Nobel.
- Peace deals -
While the past year has been marked by violence and tragedy in Syria, Iraq and across Africa, there have also been a few momentous steps towards peace.
In July, Iran's regime reached a historic deal with world powers to curb its nuclear drive in exchange for a gradual lifting of the crippling sanctions imposed on its economy since 2006.
""I think the work of the Nobel Committee ... this year just got much easier,"" Sweden's former foreign minister Carl Bildt tweeted at the time.
In such a case, the prize could go to the architects of the deal, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, and possibly even EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini or her predecessor
Catherine Ashton, according to Peter Wallensteen, a professor at Sweden's Uppsala University.
If it were to make such a choice, the Nobel committee would continue its recent tradition of honouring anti-nuclear efforts in years marking the decade anniversaries of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
In 1975, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov received the nod, in 1985 it was the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, in 1995 it was Joseph Rotblat and the Pugwash movement, and in 2005 the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its director Mohamed El-Baradei.
According to Wallensteen, if one were to follow that line of thinking, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) could be another contender.
Another recent peace breakthrough possibly worthy of the prize was in Colombia, where the government and FARC guerrillas last month reached a deal on justice with the aim of signing a final peace agreement by March 23, 2016.
But, as with the Iranian deal, giving the award to President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Timoleon Jimenez now could be ""a bit too early,"" said Nobeliana member Asle Sveen.
- Bloggers, whistleblowers, the pope? -
Among other names mentioned as potential winners are Pope Francis, for his commitment to social justice and the environment, and Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege, who has treated thousands of women brutalised by rape in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
And as with every year, no Nobel speculation would be complete without the list of Russian activists and organisations who jealously guard their independence from President Vladimir Putin: activists Svetlana Gannushkina and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, NGOs Memorial and Agora, or the newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
""It starts to look like a sin of omission not to have given a prize in Russia's direction,"" Harpviken said.
The fight for freedom of expression could also be tapped in a year that has seen the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris and the Copenhagen attacks.
Denmark's Flemming Rose, who published the Mohammed cartoons in daily Jyllands-Posten in 2005, jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi and whistleblower Edward Snowden are names mentioned if the committee were to go that way.
Of course, the Nobel committee could also pull another name out of its hat -- the world will only know on Friday at 11:00am"

58-year-old Sandberg, who is also considered close to the FrP's populist wing, has often made headlines in the media.
In 1997, a court slapped him with a 3,000 kroner (around 400 euros) fine for hitting an asylum seeker from the former Yugoslavia at a late-night party at his home.
""I don't remember who started it, but the headbutting went off like a pure reflex and then it was over,"" Sandberg wrote in his 2013 memoir.
Social media users were indulging in the irony.
""It's a bit strange to have a justice minister with a police record which would make it impossible for him to work in the police or as a prison guard,"" a Twitter user said.
""Good news guys! If you've ever been convicted of violence against an asylum seeker, then the FrP has a job for you as acting Minister of Justice and Immigration,"" another tweet said.
Listhaug, who had been under fire for over a week, announced her resignation on Facebook, sparing Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg from calling a vote of confidence in the government, whose outcome was uncertain.
In a Facebook post on March 9th, Listhaug shocked the nation when she accused the opposition Labour Party of considering that ""the rights of terrorists are more important than the security of the nation"".
Labour members were the main victims of the bloodiest attacks on Norwegian soil since the Second World War when, on July 22nd, 2011, right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who once was a member of the Progress Party, killed 77 people in twin attacks targeting then-Labour prime minister Jens Stoltenberg's office in Oslo and another against a Labour youth camp on the island of Utøya.

					16:17 CEST+02:00				",NTB/The Local,Norway closes Arctic asylum centre as numbers plunge,"The once-busy border with Russia has seen no arriving migrants since November, leading immigration officials to discontinue a reception centre in Kirkenes.
With asylum numbers plummeting, Norway will close down an asylum centre in Finnmark that was set up last year to deal with an influx of migrants taking the so-called ‘Arctic route’ into the country from Russia.
The asylum centre in Kirkenes near the Storskog border station with Russia was established to house as many as 600 people. But with no migrants attempting to enter Europe by crossing into Norway from Arctic Russia since November, the centre will now be closed.
“The reason for the closure is that we have not had any arrivals of asylum seekers since November of last year,” Christine Wilberg, a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI), told VG.
UDI said recently that just 1,185 asylum seekers came to Norway in the first third of 2016 – a 95 percent decrease from the same period last year and the lowest figure since 1997.
Some 12,000 asylum accommodations currently sit empty across Norway.
More than 5,000 migrants crossed into Norway from Russia in 2015 before Norwegian police were stationed at the Storskog border station at the beginning of December. Once the controls were put in place, the migrant flow came to an almost immediate stop.
The Arctic route is significantly longer than crossing the Mediterranean but was seen by many asylum seekers and migrants as a safer alternative. Most of those who crossed into Norway from Russia came from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Those arriving made the last stretch of the journey by bicycle because Russian authorities do not let pedestrians cross the border and Norway considers it human trafficking to transport migrants in a vehicle.
A total of 31,145 people applied for asylum in Norway last year, nearly 20,000 more than in 2014. UDI originally anticipated that as many as 60,000 would arrive in 2016 but has now lowered that estimate to 25,000.
Norway, a country of 5.2 million, is not a member of the EU, but it is a member of Europe's Schengen zone, whose internal borders have been scrapped."

					13:15 CET+01:00				",The Local,Norway ministers advise against freeze on Afghan deportations,"Norway's foreign minister Ine Eriksen Søreide and immigration minister Sylvi Listhaug have both spoken in parliament over calls to freeze returns of rejected asylum seekers to Afghanistan.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Søreide has advised Norwegians against travelling to Afghanistan, but said the return of rejected asylum seekers was a separate issue.
Opposition parties have called Søreide and Minister of Migration and Integration Listhaug to an extraordinary discussion over the deportations, reports newspaper VG.
Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially advises against travel to Afghanistan, but the Directorate of Immigration (Utenriksdepartementet, UDI) does not currently define the war-torn central Asian country as too unsafe for asylum returns.
“We must face the fact that, in many countries, Norwegian travellers face many other threats than local citizens,” Søreide said in parliament according to VG's report, citing kidnapping threats against Norwegians.
Listhaug said she “advised in the strongest possible terms” against the parliamentary backing for the proposal to freeze asylum seeker returns to Afghanistan, broadcaster NRK reported on Wednesday.
“It is important that decisions are understood on a factual basis, and I would advise in the strongest terms against parliament supporting the proposal to freeze all returns to Afghanistan. That could have unwanted consequences,” Listhaug said.
The minister said that changing current practice could result in an increased flow of asylum seekers from Afghanistan to the Norwegian country, reports NRK.
“There are very few areas in Afghanistan considered so unsafe that everyone who comes from there has the right to protection,” she said.
“Thorough assessments are made of each case. Afghans with the right to asylum are given it,” she added.
A total of 130 rejected asylum seekers – of which 128 are from Afghanistan – will reach the age of 18 during the autumn, VG reported in September.
Norway's Socialist Left, Green and Red parties have called for the return of rejected asylum seekers to Afghanistan to be freezed until the security situation in the country becomes clearer.
The Socialist Left party has therefore tabled a proposal for an acute hold on all returns. A vote in parliament is expected next week, and would require the support of the larger opposition parties Labour and Centre in order to reach a majority.
Søreide made no secret of the fact that the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened in recent years.
“The armed conflict between the Afghan government and rebel groups continues unabated. Battles regularly occur in many of Afghanistan's 34 provinces and we have seen repeated terror attacks in both villages and towns. Both civil and military losses remain significant,” the minister said in parliament according to VG's report.

Siem Pilot arrived off the coast of Libya on June 12th to take part in Operation Triton, an EU border security operation. But Monday's rescue is its first major operation since arriving.
The refugees were crammed on board two small wooden boats, which were intercepted by Siem Pilot in a rescue operation which lasted for several hours.
“All of the migrants have been well taken care of by the crew of the Norwegian ship,"" Norway's National Criminal Investigation Service said in a press release. ""There were no dead people among those rescued, and no one seems seriously ill. There are several pregnant women among those saved.”
Aside from its Norwegian crew, Siem Pilot has medical and military personnel on board. The Norwegian ship has also taken on board 40 refugees from other ships in the area.
”The rescue operation went according to plan and I am satisfied that our training works in practice,"" Commander Tore Barstad told Norway's TV2 broadcaster. ""We got all of the migrants safely from the overcrowded boats they were in to smaller vessels used to transport them to Siem Pilot. They are being cared for by police and military personnel on board,”
´The migrants were then taken to Sicily, where Italian authorities took over responsibility for them.

Norway no longer the promised land for young Swedes,"The tradition of young Swedes flocking to Norway to find work appears to be coming to an end, with an estimated 60 percent decrease in recent years suggesting the slowing of the oil boom has stemmed mass movement west from Sweden in search of employment.
When the Norwegian economy was at its peak it was common for young Swedes to travel across the border to work in areas like the service industry and retail, attracted by the higher salaries on offer compared to back home and a favourable exchange rate.
But these days there is less Swedish being spoken on the streets of Oslo. The difference in salaries between the two countries is no longer so great, and that combined with it being easier to find jobs in Sweden is thought to be the explanation for the shift.
""It was some time around 2014-15 that we really started to notice it. We've had a decrease of around 55-60 percent when it comes to Swedish workers compared to how it was during its heyday,"" Angelika Wichmann from staffing company Kelly Services in Oslo told broadcaster SVT.
""Before there were busloads of young Swedes coming to look for jobs. Now we're having a hard time finding staff,"" said Jon Paulsen, recruitment head at agency Manpower, which also reported a 60 percent decrease.
As a consequence, Norwegian employers are now looking further east. Russia, Lithuania, Poland and Hungary are becoming popular nations to recruit staff from in an effort to try to fill the gap left by the now departed Swedes.
And there are even suggestions that a reversal of the Swedish-Norwegian exchange could be on the cards, as Swedish unemployment continues to decline and young Norwegians look for work.
Last year, financial experts started advising Norwegians to look for work in Sweden, particularly in the construction sector, teaching and computer engineering.
""Norwegians should seek their fortune in Sweden. It is certainly worth the trip,"" Terje Strøm, chief economist at the Ny Analyse institute in Norway noted in August."

Following inspection of the centre in 2015, the civil ombudsman wrote that children were being detained along with parents in serious circumstances, and that two children per year were witness to parents harming themselves. The ombudsman concluded that the centre was unsuitable for children.
Nevertheless, children with families scheduled for forced deportation from Norway were held at the centre 48 times during 2017. In 2016, 143 children were also placed at the centre with their parents, according to NRK’s report.
Families and teenagers unaccompanied by parents have hitherto been accommodated at the facility prior to forced deportation to their home countries. They are not allowed to leave the centre due to concerns by authorities that they will abscond before they can be transported out of Norway.
Residents at the facility caused damage to two of its wings during a protest in 2015.

""I spoke with the crew, who told me horrible stories. They are heroes who have saved over 3,000 people. When I was asked to see how they operate, of course I said yes. It would have been completely rude not to have done it,"" she told TV2."

					10:44 CET+01:00				",NTB/The Local,Illegal immigrant denied abortion in Oslo,"Oslo University Hospital has received a rap on the knuckles from a health service watchdog after it demanded advance payment from an undocumented migrant from West Africa who wanted an abortion.
The woman, who is in her early twenties, first informed medical staff of her unwanted pregnancy at the city’s Health Centre for Undocumented Immigrants, newspaper Aftenposten reports.
The clinic referred her to Oslo University Hospital, where an ultrasound examination confirmed that she was eight to nine weeks pregnant.
But instead of performing the abortion as requested by the patient, the hospital asked for payment in advance.
A medical abortion was not an option in the woman’s case, and a surgical abortion would have cost her 4,000 to 12,000 kroner ($650-2,000), a fee she could not afford.
The Health Centre for Undocumented Immigrants then made an appointment for her at the nearby Akershus University Hospital, where the abortion was duly carried out.
The health centre, run jointly by the Church City Mission and the Red Cross, subsequently lodged a complaint with the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, claiming Oslo University Hospital’s decision not to perform the abortion was indefensible.
The centre also called for the hospital to put in place new procedures for dealing with cases involving undocumented migrants.
The watchdog responded that a pregnancy in the eighth or ninth week does not automatically qualify a patient for the emergency care to which everybody living in Norway, legally or illegally, has a right.
However, the board also pointed out that all women living in Norway have the right to terminate their pregnancy before the twelfth week.
This, the board said, meant the hospital should have applied a rule that states: “The patient has the right to treatment if an evaluation shows that treatment should be provided within three weeks.”
Oslo University Hospital said it regretted the incident and had changed its procedures."

					09:56 CET+01:00				", The Local,Norway's rules 'stricter' than Denmark's controversial bill,"Denmark's bill allowing the confiscation of migrants' valuables has been heavily criticized, but both Norway and Germany have even stricter rules on how much money asylum seekers can bring in.
A long line of Norwegian politicians distanced themselves from Denmark's controversial bill allowing for the confiscation of cash and valuables from migrants, but Norway's rules on how much an asylum seeker can bring in to the country are actually stricter, broadcaster NRK reported.
Denmark on Tuesday approved a sweeping immigration bill that among other things gives authorities the ability to confiscate cash and valuables worth more than 10,000 Danish kroner (around 12,500 Norwegian kroner).

The Danish government has said that the cash and valuables will be used to offset asylum seekers' stay in the country and use of social services.
The regulations of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI), however, state that asylum seekers who enter the country with more than 5,000 kroner risk losing access to social benefits.
In contrast to Denmark, Norway's rules do not allow the police to confiscate any cash or valuables.
Still the lower monetary limit has led some to accuse Norwegian politicians of hypocrisy for joining in the international chorus of critics of the Danish law.
“If you just look at the value limit, the Norwegian rules are without a doubt more strict than the Danish law,” lawyer Cecile Schjatvet told NRK.
Christian Democrats spokeswoman Dagrun Eriksen said that few Norwegian politicians were aware of the rule. Now that it's come to her attention, she said the value limit should be raised.
“I want to change the current rules in Norway. Five thousand kroner is too low. Even though the authorities don't confiscate valuables worth more than 5,000 kroner, that isn't the same as having a ban against confiscation,” she told NRK.
Denmark's new bill has been heavily criticised by the international media and human rights groups.

Norway's rules aren't the only ones that are stricter than the provision passed in Denmark. Germany also long established rules on confiscating refugees' valuables which are stricter than those set out by the new Danish law.
In Bavaria - where the vast majority of refugees arrive in the country - cash and valuables are confiscated with a value of over €750 (5,600 kroner). In the neighbouring southern state of Baden-Württemberg the rules are even stricter. There, refugees can have valuables worth more than €350 (2,600 kroner) taken from them.
Meanwhile in North Rhine-Westphalia refugees are only allowed to have €200 (1,500 kroner) in valuables before local authorities start taking their possessions."

					08:19 CET+01:00				",Pierre-Henry Deshayes/AFP/The Local,"Trump, Snowden and Greek islanders in running for Nobel","Donald Trump, Greek islanders helping desperate migrants, Angela Merkel, Edward Snowden and the pope -- some may seem more likely than others but all are understood to be in the running for the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize.
Nominations for the award, won last year by four Tunisian groups that led the country's transition to democracy, must be posted to Norway by February 1 at the latest.
And as usual, the names of the nominees are a tightly-guarded secret -- or at least most of them are. Those who nominate candidates can reveal the name of the person they've proposed.
An online petition had on Monday picked up some 630,000 signatures calling for the Nobel to go the residents of Greek islands on the front line of Europe's migrant crisis, who have come to the aid of refugees turning up on their shores after perilous sea journeys from neighbouring Turkey.
The nomination, proposed by a group of university professors, faces a size problem: the prize can be shared by a maximum of three laureates.
Greek scientists have resolved the problem by putting three names forward: an octogenarian, a fisherman from Lesbos and the Hollywood actress-activist Susan Sarandon, who was the first high profile celebrity to visit the island to raise awareness about the issue.
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the 1984 Peace Prize, has backed three nominations, including one involving Greece's Good Samaritans called the Aegean Solidarity Movement.
""Just imagine 900,000 visitors in desperate need arriving at the door of your reasonably modest establishment. Hungry, exhausted and in a state of acute emotional distress... They don't speak the same language as you or ascribe to the same cultural or religious beliefs. What do you do? You open the door. Incredible!"" Tutu wrote on his foundation's website.
The two other nominations receiving his blessing were the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, and a trio that includes Pope Francis, hailed by the Anglican archbishop for ""consciousness about the ecological necessity to curb human consumptiveness and greed.""
Prize to a 'traitor'?
In an entirely different field, US Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has also been nominated for the prize, according to Nobel watcher Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo.
According to a copy of the nomination letter Harpviken said he had received, brash tycoon Trump – who has attracted international condemnation by calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States – deserves the prize for ""his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, ISIS, nuclear Iran and Communist China"".
Thousands of people around the world are allowed to make nominations for the Peace Prize, including members of parliament and government ministers, former laureates and some university professors.
The Nobel Institute accepts all valid nominations, so having one's name on the list is not to be taken as a sign of approval.
The five members of the panel that selects the laureate are also allowed to put forward their own nominations when they hold their first meeting on February 29.
Harpviken said he believed Edward Snowden, the American who exposed mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency, could be a winner this year.
""Snowden's leaks led to a good number of reforms in US practice and US legislation, which make it harder to still argue that he is a traitor to his country,"" Harpviken told AFP.
After a breakthrough on the Iran nuclear standoff, negotiators Ernest Moniz of the US and Ali Akbar Salehi of Iran are also among Harpviken's favourites, as well as Colombian peace negotiators President Juan Manuel Santos and rebel leader Timoleon Jimenez.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was one of the favourites last year when the prize went to Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet, is also in the running again this year.
The same goes for Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege, who has spent a quarter of a century treating thousands of women brutalised by rape and sexual violence in war-torn eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Nadia Murad, a Yazidi abducted by Isis fighters in August 2014 from her village in Iraq and held for three months as a sex slave is also in the running.
Finally, 118 Italian MPs have nominated the Afghan Cycling Federation women's team, hailing the bicycle as environmental, economic and democratic.
The winner of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced in early October."

					16:47 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Soldiers of Odin expand Norway patrols,"Volunteer street patrols calling themselves the Soldiers of Odin and claiming to protect locals from asylum seekers walked the streets of several Norwegian towns this weekend, as the group founded in Finland branches out across northern Europe.
This marked the second weekend that the group was seen in Norway, following their debut in Tønsberg earlier this month.
Dozens of men, some wearing black bomber jackets emblazoned with the group's Viking helmet logo, gathered on Saturday night in the streets of Stavanger, Drammen and Kristiansand, the group said on Monday.
""We want the streets to be safe, we want to get rid of the delinquency we see in Norway today which the police are unable to address,"" the group's Norwegian spokesman Ronny Alte told AFP.
""Drugs are being sold, girls are being touched, there are assaults and violence.""
The group is based on the Finnish Soldiers of Odin, which has links to neo-Nazis and was founded last year in response to a record number of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe, claiming that the influx has led to a rise in crime.
It now also has branches in Denmark and Sweden.
Alte, who was formerly a member of Islamophobic groupings such as the Norwegian Defence League and German-based Pegida, said the Norwegian branch of Soldiers of Odin ""represents the entire political spectrum"" and comes to the aid of everyone.
""But a large part of the crime we are focusing on is the result of the illegal immigration in Norway after Europe opened its borders,"" he said.
Like their Finnish counterparts, Norwegian police said they were ""generally sceptical of groups like the Soldiers of Odin.""
""The use of names [Odin is a god of war in Norse mythology, ed.] and symbols, and the fact that some of the members of the group have links to criminal circles, cement this scepticism,"" Atle Roll-Matthiesen, a high-ranking police official, told AFP.
""It's not acceptable that groups act or give the impression of being some kind of citizen self-defence group... Only the police are authorised to carry out policing duties,"" he added.
In Drammen, police on Saturday checked the identities of the patrol members and verified that they were unarmed.
In Kristiansand, the members were only authorised to hand out pastries and coffee.
The Norwegian intelligence agency PST's annual report published on February 9 said the ""threat from far-right circles was growing in Norway"" as a result of the migrant crisis.
The Nordic country of 5.2 million saw a record 31,000 migrant arrivals last year."

Revellers crammed into major cities across Europe to celebrate New Year with security tightened amid fears large crowds of people could present a target for extremists.
Celebrations swung into Europe with the night sky over Moscow's Red Square literally painted red by the fireworks.
In Berlin, revellers seemed undeterred by the deadly attack on a Berlin Christmas market on December 19, as they gathered under a freezing Berlin sky for a series of concerts and a large midnight fireworks display over the Brandenburg Gate.
Nearly 500,000 people gathered on Paris's famous Champs-Elysees, where the Arc de Triomphe was lit up with a colourful countdown to 2017 and the word ""welcome"" in dozens of languages.
The raucous celebrations drew to an end a year of political shocks, led by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. It has also been a year of celebrity deaths from David Bowie to Prince and Mohammed Ali. 2016 was also a year of bloodshed and misery that has seen the war in Syria, Europe's migrant crisis and numerous terror attacks dominate the headlines.
The German capital beefed up security, deploying extra police, some armed with machine guns.
""This year, what's new is that we will place concrete blocks and position heavy armoured vehicles at the entrances"" to the zone around Brandenburg Gate, said a police spokesman.
In Paris, nearly 100,000 police, gendarmes and soldiers will be deployed across France against the jihadist threat and President Francois Hollande inspected the security measures on the Champs-Elysees.
But fireworks returned to the French capital, after muted 2015 celebrations following the massacre of 130 people by jihadists.
Brussels also reinstated its fireworks show after last year's was cancelled at the last minute due to a terrorist threat, with large crowds gathering in De Brouckere square.
In Stockholm crowds gathered on the north side of Södermalm to watch the fireworks over Djurgården.
In Copenhagen, the main gathering point was central Rådhuspladsen.
Rome stationed armoured vehicles and greater numbers of security forces around the Coliseum and St Peter's Square, where Pope Francis will celebrate a ""Te Deum"" hymn of thanksgiving.¨
At the Coliseum, thousands set off their own fireworks filling the air with smoke and sparkles.
In Barcelona, hundreds of thousands gathered in the city centre to ring in the New Year.
They were greeted with a fantastic fireworks display.
In Rome, earlier on Saturday, the pontiff held a mass at which he urged people to reflect on the plight of the young as the year drew to a close.
""We have created a culture that idolises youth... yet at the same time paradoxically we have condemned our young people to have no place in society,"" he said.
At the stroke of midnight, there will be a ""leap second"" decreed by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service to allow astronomical time to catch up with atomic clocks that have called the hour since 1967."

Airida Pettersen, who moved to Norway in 2008 after marrying a Norwegian man, is one of several hundred immigrants to have had their children taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service, or Barnevernet.
""I dress my daughter in a pretty dress and make her comb her hair,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Lithuania. ""They look at me like I'm from a Third World country. In my country if you don't take care of yourself you don't get a husband.""
She told AP that she had yet to receive an explanation from the CPS as to why her children were taken.
The children have now been reunited with their mother through the intervention of a relative and are now living in Lithuania's capital Vilnius
The child protection services in Stavanger, Norway did not comment of the specific case, but cited cultural differences when speaking to AP.
“Very many people come from other cultures with no government intervening in their domestic affairs. Then they come to Norway and the government intervenes in the family and they have no experience with this,” said Gunnar Toresen, head of the Child Protection Service in Stavanger.
Pettersen's case is not unique. According to the latest available statistics 6,737 children were taken into care in 2012, some 1,049 were immigrants or born to immigrant parents.
The actions of the Norwegian authorities have causes diplomatic disputes with a number of countries including India and Russia.
Czech president Miloš Zeman went as far as to compare Norway's foster care system to Nazi Germany's Lebensborn adoption system, expressing his anger at two Czech boys forcibly taken into care.
Norway's Minister for children and families Solveig Horne insists that Norway is acting in the best interest of children.
""There are some culture differences between families coming to Norway,"" Horne said.
""All children who come to Norway have the same rights as Norwegian children ... If they are neglected or abused or if there is violence in the family the (child protection) agency should protect the children first of all."""

					10:49 CET+01:00				",The Local,Norwegian fertility rate at historic low,"Longer educations and less certainty in the job market have pushed Norway's fertility rate to its lowest point in 35 years.
The Norwegian fertility rate has been on steadily declining for years and newly released figures from Statistic Norway (SSB) show that in 2015 Norwegian it bottomed out at an average of 1.73 children per woman.
The rate hasn't been that low since 1980.
The numbers are falling across the board, SSB researcher Trude Lappegård told broadcaster NRK.
“The fertility rate has decreased in all groups: among those with high educations, low educations, those in their 20s and those in their 30s,” she said.
Lappegård said that more and more Norwegian women aren't having as many children as they'd like because of “structural conditions in the society”.
She pointed to longer educations postponing first births for many women, while a tougher job market keeps the overall number of births down.
“More people are having difficulty getting a foothold in their careers. It looks like short-term work contracts and difficulties in obtaining a secure job are contributing to the decrease in the fertility rate,” Lappegård said.
Work conditions have also resulted in more Norwegians opting to stop growing their families after just one or two children.
“Large flocks of children and both parents in full-time jobs is viewed as a difficult combination,” the SSB researcher said.
Although Norway's fertility rate is at its lowest point in 35 years, it is still considered relatively high in a European context. According to Eurostat, the average fertility rate in the EU last year was 1.55 children per woman."
