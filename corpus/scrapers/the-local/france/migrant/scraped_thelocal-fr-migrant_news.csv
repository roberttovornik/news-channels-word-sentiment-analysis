					14:24 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'Irresponsible': France blasts Italy but defends not taking in stranded migrant ship,"French president Emmanuel Macron blasted Italy as ""cynical and irresponsible"" for refusing to offer safe harbour to the stranded migrant ship Aquarius, while the French government defended its own decision not to allow the ship to dock.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accused Italy of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" over its refusal to take in hundreds of migrants stranded on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean, a government spokesman said.
Macron told a cabinet meeting that under maritime law, ""in cases of distress, those with the closest coastline have a responsibility to respond,"" spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.
Earlier on Tuesday the French government defended its decision not to offer safe harbour to the stranded migrant ship Aquarius after local leaders on Corsica proposed opening one of their ports to the vessel.
Corsican leaders Gilles Simeoni and Jean-Guy Talamoni, the top politicians on the French Mediterranean island, tweeted their offer on Tuesday morning as uncertainty grew over the fate of the 629 people on board the ship.
But the central government in Paris criticised the gesture by the Corsican nationalists.
""[Simeoni] is taking a position without having any responsibility which is easy,"" junior Europe and foreign affairs minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne told Sud Radio.
""What does international law say? They need to go to the port that is safest and closest. And we can see that Corsica is not the closest or the safest. Given the boat's location, it is between Italy and Malta,"" he added.
Both Italy and fellow EU member Malta have refused to accept the migrants who are now heading for the Spanish port of Valencia after the new Socialist government in Madrid agreed to take them in.
Italy's hardline immigration policy under its new populist government could have knock-on effects in neighbouring France, where President Emmanuel Macron has also tightened immigration laws to crack down on illegal arrivals.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini -- who is also deputy prime minister -- has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of economic migrants, warning that Italy would not be ""Europe's refugee camp"".
The country has been the main point of entry in Europe for migrants and refugees arriving from Africa in recent years, with 700,000 crossing the Mediterranean since 2013, often from war-wracked Libya.

Italy policy 'sickening'
Any increase in arrivals in France would ring alarm bells for Macron who has worked hard to close down migration routes from Africa amid strong anti-immigration sentiment in France.
But a spokesman for Macron's Republic on the Move party said the Italian government's policy was ""sickening.""
""The position, the line of the Italian government is sickening. It's unacceptable to play politics with human lives which is what is happening at the moment,"" Gabriel Attal told the Public Senat channel.
""I'm a spokesman for the party, not the government, but I can't imagine that France will not play a role in finding a humanitarian solution for this boat,"" he said.
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen called for the boats to ""return where they came from"" and said charities rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean were ""the accomplices of the people-trafficking mafia.""
Eric Ciotti, a prominent hard-right MP from the opposition Republicans party, also called on the government to take a tough line on the Aquarius.
""No French port, not Corsica, not Nice, not Marseille,"" he told CNews.
""Of course we should save lives, naturally it's a priority and Europe must act. But the obvious solution is returning to the Tunisian coast or to the Libyan coast,"" he said.
French charity defiant
The head of the French charity which charters the Aquarius migrant rescue ship said Tuesday that it would continue its operations despite the international standoff over the 629 people currently onboard.
The defiant comments from Sophie Beau, head of the charity SOS Mediterranee, suggest the row over the stranded ship could repeat itself -- not least as migrant attempts to cross the Mediterranean increase in the warm summer months.
Beau told AFP a ""one-off solution"" had been found for the Aquarius after Spain offered to take in its passengers following refusals from the nearest countries, Italy and Malta.
But the charity's missions will continue ""as long as there are people drowning in the Mediterranean, as long as we have the resources, and as long as we are able to act and we are not kicked out of the area,"" she said.
""The rescues will continue and it is crucial that European countries talk amongst themselves to find acceptable solutions"" to bring to shore migrants stranded in the Mediterranean, she said.
Beau said her charity, based in the southern French port city of Marseille, was acting under international law in giving ""assistance to people in distress""."

					02:46 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Thousands gather across Europe to back migrant rescue ship stuck in Marseille port,"Thousands of people attended rallies Saturday across Europe to show support for migrant rescue ship Aquarius, stuck in port in the French city of Marseille after Panama revoked its flag.
Dozens of demonstrations were held in France including in Paris, as well as in Brussels, Berlin, Madrid and Palermo.
Many dressed in the boat's orange colours and chanted for ""a flag for Aquarius"" while slamming the ""criminal inaction"" of EU governments to resolve the impasse.
Marseille, home to the SOS Mediterranee NGO which operates the vessel with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), saw the largest show of support. Organisers said 10,000 people took part in the demonstration though police put the figure at nearer 3,500.
A similar rally in Paris also drew a crowd of around 10,000, according to the organisers, while police put the figure at a tenth as many.
""The goal is to make an appeal to citizens and show that SOS Mediterranee draws its legitimacy from civil society,"" said the NGO's spokeswoman Sophie Rahal in Paris.
Panama last month pulled the ship's flag following a request from Italy's far-right, anti-establishment government, meaning the Aquarius cannot legally set sail.
The boat's operators say it has rescued some 29,500 migrants to date and SOS Mediterranee president Francis Vallat said ""the situation is more critical than ever"".
Vallat said although migrant volumes had dropped ""we are passing from one death per 42 migrants (at sea) last year to one in 18 migrants"" this summer.
Attending the Marseille rally, French leftist champion, local lawmaker and leader of La France Insoumise Jean-Luc Melenchon insisted ""Aquarius must have a flag -- and a French flag"".
Meanwhile, around 100 flouted an official protest ban and gathered in the northern port of Calais -- where authorities in late 2016 dismantled the notorious Jungle refugee camp, which at its height at been home to some 10,000 migrants.
Immigration remains a hot-button issue in the European Union following the 2015 migration crisis. There are deep divisions among member states over how to handle the continent's biggest influx since World War 2.
Frontline state Italy has clamped down on asylum-seekers under far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
Saturday saw protesters gather in Riace -- a small hamlet in Italy's deep south which has earned praise for its integration of migrants -- demanding the release of their leftist mayor.
Domenico Lucano was placed under house arrest on Tuesday under suspicion of arranging ""marriages of convenience"" for immigrants and for allegedly skipping a tender process while awarding a garbage management contract to co-operatives with ties to migrants.
In office since 2004, Lucano has made headlines around the world for welcoming migrants to the sparsely-populated village in Calabria in a bid to boost jobs and development.
""Keep strong, continue fighting,"" his supporters chanted Saturday as they gathered outside his window from where he raised a fist in support."

After fleeing crisis-hit Libya by boat and making their way up Italy, the exhausted pair trudge in flimsy trainers along a pitch-black mountain trail in a night-time bid to reach France.
They are among hundreds of migrants trying their luck in Bardonecchia. The town is a skiers' delight, but beyond the black run thrills and hot toddies lie the tracks of those braving dangerous snowy peaks to cross the border.
After a crackdown at the Ventimiglia coastal crossing, young men have begun arriving at the railway station here to attempt the Col de l'Echelle pass, which runs 16 kilometres (ten miles) between Bardonecchia and the first French town.
While controls along this route are strict in the summer months, it is closed to traffic in winter and rather than zealous police the biggest challenge facing the mainly African men is a freezing wind that buffets the1,700 metre (5,600 feet) high pass.

Migrants from the Ivory Coast cross a snow-covered pass.
""Word has been spreading among migrants for several months. But it's extremely dangerous. The arrivals have become a daily tragedy!"" said local teacher Silvia Massara, who helps distribute hot meals to those passing through.
Inside the station, tired youths wolf down plates of stew and rice handed out by volunteers from the Rainbow for Africa and Briser les Frontieres associations, as well as the Red Cross.
Frostbite fears
Those lucky enough to make it to the French side without getting caught are welcomed by locals offering warm hearths and hearts. The Italians, meanwhile, do everything possible to convince the migrants to turn back before it is too late.
After surviving baking deserts, detention in Libyan prisons and perilous boat crossings in the Mediterranean, the migrants are shown pictures by volunteers of avalanches or fellow travellers who have lost limbs to frostbite.
Many shrug off the danger. ""We have nothing to lose. No job, no money, we are ready to take any necessary risk to cross the border,"" said one young Guinean, who wanted to remain anonymous.
Cyrille Coulibaly, a 20-year-old from Ivory Coast who recently arrived in Italy, had set off before dawn the day before, but quickly turned back, shivering violently in his lightweight clothing. However he refuses to be discouraged.
""I was advised to take this route. It's all planned. I just need to find some shoes,"" he told AFP.
Others, like 29-year-old Mohamed Bambore from Burkina Faso, throw in the towel before even setting out.
""I'm not going to do it. It's dangerous, you could lose a foot (to frostbite),"" he said.
French tourists offer food and water to migrants walking in the snow.
Instead he will wait in Italy for his residence permit to be renewed before looking for another way into France. Cisse and Ibrahim, struggling through snow up to their knees, their jeans soaked through, also turn back.
Dash in the dark
Catching a train would certainly be the easiest way: Bardonecchia is the last Italian stop on the Milan to Paris service, which runs four times a day. As night falls, the migrants put off by the mountain stare at the timetable, planning to sneak on at the next chance.
But reality catches up with them quickly, with seven or eight French border police officers on each train.
""The train is full, get the next bus,"" a conductor tells two young migrants, signalling for them to leave the station.
Italian police officers stand guard at the border.
The whistle blows, the doors close and the train leaves -- almost empty. Most of those who do make it across, by train or on foot, eventually find themselves in a white French police van which serves as a shuttle bus from six in the morning until midnight, returning them to Bardonecchia.
There are warm clothes and hot tea waiting for them at the station, where a little room has been transformed into a dormitory, in which exhausted travellers can bed down for the night under the supervision of a volunteer medic. Dawn brings fresh snowfall and new migrants, who determinedly zip up jackets, wrap scarves around their heads and brace for the climb up the menacing slopes.

					10:22 CEST+02:00				",The Local,French police admit taking two migrants over the Italian border 'by mistake',"French gendarmes have admitted driving two undocumented immigrants over the Italian border without Italy's permission, in what the French authorities said was a mistake.
The incident took place last Friday, when Italian police spotted a van belonging to their French counterparts near Claviere, a ski resort on the border between south-east France and north-west Italy that runs through the Alps.
The French officers reportedly ushered two men out of the vehicle into some nearby woodland, then drove back towards France.
Public prosecutors in Italy have opened an investigation into the incident, which was partly captured on camera by the Italian officers.
French authorities confirmed on Monday evening that a gendarme van had crossed the border during an operation to deport undocumented migrants. Officers alerted a police station on the Italian side, according to the Hautes-Alpes prefecture, but the vehicle was not supposed to enter Italy.
The gendarmes involved were new to the post and unfamiliar with the area, the French department's prefect Cécile Bigot-Dekeyzer told Le Dauphine, putting the incident down to ""an error on the part of the officers"".

The explanation failed to satisfy Italy's government, with anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini demanding ""clear, swift and unequivocal answers"" from Paris.
""I don't want to believe that [Emmanuel] Macron's France would use its own police to secretly unload immigrants in Italy,"" said Salvini, one of the French president's most vocal critics. ""But if anyone seriously thinks they can use us as Europe's refugee camp, violating laws, borders and agreements, they are sorely mistaken.""
It's not the first time the Alpine border has caused tension between France and Italy: in April, Rome summoned the French ambassador to complain after French customs officers crossed the border and confronted an Italian resident they suspected of carrying drugs at the train station of Bardonecchia.
The same month saw heated protests on both sides of the border by pro- and anti-migrant groups, prompting both countries to send police reinforcements to the mountain area.

Who is he?
Mamoudou Gassama is a 22-year-old undocumented immigrant who carried out a spectacular rescue of a four-year-old who was dangling from a balcony in Paris.
His act of bravery which took place at around 8 pm on Saturday in northern Paris, was captured on film and viewed millions of times on social networks.
Film of the rescue shows Gassama pulling himself up from balcony to balcony with his bare hands as a man on the fourth floor tries to hold on to the child by leaning across from a neighbouring balcony.
On reaching the fourth floor Gassama puts one leg over the balcony before reaching out with his right arm and grabbing the child.

Where's he from?
The actions were undoubtedly a staggering feat of courage but it was perhaps nothing compared to what he previously endured on his journey from his home country of Mali to France which saw him pass through war-torn Libya.
""I left Mali a long time ago, passing through Burkina-Faso and Nigeria,"" he told French news channel BFM TV. ""It was very difficult.""
Eventually Gassama arrived in Italy after taking a boat from Libya.
""It was terrible on the boat,"" he said. ""There were many of us, a lot of people.""
Gassama arrived in France in September 2017. He lives in a hostel in Montreuil, a suburb to the south west of Paris. He had travelled to the 18th arrondissement of Paris on Saturday and just happened to be by the building by chance after hearing all the commotion and people shouting.
What did he say about the rescue?
Tracked down by reporters 24 hours after the heroic rescue, Gassama said he had acted without thinking.
""I saw all these people shouting, and cars sounding their horns. I climbed up like that and, thank God, I saved the child,"" he said.
""I felt afraid when I saved the child... (when) we went into the living room, I started to shake, I could hardly stand up, I had to sit down,"" he added.

What has the reaction been in France?
Apart from the reaction on Twitter, where people have hailed his bravery, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo praised the young migrant on Twitter for his ""act of bravery"" as well as phoning him personally to ""thank him warmly"".
""He explained to me that he had arrived from Mali a few months ago dreaming of building his life here.
""I told him that his heroic act is an example to all citizens and that the city of Paris will obviously be very keen to support him in his efforts to settle in France,"" she added.
The young Malian will next be honoured for his brave rescue by French President Emmanuel Macron who invited him to the Elysee Palace on Monday morning (see below).
Diaby, Mamoudou's brother who was also interviewed on BFM TV said that they would bring up the subject of their status in France during their meeting with Macron.
""We would like to have a proper status here, to work in good conditions in France. Then as soon as you have a job you need housing, to have a good life,"" he said.
""Today he lives in a foyer (hostel), it is a very serious situation because there is no space, but we make do. Anyway, we make the most of the situation and ask.""
The act of bravery by an immigrant has also provoked a political row about immigration in France.
The act of heroism, which was the top news item for most French websites and television channels, comes as French lawmakers debate a controversial bill that would speed up the deportation of economic migrants and failed asylum-seekers.
Macron, a centrist, has taken a tough line on economic migrants fleeing poverty rather than refugees escaping war or persecution.
Plenty of people have been quick to point out to the likes of Marine Le Pen and those in her far right National Front party, exactly what immigrants can bring to France.
Those on the far right however have rubbished the idea that his Gassama's act of bravery should be used to distract from the migrant crisis in France.
A senior member of the anti-immigration National Front, Nicolas Bay, said however that while the party supported Gassama receiving French papers all other illegal migrants should be summarily deported.
But in a warning to other African migrants he said he ""can not give (papers) to all those who come from Mali or Burkina Faso"" -- two of the countries from where thousands of migrants set out each year for Europe on a perilous journey across the desert and Mediterranean Sea.
What did Macron do?
In his meeting with Macron on Monday, Gassama told the French president of his experience.
""I was trembling, I couldn't believe it,"" he said.
Macron asked what condition the child had been in once he'd been rescued.
""He was crying, his feet were hurt"" said Gassama, adding that he had seen the toddler since the incident.
""Bravo,"" replied the president.

And then the president announced that Gassama would be given French citizenship and would enroll in the French fire service.
""You have become an example because millions of people have seen you. It is only right that the nation be grateful,"" Macron told the 22-year-old, adding that his immigration status would be ""put in order.""
Confirming to Gassama that he would be made a French citizen, Macron said: ""Even if you did not think about what you were doing it was an act of courage and strength that won the admiration of all.""
During the meeting, Macron also proposed that Gassama, who received a medal and certificate for bravery, join the French fire service.

					09:12 CEST+02:00				",AFP,France says 'no' to Marseille-bound migrant rescue ship,"A new diplomatic row loomed Monday over the Aquarius as its operators announced the migrant rescue ship was heading to France, only for the French government to say it should dock at the nearest safe port instead.
The ship, the only charity-operated rescue boat working in the central Mediterranean, has been repeatedly turned away by Italy and been forced to stop in Malta and Spain after missions in recent months.
On Monday SOS Mediterranee, the charity which runs it, said its ""only option"" after picking up 58 migrants in its latest rescue was to head to the
southern French port of Marseille where the NGO is headquartered.
""We alerted other countries but we find it hard to imagine that France would refuse, given the humanitarian situation,"" said Francis Vallat, the head
of SOS Mediterranee's French operations.
But the French government appeared reluctant to welcome the boat -- which has become a bitter symbol of European divisions over migration -- to dock.
France wants the ship to disembark its latest passengers at ""the nearest safe port"" under ""a European solution"", the prime minister's office told AFP.
On Tuesday France's economy minister said Paris has turned down the boat's request to dock in Marseille.
""There are European rules. A boat with migrants on board must head to the closest European coastline. And the port of Marseille is not the closest. For the moment France has said 'no', because if we need to have a coherent policy on migration then we need to respect European rules.""
The Aquarius is currently near the Libyan coast, about four days from Marseille, according to Vallat.
The charity's director Frederic Penard told reporters that 58 migrants were onboard, including 17 women and 18 children.
Additional rescue operations might be carried out on the ship's voyage toward France, he added.
Flag at risk
The charity has refused calls by Italy and others to return the rescued migrants to Libya, saying the country -- riven by conflict between rival armed groups -- is not safe for refugees.
French President Emmanuel Macron has previously accused Italy of breaching international maritime law by turning away the Aquarius because the country is the closest to areas where the boat operates.
He was criticised at home for not offering safe haven to the Aquarius after it first became stranded in June, although France eventually offered asylum to about 80 rescued migrants.
His centrist government passed a controversial immigration law in August which it insists strikes a balance between granting faster asylum while allowing faster deportation of those rejected as ""economic"" migrants.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini accuses the Aquarius of offering a ""taxi service"" to Europe for migrants in Libya and has said it is permanently barred from Italian ports.
SOS Mediterranee and fellow charity Doctors without Borders (MSF), which operate the boat jointly, suffered a major setback Saturday when Panama said it would stop allowing the Aquarius to fly its flag at sea.
The decision came after Gibraltar withdrew authorisation for the Aquarius to use its flag in August, potentially leaving the boat stuck in legal limbo.
""We risk losing our Panama flag as soon as we reach land,"" Penard said."

The migrants saved by the Aquarius, run by French NGO SOS Méditerranée, were stuck on the overloaded ship for over 30 hours as Italy and Malta bickered over who should take them, before Spain stepped in and offered the port in Valencia as a place for the migrants to land in Europe.

He also said that in the five months to the end of May this year France had sent back to Italy 10,249 migrants who had crossed their common border.
""Our history of solidarity, humanity and welcoming spirit does not deserve to be criticized by members of the French government,"" he said.

The French foreign ministry responded that Paris was ""perfectly aware of the weight of migratory pressure on Italy and the efforts of this country"".
""Nothing said by France has questioned this, nor the need to coordinate closely among Europeans,"" a spokesperson said.
Italy's new populist government had earlier said that it would not ""accept hypocritical lessons from countries that have preferred to look the other way on immigration"".
""The Italian government has never abandoned the almost 700 people aboard the Aquarius,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. ""After the refusal of Malta to allow the people aboard the Aquarius to disembark there, we received an unprecedented gesture of solidarity from Spain. The same cannot be said of France, which has often adopted much more rigid and cynical immigration policies.""
Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) that makes up Italy's new government alongside the League, minister of labour and, with Salvini, joint deputy prime minister, said that it was ""embarrassing"" that France ""preached to us"" as Italy is asking its European partners to share duties with Italy.
""I'm pleased that they [France] have discovered responsibility. Let them open their ports and if they want we can send them a few people,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
But there was also criticism from Spain, despite its gesture of solidarity. Justice Minister Dolores Delgado said that Italy may have violated international humanitarian law, while Ximo Puig, president of the Valencia region, commented: ""Turning this into a political weapon is despicable... it is clear that Europe must act more wisely, but we cannot let these people die at sea.""

Italy's actions won praise, however, from the leaders of Hungary and Slovakia, two EU members that have fiercely resisted hosting asylum seekers.
""Finally!"" said Hungary's anti-immigration Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at a meeting with his Slovak counterpart Peter Pellegrini on Tuesday. ""We assure the Italian government of our complete support,"" he said, adding that he hoped Italy's stance ""can bring a change to Europe's migration policy"".
Yet Slovakia's premier insisted that ""we refuse to let migrants enter our country"", a stance that could bring him into conflict with Italy's new leaders, who have called for the automatic, compulsory resettlement of migrants across all EU countries.
The M5S-League government says that current EU rules, which require migrants to seek asylum wherever in Europe they first arrive, leave Italy and its southern neighbours bearing the brunt of mass migration across the Mediterranean.
It has found hardline allies in Germany and Austria, with the latter saying on Wednesday that the three governments aimed for ""very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe"".
The Aquarius is currently sailing for Valencia escorted by two Italian vessels, the Dattilo and Orione, which between them took on board more than 500 of the people rescued for the remainder of the 1,500-km journey after SOS Méditerranée said it was not safe for the Aquarius to continue unassisted.

					17:24 CET+01:00				",AFP,France unveils controversial migrant deportation bill ,"The French government defended a new immigration bill as ""completely balanced"" on Wednesday despite criticism from
rights groups and some ruling party lawmakers that it will lead to thousands of extra deportations.
The draft law, which criminalises illegal border crossings and speeds up procedures to deport economic migrants, was presented to the cabinet of President Emmanuel Macron for the first time.
It has sparked widespread anger from NGOs, who have branded it repressive, but the centrist government insists it is creating a more efficient system to sift out genuine refugees from those simply seeking a better life in France.
""It's a well-balanced law, in line with European law above all, and it is absolutely necessary that countries like Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden have the same type of procedures,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told a press conference.
More deportations
Macron, the 40-year-old centrist elected last May, says the new policy aims to balance ""efficiency"" with ""humanity"", but the issue has become one of the most divisive of his young presidency.
He has highlighted how the law would offer faster asylum procedures for refugees and improve their lives once accepted in France, but some members of his Republic on the Move (LREM) party have broken ranks.
The bill doubles the time that failed asylum seekers can be held in detention to 90 days -- a move aimed at making it easier to deport them -- and halves the amount of the time applicants have to mount appeals.
""The most vulnerable will be punished,"" warned Jean-Michel Clement, an MP who joined the LREM after switching from the Socialists.
Some workers at France's refugee protection office Ofpra went on strike in protest on Wednesday, branding the bill ""an unequivocal departure from France's tradition of asylum"".
They joined staff at the asylum court who have been on strike for nine days over their working conditions, with immigration lawyers also raising concerns over aspects of the draft law.
The bill will be introduced in parliament in April, with debate expected to last several weeks.
While leftwingers see it as too punitive, the right-wing opposition has labelled it too soft.
More French lessons
French voters consistently cite immigration as a top concern, and the issue helped far-right nationalist leader Marine Le Pen to win 34 percent of the vote in the presidential election last year.
Much of her rhetoric focused on the risk of France being ""swamped"" by foreigners from Africa.
""If we don't take on this problem, we will not be able to guarantee the right to asylum in France anymore,"" Collomb said at the press conference.
The country received a record 100,000 asylum applications last year and offered refugee status to around 30,000 people, official figures show. Forced expulsions numbered 14,900.
NGOs have lashed out in particular at the tougher conditions for failed asylum seekers.
""We're asking for it to be withdrawn,"" the Cimade migrants' charity said of the bill.
""We're not even in favour of fighting for changes to the bill, because the philosophy behind it is just too repressive.""
The government said it is also considering proposals on how to better integrate newcomers, including doubling the number of hours of French lessons they get and allowing asylum seekers to work.
The bill also aims to cut the average waiting time on asylum applications from 11 months to six, although staff at the asylum court have raised concerns that the tighter turnaround on cases will make it more difficult to appeal.
A heated parliamentary debate last week on a separate law on taking in ""Dublin"" migrants -- those whose asylum claims are registered in other EU countries -- provided a window on how the issue has split Macron backers.
The government has already had to abandon a controversial proposal to deport failed asylum-seekers to third countries deemed ""safe"".
Plans by Collomb to carry out immigration checks in homeless shelters have also come under fire in recent weeks.
Left-wing Liberation newspaper noted that while polls showed voters backing tougher immigration laws, the relocation of thousands of migrants to towns and villages nationwide in 2016 went off largely without a hitch.
""The French say they are worried, wary and want conservative migration policies. But once they get to know refugees they also want them to be welcomed,"" the paper wrote in an editorial."

The Aquarius picked up 141 people on Friday in two separate operations, SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders said on Twitter.
The Aquarius ""remains in the search and rescue zone, and on the lookout for any other craft in distress"".
In one of Friday's operations the Aquarius took on board 116 people, including 67 unaccompanied minors, mostly from Somalia and Eritrea.
Their wooden boat was overloaded and carried neither water nor food when it was spotted some 24 nautical miles off the Libyan coast, north of Abu Kammash.
Earlier the same day, the vessel had already rescued 25 migrants who were travelling in a small wooden craft, also off the Libyan coast, north of Zouara.
This marks the return of the vessel after a diplomatic spat that began in the night of June 9-10 when the Aquarius, having picked up 630 stranded migrants including children and pregnant women, was refused access to docks in Malta and then Italy.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini later threatened to turn away any migrant rescue boats, sparking a fresh row among the EU's 28 members over how to handle the influx of people fleeing war and poverty.
After the ship was stranded at sea for days, the new Socialist Spanish government offered to let it land at Valencia, where its passengers disembarked on June 17."

The Aquarius, chartered by French aid group SOS Mediterranee, was due to leave the southern port of Marseille later Wednesday nearly two months after Italy and Malta refused to let it dock with 630 migrants onboard, sparking a bitter international row who would take them in.
""Nothing except a threat to the security of our ship... will make us give up our triple mission: saving, protecting, bearing witness,"" the NGO's chief Francis Vallat told a press conference.
The ship has been docked for a month for maintenance work following the row, which saw Italy's populist government insist it had had enough of NGOs dropping rescued migrants on its shores.
After being stranded at sea for days, the migrants onboard the Aquarius were eventually allowed to dock in Spain.
The crisis prompted EU leaders to seek a compromise deal at a summit meeting in late June, which could lead to ""disembarkation platforms"" outside
the bloc, most likely in north Africa, to discourage migrants boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.
SOS Mediterranee says it has a humanitarian duty to prevent migrants -- mostly sub-Saharan Africans -- from drowning as they attempt the perilous Mediterranean crossing in rickety boats.
The group has picked up nearly 30,000 people since it launched its rescue operations in February 2016. Over the past four years, at least 15,000 people have drowned trying to make the journey, it said in a statement.
While docked, the ship has re-stocked with food and improved its sanitary facilities, including better waste treatment to prevent diseases spreading onboard.
In recent weeks Spain has overtaken Italy as the top European destination for migrant crossings, with close to 23,000 arrivals this year.
The European Commission is set to give Spain tens of millions of euros in emergency aid to cope with the influx from Morocco, a European source told AFP on Wednesday."

On Friday, it picked up 141 people in two separate operations, half of them children, but it has again struggled to find a port to bring them ashore.
Sophie Beau, president of the vessel's operator SOS Mediterranee, said the ship, which is currently situated between Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa, had again received ""official negative replies"" from the two countries.

The St Martin Canal is near the site of a sprawling former camp by the Stalingrad Metro stop, which was cleared only to spring up again several times
last year.
This is the second operation of its kind to happen in just a few days, with the biggest migrant camp in the French capital evacuated last Wednesday.
This was known as the ""Millenaire"" or Millennium camp and was home to around 1,700 mainly Sudanese, Somali and Eritrean migrants.
The migrants were to be housed temporarily at more than 20 sites across the Paris region while the authorities checked their identities, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said in a statement.
The Local reported the announcement on May 24th from France's Interior Ministry that thousands of migrants living in camps along stretches of canal in Paris were set to be moved out ""quickly"" in the 35th evacuation to have taken place in the French capital since summer 2015.
Around 2,300 migrants have been living in makeshift camps along the canals in the north east of the French capital for months.

Two camps have been growing for several months in the north east of Paris, especially in the northern Villette area -- where some 1,600 people live in alarming conditions.
An additional 600 people, mainly Afghans, are sleeping in a tent city along the trendy Canal Saint-Martin, where the recent drowning of a migrant increased concerns over the camps.
Migrants camped along the Canal Saint Martin recently told The Local of the squalid conditions they are living in as aid groups called on authorities to address ever-worsening situation, which they say will lead to security and health risks.
Abdul Jabar, 24, from Afghanistan has only been in France for the past five days, but his journey from Afghanistan took him 6 months.
He travelled from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Iran to Turkey to Bulgaria to Serbia, and then hopped on a truck to France.
“It's very bad here. I have no bed no food and no shower and it's very cold at night,"" said Jabar who says his parents encouraged him to make the journey and ask for asylum.
When asked if he regrets the journey though, he says no. “Here there are no bombs.” Jabar says he seeks schooling, work, and a better life in France.
In July 2017, Paris police moved out 2,500 migrants who had been living rough in the north of the city.

					09:05 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Migrant row between France and Italy caps a history of prickly relations,"A war of words between France and Italy over migrants has set the scene for a testy European summit this week after the latest spat between neighbours who have had complicated relations for centuries.
Emmanuel Macron's rocky relationship with Italy's ruling populists worsened this weekend when far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini blasted the French president's ""arrogant"" stance on immigration.
Salvini further accused Macron of hypocrisy for criticising his hardline approach while France continues to ""push back women, children and men"" across the border back into Italy.
Macron, who argues that France has taken in more asylum seekers than Italy this year as the massive influx across the Mediterranean has slowed, hit back: ""We won't take lessons from anyone.""
The heated exchange overshadowed a weekend meeting in Brussels that was supposed to find better ways to handle the hundreds of thousands arriving from Africa, the Middle East and Asia since 2015. European leaders are set to meet on Thursday and Friday in Brussels to discuss the issue as well as eurozone reforms.

Macron was perhaps destined to get on badly with Salvini after coming to power in an election that pitched his pro-EU centrism against the far-right populism of Marine Le Pen.
He won no friends in Rome last week by likening anti-migrant sentiment to ""leprosy"", and compounded the row by suggesting that with arrival numbers down, Italy did not have a migrant crisis but a political one. He had already attracted Italy's ire by criticising its refusal to take in 630 migrants onboard the Aquarius rescue ship, and a Franco-Spanish proposal for ""closed"" migrant camps in arrival countries went down similarly badly.
France's ambassador to Rome was summoned this month over the row, and while Macron is heading to the Vatican Tuesday to meet Pope Francis, he is not stopping in Rome to meet Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
""The political leaders of Italy and France have not treated each other this badly since they were at war,"" Aldo Cazzullo observed in the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
From Napoleon to Libya
Analysts say the chill reflects not just a clash of political worldviews but a long history of animosity.
The 20th century saw times of both bitter enmity during World War II and close cooperation as the neighbours worked together to build the EU afterwards.
Gilles Bertrand, co-author of a history of Franco-Italian relations since 1660, sees traces of centuries-old invasions by European powers, including France under Napoleon Bonaparte, in contemporary suspicions.
""Even though they are extremely close culturally, with ties going back to the Middle Ages -- commercial, intellectual, artistic -- it goes down badly when France acts superior,"" said Bertrand, a professor of modern history at the University of Grenoble Alpes.

More recently, resentment brimmed over the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya -- a former Italian colony -- which was heavily backed by France.
""The Italians are hugely sensitive when it comes to Libya,"" said Jean-Pierre Darnis, a lecturer at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis who specialises in Franco-Italian relations. ""Their reading of it is that in 2011 France intervened in Libya to dislodge them"" in their former sphere of influence, he told AFP.
Italy also views Libya's current lawlessness -- a driving force in the migrant exodus from the North African country -- as the direct result of the intervention, an additional source of anger, he said.
The bombing campaign was before Macron's time, but soon after his arrival in power last year he aggravated tensions over Libya again by organising a spontaneous peace conference independently of Italy.

'Economic colonialism'
The last few years have also seen growing tensions between the neighbours over investment projects.
French companies invested heavily in Italy in the 1990s and 2000s, including luxury group LVMH's acquisition of the Fendi label in 2001 and Bulgari a decade later.
Yet the value of French takeovers since 2000 has been more than five times higher of the value of Italian takeovers in France, according to financial analysts Dealogic -- leading to regular accusations of ""economic colonialism"".
On this front, again, Macron's presidency got off to a bad start -- he temporarily nationalised the STX shipyard instead of giving a majority stake to Italy's Fincantieri, reneging on an agreement between Rome and the previous French government.
A face-saving deal was eventually worked out to hand the Italian shipbuilder 50 percent of STX, ""but it did a huge amount of damage,"" said Darnis.
""It wiped out pretty much all of Macron's political capital in Italy,"" he added.

The disused hospital earmarked for the project was firebombed, some 250 residents staged a protest and NGO workers assisting the group of Afghans had their car tyres slashed.
""At first people said we were terrorists... and that we were going to give hash to the children (in the school next door),"" said Asif Qaderi, 23, who was part of the first group bussed to the leafy town 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of Paris.
But the fears expressed in the town of 4,000 -- of home break-ins and girls at the school next to the centre being harassed -- came to nought.
The 91 men, who had been sleeping on the streets of Paris, instead devoted their energy to restoring the neglected building, pursuing their asylum claims and learning French, guided by the Emmaus Solidarite housing charity.
They also raised chickens and sheep, dug a vegetable garden, built a football field and held barbecues that helped break the ice with the community.

'Caught in the middle'
But the centre is now being closed -- a symbol of opposition in many parts of France, where 60 percent of people interviewed in a June poll said the country had ""too many"" migrants.
Local mayor Marie Lespert-Chabrier, who made the state promise to move the Afghans on after two years, is still smarting at being forced to take the foreigners in, leaving her ""caught in the middle"" between youths fleeing war and misery and a hostile population.
While admitting that the fears of the refuseniks proved unfounded, she is adamant that her town has done its bit for the migrants who have poured into Europe in the past three years.
France, which registered a record 100,000 asylum-seekers last year, received far fewer migrants than the likes of Germany or Sweden, with police regularly turning people back to their EU port of arrival -- usually Italy.
Once in France, most head for the streets of Paris or Calais in the north, a jumping-off point for Britain.

Forges-les-Bains was one of dozens of towns selected to host migrants as part of a major relocation programme in 2016.
To Ahmadzi Gul, 19, it felt like a second home.
""Forges is a bit like a village in Afghanistan. It's quiet and the people are nice,"" Gul, who was scarred by police violence on the migrant route in Bulgaria, said as he hoisted his belongings onto a truck bound for a shelter 30 kilometres away.
""We regret having to leave,"" said Emmaus Solidarite's head Bruno Morel, for whom the centre demonstrated ""that you can welcome migrants in a dignified manner, without causing any problems"".
No 'misty-eyed idealists'
A five-minute drive from Forges-les-Bains lies a town about half its size that has been hailed as a model of tolerance.
Bonnelles led the way in 2015 when it agreed to give 78 Syrian and Iraqi men shelter in a monastery.
With TV images at the time showing clashes between migrants and police at the Hungarian border, ""there was a lot of concern"" among residents, recalled the town's mayor of the last 23 years, Guy Poupart.
While calling on residents to show solidarity, he took care to neither demonize nor deify the newcomers.

""These are humans, some of whom fled for their lives or lost loved ones.
But we did not take sides nor become misty-eyed idealists,"" he said.
That approach paid off, with the monastery going on to host some 550 asylum-seekers for short periods -- on average 90 young men of 14 different nationalities at any one time -- nearly all of whom praised by residents as engaging and polite.
""Nothing has changed, we don't see the refugees much,"" said Sophie Derouin, co-owner of a hair salon, who had to brush up her school English to tend to new Afghan clients.
But even in Bonnelles, where migrants and local youths have struck up friendships around football and at least one asylum-seeker found work with a local company, some residents still oppose the foreigners' presence.
""That's enough. We have enough problems with our own homeless,"" Derouin's business partner Isabelle Bobinet said, a sentiment echoed by Patrick Cassert,
owner of a cafe on the main street.
Caring for asylum-seekers ""is costing France too much money,"" he said."

					12:27 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Paris: Hundreds of migrant children 'left homeless due to flawed process',"Hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children are being left to sleep on the streets of Paris due to a flawed age assessment system, a new report reveals.
The study, released on Wednesday, by rights charity Human Rights Watch showed that child protection authorities in the French capital are using flawed procedures to determine the age of vulnerable migrant children leaving many with no choice but to sleep on the streets.
The practices, which often lead to children being wrongly categorised as adults, mean that they are considered ""ineligible for emergency shelter and other protection given to children"", the report, entitled ""'Like a Lottery': Arbitrary Treatment of Unaccompanied Migrant Children in Paris"" said.
The shocking revelations made by the study included the fact that children are often turned away by protection authorities ""based on appearance alone"" while others found themselves rejected after interviews ""lasting as little as five minutes"" which is against French regulations.
“These children have suffered through incredibly difficult and dangerous journeys, only to be deprived of the protection and care they need,” said Bénédicte Jeannerod, France director at Human Rights Watch.

“Deeply flawed procedures mean that children may be arbitrarily turned away at the door of the evaluation office, denied protection after a short interview, or tied up in arduous court procedures and left in limbo for months.”
In order to produce the report, the charity interviewed 49 unaccompanied children and took into account age assessments in an additional 35 cases.
On top of that, Human Rights Watch spoke with lawyers, health care providers, staff and volunteers of humanitarian agencies and informal associations, and government officials in France.
One of the problems, according to the report, is that young people are often denied interviews if they cannot provide identity papers and even those that have them may be rejected, with the authorities doubting their validity.
Imrane O., a 15-year-old from Cote d'Ivoire who received an interview said he was turned away on the grounds that his French was ""too good"".
The examiner “said that I was answering her questions too well. Because I could answer her questions, I couldn’t be a minor. How is that? I did eight years of schooling, in French. Of course I could answer her questions.”
The news comes at a time when the number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving in Paris, as well as in France overall, is increasing.
In 2017, France’s child welfare system took more than 25,000 unaccompanied migrant children into care, representing an increase of 92 percent from the previous year.
In February 2018, when Human Rights Watch began this research, an estimated 400 unaccompanied children were sleeping rough in the French capital, according to estimates from lawyers and nongovernmental organizations."

Around 1,600 migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, have constructed makeshift shelters under an overpass in the northern Villette area -- one of the largest camps in the French capital since the surge in arrivals to Europe beginning in 2015.
An additional 600 people, mainly Afghans, are sleeping in a tent city along the trendy Canal Saint-Martin.
In summer the banks of the Canal St Martin are usually packed with young revellers enjoying a drink and picnic by the water but now the tents stretch down the towpaths from Jaures Metro, until the metal fences which have been erected to prevent the camp spreading.
The tents along one side of the canal are mostly occupied by Afghans, while on the other side there are mostly Africans from Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Mauritania and Cote d’ivoire.
Empty water bottles and debris scattered around.
Abdul Jabar, 24, from Afghanistan has only been in France for the past five days, but his journey from Afghanistan took him 6 months.
He travelled from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Iran to Turkey to Bulgaria to Serbia, and then hopped on a truck to France.
“It’s very bad here. I have no bed no food and no shower and it’s very cold at night,"" said Jabar who says his parents encouraged him to make the journey and ask for asylum.
When asked if he regrets the journey though, he says no. “Here there are no bombs.” Jabar says he seeks schooling, work, and a better life in France
Samsour, aged 19 and also from Afghanistan has been in France for the past three months after travelling through Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Hungary, and finally Germany where his demand for asylum was rejected.
His asylum demand was also rejected in France and he now plans on going to Calais to try his chances in England.
'I regret coming here everyday'
Samsour says all he can do is continue trying. He wants to write a book about his story.
Sierra, a 19-year-old from Senegal has been in France for the past 3 months after travelling through Mali, Algeria, Libya and Italy.
“You call the asylum offices, but agents don’t take your call. I keep trying but the lines are always occupied.”
He says that even when they accept someone’s request for asylum, such as the case for his friend, you’re not given housing, and are left to live by the canal.
“I left after my parents died. I tried living with my aunt but there were too many family problems,” he said.
Sierra thought he would come to France and continue his studies in law.
“I regret coming here now. Not just sometimes, everyday I regret it. I sleep on the floor. At least back home I had a little roof over my head,"" he said.
“I saw on television that France was this country of fraternity and liberty, but I come here and I’m left to this camp where there is always fighting and problems.
A fight broke out between an Afghan and some of the Africans after a member of the public began handing out food. Each group accused the other of taking too much food or keeping it to sell on later.
'Unlike any we've ever seen in Paris'
Louis Barda of Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) said this week that ""the situation is increasingly alarming,"", calling the Villette camp ""unlike any we've ever seen in Paris"".
While two doctors nearby were treating patients as others washed their clothes in the nearby canal, a young man suddenly began convulsing, AFP witnessed on a visit to the camp.
The seizures stopped a few minutes later, but the man was muttering gibberish with a panicked look on his face. He refused to go along with first
responders for treatment.
""He probably took some drugs,"" Barda said, adding that he and his colleagues had noted ""more and more addictions"" at the site.
Tensions ""have clearly gotten worse over the past two weeks,"" he said, citing people who have needed treatment ""after being hit with iron bars, people with gaping wounds, knife cuts"".
On Sunday a Sudanese man was seriously injured during a fight, while a young Afghan drowned in the Canal Saint-Martin last week.
Another migrant's body was also fished out of the canal near the ""Millenaire"" camp at La Villette (see pic below).
Meanwhile volunteers are grappling with an outbreak of respiratory and skin conditions such as scabies in the squalid, tightly packed camps.
""The security and health of the people living in these camps, but also of members of aid associations and local residents, are no longer assured,"" according to a petition signed by more than 30 aid groups, released Thursday.
'Knife in the stomach'
""I've been here about two weeks,"" said Ahmad at the Millenaire camp. ""It's so difficult, at night it's so cold, no good food, no washing -- it's a terrible time.""
""Three or two days ago I saw one person, someone hit him with a knife in the stomach,"" he said.
Aid groups say the camps have attracted smugglers from the port city of Calais, offering them a chance to reach Britain -- where many migrants believe it would be easier to find work and potentially asylum.
But ""if you want go to England you have to pay 1,000 euros ($1,180). It's too expensive!"" said Beniam, a 26-year-old Eritrean, who says he prefers France because of its ""schools and jobs"".
""Their days are reduced to finding food, toothpaste or soap, to washing their clothes. They're stuck in these camps and unable to imagine anything else,"" said Alix of the NGO Utopia 56, declining to give her full name.
""What's happening here is also because the state isn't accepting its responsibilities, so citizens and associations have to pick up the slack,"" she said.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has called on the government of President Emmanuel Macron to find shelter for the migrants, only to be told that unless she wants government forces to evacuate the site, the problem is hers.
The impasse has led to a series of calls for urgent action, with senior Paris priest Benoist de Sinety denouncing ""a total absence of humanity"".
""If you let the camp get bigger, you're leaving them exposed to smugglers,"" said Barda of Medecins du Monde.
""They'll do their deals and maintain the trafficking, fuelling all the tensions we're seeing today.""

Police believe the man in his twenties fell from a shack he had been staying in on some sort of ledge above the road near the town of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.
He was barefoot when he was found and was in a sleeping bag on the side of the road. An autopsy is due to be carried out to determine the cause of death.
Police found a diary in which he recounted his daily life and the lengthy trip that had taken him from his home country to Europe, written in English, among his affairs, local media reported.
The death came less than a week after a 15-year-old Afghan migrant died after apparently being hit by a car on a road near Calais in the north of France.
Another migrant, an Iraqi national, is in a critical state after he was hit by a car on a motorway on Christmas Eve near the port of Dunkirk.
At least 15 migrants have died in southern France since September 2015, according to a count kept by AFP news agency.
The latest victim there likely came via the Italian border town of Ventimiglia, which has become a launching pad for migrants who make it to Italy and seek to head north into France.
Increased border patrols have made it much harder for them to do so, so many are now braving the snow-clad Alps further north in efforts to evade immigration police and reach France from Italy.
They often take treacherous high-altitude passes that locals warn will lead to deaths.

The migrants have typically been refused asylum in Italy, and want to try their luck in France -- although under the so-called Dublin Regulation, France has the right to send them back across the border.
Until recently it was relatively easy to cross into France thanks to the unmanned border between the two countries.
But monitoring has tightened as the volume of arrivals has grown in recent years.

And French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed that his government will be ""inflexible"" in its policy of expelling economic migrants who have no right to asylum.
Macron's centrist government has promised to open up new legal avenues for refugees to travel to France, while cracking down on others who are in France to avoid poverty back home, rather than war or persecution.
""We can't take all of the world's misery,"" Macron has said."

It may worsen as warmer weather approaches.
President Emmanuel Macron is seeking to centralise France's response to an influx of migrants in recent years as part of a new immigration bill being debated in parliament this week.
A migrant camp, mainly home to Afghans, has been spreading along the Canal Saint-Martin in recent months, and has now swelled to some 800 people.
Another 1,500 people, mostly Eritreans and Sudanese, have converged under an overpass on the Canal St Denis further to the north.
And the arrival of warmer weather could quickly swell their ranks, as seen at previous camps that have been dismantled in the capital in recent years.

""If nothing is done, in two weeks there will be 3,000,"" Hidalgo told AFP, adding that she had asked the central government to find shelter but had so
far ""not had a response"".
The greater Paris region currently has room to shelter just 750 migrants, many of whom hope for refugee status but may be facing expulsion under Macron's tougher approach.
Some have arrived in Paris from the northern port of Calais, where migrants have flocked for years hoping to stow away on trucks to Britain.
Officials in the area have deployed a heavy police presence to ensure that no more camps like the huge ""Jungle"" site that was razed in 2016 are set up.
The Local spoke to migrants at the Canal Saint Martin at Christmas time. Many were teenagers and had imagined something very different when they had imagined France.
“Teachers in school taught us about France and what a wonderful place it was,” said Khater, who said he was 15 years old, as he stood by the dozens of tents strung along the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin that now serve as home for hundreds of migrants.
“I didn't think it would be like this,” he said, surveying the squalid scene along the canal, whose banks in summer host hundreds of trendy youngsters drinking beer or wine late into the night.
On Wednesday, UN human rights experts deplored an ""inhumane situation"" in Calais and elsewhere in northern France, urging the government to provide
water and emergency shelters.
""We are concerned about increasingly regressive migration policies and the inhumane and substandard conditions suffered by migrants,"" the UN's special
rapporteur on migrant rights, Felipe Gonzalez Morales, said in a statement from Geneva.
The government's draft law criminalises illegal border crossings and speeds up procedures to deport economic migrants, while offering faster asylum
procedures.
But several NGOs and other critics say the new laws will lead to thousands of deportations, and the government has already abandoned a proposal to deport
failed asylum-seekers to third countries deemed ""safe"".
France received a record 100,000 asylum applications last year and offered refugee status to around 30,000 people, official figures show. Forced
expulsions numbered 14,900.
""We're lying to the French by saying this is a temporary crisis that we'll fix with an immigration law,"" Hidalgo said.
""Let's be practical: Find shelter for the people sleeping in the camps, and then we can look at their situations,"" she said."

His body was found as the regional train arrived early on Sunday morning in Menton, in the south of France, its first stop after Ventimiglia station in Italy.
Police suspect that the man climbed on top of the train to make the 15-minute journey across the border and may have grabbed hold of an overhead electric line to avoid being thrown off.

It is the fifth such incident on the cross-border train line in a year, according to Ansa, most recently in August. Four people died of their injuries, while one was rescued.

The Aquarius, run by French charity SOS Mediterranee, was eventually allowed to dock in Spain on Sunday after being stranded for days while both Italy and Malta refused to let the migrants ashore.
Local leaders on the French island of Corsica had offered to welcome the Aquarius, but the move was slapped down by the central government, which argued that under international law the ship had to dock at the closest port.

Tensions flared after President Emmanuel Macron accused Rome of ""irresponsibility"", although he later said he had not meant to offend France's southern neighbour.
Macron is under pressure to close down migration routes from Africa amid strong anti-immigration sentiment in his country.
France has said it will examine asylum requests from Aquarius migrants who want to come over from Spain on a ""case-by-case basis"", government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said Sunday, although he did not know how many might make the requests.

port of Dunkirk ""as soon as possible"" after clashes at the site.
The population of the Grande-Synthe camp has swelled to about 1,400 to 1,500 people since the destruction last October of the squalid ""Jungle"" camp near Calais, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away.
""It's no longer just a question of re-establishing public order"" in the camp, Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux told a hearing at the French Senate.
France will proceed with a ""progressive dismantling of the camp which should start as soon as possible,"" he said, adding that ""we can't let things continue like this.""
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, with French authorities repeatedly tearing down camps in the region.
The decision has angered the charities that have provided aid to migrants in the area.
Sue Jex, Head of UK Operations for refugee support charity Care4Calais, said: “We are appalled that the desperately needed shelter for refugees in Grande-Synthe will be dismantled, following the demolition of the nearby Calais Jungle last year.
""We have all seen the terrible consequences of the demolition of the Jungle – this pushed many of the vulnerable refugees arriving in the north of France into living conditions far worse than those in the Jungle ever were.
""They are now faced with unsafe, unsanitary, and undignified conditions, many sleeping rough because they have nowhere else to go.""
The Grande-Synthe camp, populated mostly by Kurds at present, was built by the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to house migrants and refugees who otherwise sleep in tents or makeshift shelters.
They gather along the northern coast in France seeking to break into trucks heading to Britain or pay smugglers to help them get across the Channel.
Police intervened at the camp after five men were injured in a fight at the start of the month. Another man was stabbed in November.
Several thousands of people from the Jungle were sent to accommodation around France last October, leading to fierce criticism from the far-right National Front party and other groups.
The Socialist government, which is determined to try to stop another camp from springing up in Calais, has criticised Britain for reneging on a deal to resettle hundreds of underage migrants from the camp."

The ""Nowhere but Out"" report comes amid tensions between France and Italy over French President Emmanuel Macron's criticism of Rome over its rejection of a migrant ship carrying 629 people rescued from the Mediterranean.
Oxfam said some 16,500 refugees and migrants -- a quarter of them unaccompanied children -- passed through Ventimiglia, a small town about seven kilometres (four miles) from the French border, in the nine months to April.
The report said children complained about being ""physically and verbally abused, and detained overnight in cells without food, water or blankets and with no access to an official guardian,"" all contrary to French and EU law.
Oxfam staff and partners said there were cases where border guards cut the soles of the shoes of child migrants or stole their phone SIM cards.
""In one case, a very young Eritrean girl was forced to walk back across the border along a road with no pavement carrying her 40-day-old baby,"" it said.
Most of the migrants were fleeing persecution and war in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan.
Many of them are trying to reach other countries like France, Britain, Sweden and Germany where they hope to join relatives or friends.
""Since France tightened border controls in 2015, thousands of people have been stranded in Ventimiglia without sufficient assistance or access to basic services,"" Oxfam said.
""Hundreds of refugees and other migrants sleep rough under a flyover, with no access to drinkable water, shelter or heating.""
'Pushed us off the train'
""French police officers are not upholding international standards. They taunt children and mistreat them.... Some children have had the soles of their
shoes cut off before being sent back to Italy,"" said Chiara Romagno, Oxfam's OpenEurope project leader in Ventimiglia.
""The resolution of people to reach their loved ones in other countries, and the lack of sufficient safe and regular pathways to do so leaves them no choice but to try until they succeed,"" Romagno said.
Michael, a 15-year-old from Sudan's troubled Darfur region, said he and a friend tried to enter France but the ""police pushed us off the train.
""Then they pushed us in a van in the railway station car park. We were given a document (refus d'entree, refusal of entry) in the van and we were put on another train going back to Italy, without any explanation.""
The report said Roja Camp, the official camp set up outside Ventimiglia, was vastly overstretched and that the ""heavy police presence at the entrance and compulsory fingerprinting deter many from staying"" there.
Most migrants preferred to live rough, sleeping under a motorway outside town with no sanitation facilities or clean water.
""In Ventimiglia, there are no arrangements to take care of the returned children. Once off the train, they are left to fend for themselves,"" the report said.
Oxfam said France should immediately stop and adequately sanction the ""illegal practices of the French police at the French-Italian border"", ensure the right to seek asylum for all foreign children in French territory and take care of them according to the provisions of national, European and other international laws.
An EU scheme to distribute migrants equitably around the bloc has failed miserably, with central European members flatly refusing the quotas and others, including France, falling far short of their allocated target.
Italy has received more than 700,000 migrants and refugees since 2013.
Many West Africans try to continue on to France, where they speak the language and often have relatives, only to find the border shut to them.

They are among dozens who have been tricked in recent weeks into paying hundreds of euros to people traffickers who promised them a comfortable car ride across the border.
The Montgenevre Pass isn't steep, but the snow is deep, and the young men's trainers and jeans do nothing to protect them against the biting minus 10 C (14 F) chill.
If they get lost, it might take hours to cross -- long enough to freeze to death.
By the time members of the French volunteer group Tous Migrants (We Are All Migrants) come to their rescue in the black of night, the youths are broken.
""I haven't slept for four nights, I can't take it anymore,"" says Abdul, a tall, thin Malian teenager, who trembles uncontrollably throughout the 40-minute car journey to the shelter run by Tous Migrants in the mountain town of Briancon.
Thousands of young men from francophone west Africa have trudged across these mountains over the past two years, dreaming of jobs in France.
In recent months, as news about the route filters back to Africa, the arrivals have gained pace.

Since July, nearly 3,000 have passed through the modest shelter run by Tous Migrants where volunteers distribute hot meals, dry clothes and a mattress to bunk down on.
But recently both the migrants and the volunteers have found themselves at the mercy of a new phenomenon: smugglers based in northern Italy who dump migrants -- including, on occasion, mothers with babies -- in the Alps, leaving them to fend for themselves.
The smugglers, who are also French-speaking west Africans, charge up to 350 euros ($430) to sneak people into France.
But once the group reaches the Italian border village of Claviere by train and bus, the car that is supposed to carry them on the last leg of their journey to Paris never materialises.
The smugglers instead call the French volunteers to notify them that a group of Africans is heading their way -- and then turn on their heels.
'You trust them blindly'
Realising they've been duped -- sometimes by fellow nationals -- is yet another humiliation for the youths, after a harrowing journey across the desert, through Libya, and over the Mediterranean in rickety boats that often
sink.
""You trust them blindly,"" said a 26-year-old from Cameroon, who asked to be called Steve to protect his identity, in shock after having to cross the mountain with his eight-year-old son.
Steve handed over the 250 euros he earned picking fruit in Sicily to a smuggler who abandoned his group of 20 in Claviere.
They waited for four hours in the cold, ""until we couldn't feel our feet any more"", before eventually setting off, ill-equipped and with barely any idea of where they were going.

The rescuers are angry at the idea that their well-intentioned efforts may be greasing the migrant smuggling machine -- and their phone numbers are sometimes sold as part of the ""package"" offered to migrants.
""Our mission is to rescue people who are in danger on the mountain, not to act as a taxi for traffickers,"" said Philippe Wyon, one of around a dozen volunteers who regularly carries out mountain rescue missions.
Tous Migrants reluctantly decided in mid-February not to answer smugglers' phone calls any more, worried about inadvertently breaking the law if found to be cooperating with criminal gangs.
Instead, they've been carrying out ad hoc search operations on the mountain, hoping simply to bump into migrants so they can bring them to safety.
In failure, dishonour
Most of those crossing the Alps in recent months have been from Guinea or Ivory Coast, both former French colonies.
Few have any hope of being granted refugee status, being considered economic migrants for fleeing a crippling lack of jobs and opportunities at home rather than war.
But that message has been slow to filter through -- partly because those who make it through do not want others to know how much they suffered and those who get deported keep a low profile.
Failure to make it ""spells tragedy for these young people,"" Ivorian sociologist Fahiraman Rodrigue Kone, author of a report on returning migrants, told AFP, adding: ""It's seen as a sort of social death and a dishonour"".

At 16, Cellou has already seen a lifetime of suffering. The Guinean teenager was kidnapped, imprisoned and abused by armed Libyan gangs over the course of his long voyage to France.
""I came here to study and train as a chef. I love cooking!"" he says.
Some, like Ibrahim, have already had their dreams dashed.
The 22-year-old Guinean was left paralysed down one side of his body after plunging 40 metres (130 feet) while attempting to cross a mountain pass in August and has been in several hospitals ever since.
He has a message for west African parents who pack off their sons to make their fortune in Europe: ""This journey, these mountains, are too dangerous.

He was buried under several tonnes of paper rolls bound for a British customer after the driver lost control of the truck and it overturned, regional security officials said.
Last week, an Afghan migrant died after being run over on the road leading to the port.
The number of fatalities has however fallen dramatically since 2016 when 14 migrants died while trying to reach Britain - a popular destination for Afghans and east Africans particularly.
Migrant numbers in Calais have dwindled to a trickle after the authorities late last year bulldozed a settlement on the outskirts of the port where thousands of people had been sheltering and bussed them to shelters around the country.
Since then the police has relentlessly pursued young Africans and Asians who try to set up camp in the area, drawing sharp criticism from rights groups.
At the other end of France, attempts by migrants to get into the country from Italy have also led to fatalities.

In July he promised to find temporary shelter for all those on the streets by the end of 2017 - a goal he looks nearly certain to miss, with many still sleeping rough around the country."

It comes after officers have been criticised for their mistreatment of refugees.
The police officer's defense claimed the incident was an involuntary gesture against an agitated person.
However the court in the Northern city of Boulogne-sur-Mer saw the incident which took place in a detention center near Calais in the summer of 2016 differently, handing him a six-month prison sentence.
The 40-year-old officer, who was a member of France's border police (PAF), slapped the migrant just before he was due to appear before a judge in a trial room at a detention center in Coquelles.

The officer slapped the migrant in the presence of a court clerk who then testified against him.
However his defense presented a somewhat different version of the story.
""It was an unfortunate act of protection, he did not want to slap,"" said his lawyer Antoine Deguines. ""This person was quite agitated, and was getting up all the time, and on the spur of the moment he [the officer] stretched his arm which went in the person's face.""
The judgement against the officer, who has also been banned from holding a weapon for five years and suspended from performing public office for two years, comes at a time when the treatment of migrants and refugees by French border police is under scrutiny.
A report conducted by the French state and released at the end of October said that it was “plausible” that police and gendarmes have abused their powers and mistreated migrants and refugees in Calais.
And in July, rights group Human Rights Watch blasted French police for their routine use of pepper spray against migrants in Calais in a report entitled ""Like living in hell"".
Of 61 migrants questioned by the prominent international human rights group between the end of June and the beginning of July, 55 said they had been sprayed during the two weeks before the interview, and some said they had been sprayed every day, the author of the report, Michael Garcia Bochenek, told AFP at the time

Some 350 men, women and children, most of them Iraqi Kurds, had been living for weeks in squalid conditions in the wood on the edge of the town of Grande-Synthe.
Hundreds of police were brought in to dismantle the camp as its residents were packed onto buses, bound for migrant centres in 10 different regions across France.
""At the last count there were 56 children present and around 40 women. I can't let this situation go on anymore,"" local mayor Damien Careme told AFP on Monday before the operation.
Grand Synthe lies 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the port city of Calais, where authorities dismantled the sprawling ""Jungle"" camp -- which at its height was home to 10,000 people -- in late 2016.
Over the objections of the central government, Careme had opened a refugee camp in Grande-Synthe that met international standards in early 2016.
But the camp, where 1,500 people had been sheltered, was destroyed in a huge fire that broke out in April after a brawl involving hundreds of Afghans and Kurds.
Careme went up against the government again more recently when he proposed setting up new facilities for migrants on the site of the burned-down camp to allow them to live in more dignified conditions.
But Paris categorically opposed the move, with the interior ministry saying Monday that this ""would only encourage"" migrants seeking to head to Britain, potentially leading to another large-scale camp.
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, causing tension between the two neighbours.
Though the Jungle camp has been cleared, hundreds of people are believed to remain in the Calais area seeking to break into Britain-bound trucks or pay smugglers to help them get across the Channel.
Migrants have been encouraged to register asylum applications in France, but many are determined to travel to Britain for family, language or work reasons.
Another nearby camp, at Norrent-Fontes, was cleared of its 85 residents on Monday. They were taken to migrant centres in the region."

The activists, part of the ""Tous Migrants"" association, took part in a solidarity march of 100 activists escorting some 20 migrants over an Alpine pass last April.
They were responding to a blockade set up at a nearby mountain pass by several dozen far-right activists from Generation Identitaire (Identity
Generation) who were seeking to keep the migrants out.
""My conscience is clear, I have nothing to feel guilty about"", said Benoit, one of the three men summoned along with a woman by police in Briancon, southeast France.
""The concept of fraternity has no borders"", he told journalists Tuesday before entering the police station, where about 100 of the group's supporters
had gathered.
Three other activists are already on trial in the case, though a judge has delayed hearings until November pending a ruling by France's top
Constitutional Council on legislation covering aid to migrants.
Earlier this month the council ruled that people could not be charged for helping migrants who entered the country illegally, a victory for activists
who denounced prosecutions of what they called ""crimes of solidarity"".
But even though the council codified the ""principle of fraternity,"" individuals can still be charged if suspected of actively helping migrants
cross into France illegally.
In the wake of the decision, a French court last week ordered charges dropped against a 73-year-old Amnesty International volunteer who helped two
underage Africans enter the country.
The cases come as the government of President Emmanuel Macron is pushing through parliament a tough new immigration law which would speed up the asylum process and accelerate deportations."

					16:06 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Calais migrants use tiny boats to cross Channel,"Thwarted at every turn in their efforts to reach Britain, migrants in northern France have once again changed
tack, turning to flimsy dinghies to carry them across the Channel.
Migrants in Calais have sneaked into trucks or trains, and even tried to walk through the undersea tunnel in increasingly risky -- and sometimes deadly -- attempts to reach Britain.
However tighter security has stymied these efforts and authorities have reported about a dozen operations to rescue migrants drifting in inflatable dinghies in the Channel since the start of the year. In 2015, there were none.
The most recent rescue took place on June 11, when three Iranian migrants were saved from their sinking vessel. Four days early, three other migrants were rescued in similar circumstances.
Pierre-Joachim Antona, spokesman for the local French maritime authority, said efforts to cross the Channel by boat were ""no longer extraordinary or isolated"".
There have been rare cases in recent years of migrants drowning while trying to swim across the narrow sea, and an Afghan once built a raft with a bedsheet in a failed effort to drift to England.
But the phenomenon is now a ""real and lasting trend"", said Antona.
Hundreds of thousands of economic migrants and refugees have crossed from Turkey to Greece in overloaded boats SINCE , hundreds of them perishing in the process.
While France's migrant crisis is tiny compared to that faced by Greece or Germany, the slum-like Calais camp of about 4,000 migrants desperate to reach Britain is a political hot potato on both sides of the Channel.
Many of the migrants have relatives in Britain, or believe they will have a better chance of finding employment there.
The migrants' main tactic has been sneaking onto the back of trucks, initially when drivers stopped to rest and later by blocking roads and forcing their way onto the vehicles.
The crisis reached a peak in July and August last year when hundreds tried to storm the Eurotunnel site on several consecutive nights to try cross the Channel.
Security was stepped up in response to the disturbances, however recent efforts to block traffic flared again last month.
At least 26 people have been killed attempting to reach Britain since June 2015.
Antona said it had become ""nearly impossible"" for migrants to make it through the tunnel, forcing them to adapt their tactics.
He said that while coastguards had intercepted several boats, there was evidence that some were succeeding in crossing the treacherous stretch of water.
""We are realistic, we know there have been other attempts, successful or not,"" said Antona, citing ""clues on English and French beaches, like small boats or life vests.""
""When the weather is good you can see England from the French coast and, quite naively, one could imagine the crossing will be quick and easy but it is an absolute illusion,"" he added. ""It is one of the most dangerous seas in the world.""
High levels of traffic, strong currents and cold water mean chances of surviving a crossing are flimsy.
""The risk of a boat not being seen by a large cargo ship and being run over are enormous,"" said Antona.
Both France and Britain have stepped up patrols and efforts on land to curb the trend.
Patricio Martin, director of the border police in northern France, said a surveillance system had been set up along the coastline to ""intercept smuggling networks even before the migrants take to the sea"".
A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that smugglers were demanding ""up to 10,000 euros ($11,300)"" for the crossing.
Antona said that the smuggler would provide a small boat, sometimes with life jackets and a telephone to call for help if needed.
""These are very fragile vessels, completely unsuited for this kind of crossing. Some don't even have engines and the migrants have to row,"" said Bernard Barron, head of sea rescue charity SNSM in Calais.
However there were also professional smugglers using larger, sturdier vessels that can carry up to 20 people, he said.
In May, 18 Albanian migrants were rescued from a rigid-hulled inflatable boat when the boat started to take on water. Two British smugglers who were also on board were charged over the attempted crossing."

As French authorities prepare to raze the Calais ""Jungle"" camp and move thousands of migrants to shelters nationwide, two towns a few kilometres apart in the countryside near Paris reveal a nation torn between fear and fraternity.
In Forges-les-Bains, a town whose thermal baths once welcomed arthritic Parisians, 44 Afghan men received a frosty reception on their arrival last week to a disused hospital transformed into a migrant shelter.
Five days after they moved in, a group of around 250 protesters (see photo below), some waving French flags, marched through town to denounce the ""imposition"" of the shelter by the Socialist government.
""The state forced this centre on us but I for one don't intend to put up and shut up,"" said Lea, a young mother, as she pushed her toddler son down the street.
(AFP)
The town of 3,700 people is one of a handful where unease over immigration, stoked by a string of jihadist attacks and inflammatory rhetoric from right-wing politicians, has led to attacks on migrant shelters in recent weeks.
A gaping hole in the roof of one building revealed the damage (see photo below) wrought by opponents who had tried to set the shelter alight before the Afghans arrived.
In the past week shots have been fired at two other shelters set to receive migrants -- one in western France, another in the southeast.
(AFP)
Most of the opposition has been in small towns which complain they were presented with a fait accompli by a state scrambling before winter to find accommodation for the migrants from the squalid makeshift camp in Calais -- mainly Sudanese, Afghans, Eritreans and Pakistanis according to NGOS working there.
""A project imposed equals increased anger,"" read a banner held aloft by demonstrators in Forges-les-Bains, who have demanded a moratorium on new arrivals at the centre.
With a further 47 migrants bound for the town in the coming weeks, the stage is set for a showdown.
The government is looking to move up to 12,000 migrants out of overstretched Calais and also Paris by the end of the year.
The numbers represent a fraction of the 80,000 asylum applicants France expects to receive this year -- itself a drop in the ocean compared with the nearly 900,000 received by Germany last year.
But with immigration a hot topic in next year's presidential and parliamentary elections the right-wing opposition has come out all guns blazing.
The interim leader of former president Nicolas Sarkozy's Republicans party, Laurent Wauquiez, accused the government of creating Calais-style ""jungles all over the country"".
(Protests in Montpellier by far right groups. AFP))
Single men
The parents leading resistance to the shelter in Forges-les-Bains bristle at being tarred intolerant.
""We're not against migrants. We would have happily taken families,"" said Valerie Rigal, a midwife, echoing concerns expressed by many residents over the presence of a shelter for a group of single men 100 metres (yards) from a school.
One mother who did not wish to be named feared ""incidents like those in Germany"", referring to the rash of sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve, blamed mainly on North African men.
But a symbolic vote organised by the mayor showed opposition to migrants going beyond such fears, with 59 percent of respondents against taking in any migrants, families included.
""I'd rather we support our own homeless,"" said Audrey Guibert, a councillor from the far-right National Front (FN), who was among the demonstrators.
Worlds apart
A year ago, a different France was on display when a first group of refugees, mainly from the war-torn Middle East, arrived from Germany under a faltering plan to distribute the migrants pouring into Europe among EU member states.
The mayor of Bonnelles, a town of around 2,000 people eight kilometres (five miles) from Forges-les-Bains, was swamped with donations when 78 Syrian and Iraqi men landed in a monastery on the edge of his leafy village.
""From the start it went well. Everyone rolled up their sleeves,"" Guy Poupart said.
Since then scores of migrants have passed through the monastery where they get a bed, food and lessons in French language and culture.
""They're very polite. They always say 'bonjour Madame',"" Christelle, owner of a bakery on the main Rue de la Liberation (Freedom Street), said.
Ghafur Rahmani, a 26-year-old who fled Afghanistan's volatile Herat province, said a year in Bonnelles had helped fill the educational void left by his country's perennial wars.
""I learned to read and write here. I love France,"" he said, pausing for breath during a fast-paced football game between Afghans, Pakistanis, Sudanese and local youths.
'Burst this myth'
Over 3,000 asylum-seekers have already been moved to the provinces in the past year, with little fanfare and fuss.
Bruno Morel, director general of Emmaus Solidarite, the housing charity in charge of the shelter in Forges-les-Bains, attributed the sudden circling of the wagons to newfound fears about a ""mythical violent migrant.""
""We have to bust this myth,"" he said, warning that France, long a haven for people fleeing war and persecution, would be ""turning its back on its history if it is not capable of welcoming people with a little kindness and humanity.""
Watching the demonstration in Forges-les-Bains reprovingly, Jennifer Sandalian, a young mother of two, agreed.
""We all have a role to play in welcoming migrants,"" she said. ""We have to show them another image of France."""

Around 500 have people died off the Libyan coast in the first quarter of 2018, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The pair aim to ""cover a rectangle stretching 150 kilometres from East to West, 50 kilometres north of Tripoli, the area with the highest concentration of rescues and boat sinkings"" José Benavente told Le Monde.
""The NGO boats urgently need assistance locating dinghys and signalling them to the MRCC (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre), the official Italian organisation which coordinates rescues,"" he said.
Micolon, a former Boeing 747 pilot, and Benavente met in flying school in 2006. They founded a charity Pilotes Volontaires (Voluntary Pilotes) in January to help people in trouble at sea.
The pair had originally hoped to crowdfund the money for their plane, but realised it would take too long.
Fuentes said: “It would have taken too much time. Spring is here, boats are starting to leave Tripoli again. When the humanitarian agency SOS-Mediterranée explained that they were having to rescue canoes from the waves already, we realised that we could be useful immediately.”
The duo’s plane is equipped with an automatic pilot so the pair can keep their eyes on the sea to search for stricken boats.
It can fly for 10 hours before needing to refuel.
The plane also has a satellite communication system to allow it to speak to humanitarian agencies.

But why don't they want to stay in France? The Local went to Calais to find out why.
'El Dorado' is frequently used by the French press to describe the lure the UK holds for the migrants waiting in the northern French port city of Calais for their illicit and dangerous chance to cross the English Channel.
The name implies an illusion and false hope and raises the question of why the migrants don't just apply for asylum in France, which in theory would give them access to healthcare, financial aid, accommodation and possibly legal assistance for their application.
The Local talked to dozens of migrants living in the camps in search of answers.
SEE ALSO: Calais migrants: A daily struggle to get to Britain
It appears many of the some 2,000 migrants living in filthy squats and squalid camps in Calais desperately hoping to get to the UK, have reached the same conclusion: they feel they are not welcome in France.
They point to racism from locals, the months-long wait for government papers, the harsh existence in muddy, medieval camps and living off one meal handout per day.
“They don’t want us to stay. France doesn’t like immigrants,” Nebi Kifrom, 22, of Eritrea told The Local. “If you ask for asylum they will say to us come back in three, four months. What am I supposed to do until then?”
Another question is where will they live.
Matthieu Tardis, from France Terre D’Asile, a charity which provides “legal and social services” to asylum seekers and refugees in France told The Local recently that France has accommodation to cater for 22, 000 asylum seekers, but they had 65,000 applicants last year.
""The problem is becoming more and more serious,"" he said.
Because most of the migrants in Calais are without money or much hope of outside help, they want to find work immediately. It’s one of the primary factors propelling them out of France.
They are aware of France’s record unemployment numbers (the 6.2 percent rate in the UK is four percentage points less than in France) and poor economic prospects.
SEE ALSO: France rejects four out of five asylum seekers
“There is no work here, too many problems,” said Sofi Hann, 24, who comes from a region that straddles Afghanistan and Pakistan. “I’m going to America, but I have to get to England first.”
The language and perceptions about working papers are the next most important obstacles in the minds of migrants.
'At least the Italians try to speak to you'
As the migrants come from Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, if they speak a western language it’s most likely to be English and not French. They know their prospects of finding work - or even managing daily life -- are poor without basic French.
“Even if they know English they don’t want to speak it,” Ibrahim Adam, 30, of Sudan said of his interactions with some French locals. “They understand what I am asking but they prefer to answer in French. At least the Italians try to speak to you.”
Also the migrants need papers to allow them to legally stay and work in France. But it can take months to get a preliminary appointment to apply for asylum.
The famously difficult bureaucracy in France, which even the French admit is unwieldly and needs reform, is no kinder to desperate migrants than it is to anyone else.
“They give you an appointment in maybe eight months. In the meantime you have to stay in these conditions,” said Adam, the 22-year-old Sudanese migrant, speaking near the foul smelling outdoor toilets at a squat in Calais.
“Then they give you a paper and tell you to come back in three months.”

'They feel as though they are not welcome in France'
Even though Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has vowed to send workers out into the field to try to convince migrants to build a life in France, most migrants told The Local they’d never seen anybody from the government.
While migrants wait an average of two years for a decision they are not legally permitted to work most of that time. Instead they are reliant on a €336 per month allowance from the French government, which may not seem much, but is significantly more than the €185.90 monthly payment in the UK.
However, for most migrants in Calais the thought of government aid is a distant and abstract thought. The hand outs of clothes, cans of food and tents, for those lucky enough to have them, come from charity groups or sympathetic citizens.
“For them this is life in France,” said Ibrahim Adam, 30, from Sudan. “They feel as though they are not welcome.”
As he spoke to The Local, Adam, stood in a muddy field that was home for some 100 migrants living in tents and cooking over small campfires. Cruelly, it sits behind a caravan dealership with full of unoccupied mobile homes and camping cars.
The migrants also said there were darker currents among the locals besides reticence in using English. Some reported overt racism like people shouting insults out of their car windows while driving past or run-ins with angry men on the street.
“I don’t think they like to see black people,” Anwar Kedir, 20, of Ethiopia said. “A man was shouting at me to go home. He said ‘We don’t want you.’”
He added: “I asked to live in France, but the country doesn’t want me. How can I stay here?”
'England or die trying'
Many like-minded migrants believe their only option is the illegal and occasionally deadly journey stowed away in trucks that head across the Channel to a country where they’re convinced applications are processed faster and work is easier to find.
They see the prospect of dying from carbon monoxide poisoning or being run over by a truck on the trip across the water as a risk they are willing to take.

The extreme-right group Generation Identitaire (Generation Identity), the youth branch of the nativist Bloc Identitaire movement, which describes its mission as “defending the identity of France and Europe” had launched an appeal to raise funds in early May.
Their aim was to “charter a boat and sail in to the Mediterranean to thwart NGO ships” that regularly save stranded migrants trying to make it across the sea to Europe.
The group claimed it would help any migrants they came across who were in distress before returning them to the African coastline.
The operation named “Defend Europe” that was backed by other far-right identitarian groups around Europe had raised around €65,000 in contributions, €15,000 more than its initial target.
But the campaign did not go unnoticed and web users began to kick up a fuss online, notably urging the internet payment site PayPal, through which the funds were being collected, to block the group’s account.
An online petition was also launched calling for a ban on such fundraising.
The Twitter hashtag #StopDefendEuropePayPal was launched and calls were made to boycott the system.
The pressure eventually took its toll and PayPal reacted by blocking contributions to the Generation Identitaire account.
PayPal’s statement to the Rue89 news website read: “Our policy is to prevent our services being used by companies whose activities promote hatred, violence or racial intolerance.”
Generation Identitaire told the site that their account had been blocked but they would be able to recuperate a part of the contributions.
The group, which has clashed with police during anti-migrant protests at the French-Italian border (see pics below), has planned to carry on and intends to open another fund on another website.
Generation Identitaire caused anger in the northern town of Lille last year when authorities allowed them to open a bar called The Citadel in the city centre.

Migrant ship, Aquarius. Photo: AFP
The plight of the Aquarius rescue ship has shone a light on the failure of EU members to band together in the face of an unprecedented influx of migrants arriving across the Mediterranean since 2015.
Under EU rules, migrants must apply for asylum in the European country where they first arrive, putting pressure on Italy and Greece, the main entry points for people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
An EU scheme to distribute migrants equitably around the bloc has failed miserably, with central European members flatly refusing the quotas and others, including France, falling far short of their allocated target.
On Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hailed cooperation between the hardline interior ministers of Austria, Germany and Italy on the question of migrants.
""We believe an axis of the willing is needed to fight illegal migration,"" he said.
More than 700,000 migrants have landed in Italy since 2013.
Many West Africans have continued on to France, only to be sent back to Italy to have their asylum claims processed there.

The last evacuation of the Porte de la Chapelle camp took place in early July, when around 2,500 people were transported to alternative locations. These included school sports halls which were empty over the summer holidays.
Before that, a police operation in May had moved around 1,000 people out of the makeshift tent camp where they had been living in squalid conditions. Earlier in the year, city authorities had installed large boulders under the flyover in an attempt to dissuade groups from settling there.

Amid an ongoing row over unauthorized crossings of the two countries' remote Alpine border, unnamed sources in Rome told the Italian press on Tuesday that an investigation was underway into whether gendarmes sought to drive underage migrants into Italy.
The incident allegedly took place on the night of October 18th, around a week after Italian police said they spotted French officers driving two men across the border near the ski resort of Claviere. Authorities in France admitted to the earlier incident, which they put down to a ""mistake"".
That explanation will be less convincing if Italy can prove that the same thing happened more than once. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who styles himself as French President Emmanuel Macron's biggest critic, insists that similar incidents have recurred for several months and has shared what he claimed to be video evidence on his Facebook page.

Salvini, head of the anti-immigration League party, has insisted on sending police reinforcements to Claviere since reports of unauthorized deportations first broke. He said that he would order a permanent guard post to be established on the Italian side to watch for any attempted pushbacks in future.
""What's coming out from Claviere just confirms that, when it comes to human rights, no one can preach to Italy,"" Salvini railed.

In an interview with Le Parisien daily published Sunday, Collomb said he would push to modify the Touquet accords signed in 2003, which effectively moved Britain's border with France to the French side of the Channel.
""I hope to add a new element to these agreements, and concrete measures regarding the coverage of certain costs by the British and the management of more people, for receiving refugees and unaccompanied minors,"" he said.
His comments come as President Emmanuel Macron is to visit Calais on Tuesday, ahead of a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London on Thursday.
Hundreds of migrants are stilled massed near Calais more than a year after the huge so-called Jungle camp was cleared by the authorities in October 2016.
Collomb said about 400 people are now in the area, compared with more than 7,000 a year ago, and defended the government's efforts to find shelter and process asylum requests.
""The ones sleeping outside don't want to present themselves, because they don't want to seek asylum in France,"" he said.
The government said last week that asylum claims hit a record 100,000 in France last year, and Collomb said an additional 85,000 people were refused entry at France's borders.
""It's impossible to adequately take in 185,000 people each year: that's a city the size of Rennes,"" he said, referring to the Breton capital in northwestern France.

					09:14 CET+01:00				",The Local,Paris opens its first humanitarian migrant camp,"An official migrant centre in Paris will welcome its first occupants on Thursday, just a week after French police cleared thousands of refugees off the streets of the capital.
After two and half months of building, the official ""humanitarian"" Paris migrant camp and reception centre will open its doors on Thursday.
The new camp is located in a disused hangar, near Porte de la Chapelle, to the north of the city near Gare du Nord.
It will act as an official reception centre for migrants - mainly single men - who have just arrived in Paris. Women and children will be taken straight to specific accommodation.
""The idea is to create a place where every newly arrived migrant can be welcomed and offered dignified, humane shelter,"" said Bruno Morel, head of the Emmaus Solidarite charity running the centre.
However it will not provide long term lodgings, with occupants only able to stay for a maximum of 10 days, after which the migrants will be moved on to specific accommodation designated for asylum seekers.
During their 10 days, they will be given access to help in processing their asylum applications, as well as food and medical care – “the things that are impossible to do when migrants are living on the street,” said Morel.
A giant 900-square-metre inflatable structure (see photo), has been erected as an area of orientation,where migrants can get information and advice, access to translators as well as help on returning home voluntarily.
In the converted hangar, authorities have built eight ""villages"" for 50 people, with each ""room"" having four beds. In all some 120 people will be employed at the site, along with 500 volunteers. It has been built at a cost of €16.4 million.
Authorities hope the camp will put an end to the squalid makeshift settlements that regularly spring up in the city.
The camp however has a capacity of 400, 80 new arrivals a day - well below the kind of numbers who have been sleeping rough in make shift camps in Paris in the last two years.
Only last week police cleared 3,800 migrants from their tents in the north east of the city.
“We are not naive. This centre will not solve everything,” said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. “But we finally have a worthy and humane alternative to the street settlements.
Plans to create a ""humanitarian"" refugee camp in Paris were first announced back in May by Hidalgo.
Another Paris camp designated for women and children will also open in Ivry-sur-Seine to the south of the city at the beginning of 2017.
Last month, authorities also demolished the notorious ""Jungle"" shantytown in the northern port of Calais -- the main launchpad for attempts to smuggle across the Channel to Britain.
France's Socialist government is anxious to show it has a handle on migration in the run-up to presidential and parliamentary elections next year."

					10:27 CEST+02:00				",Ben McPartland,Migrant crisis won't end with Calais 'Jungle' closure,"France began the massive clearance of the Jungle migrant camp in Calais on Monday morning, but with thousands of refugees still desperate to reach the UK, what will happen now?
France hopes the clearance of the squalid Jungle migrant camp in Calais will close a sorry chapter in the country’s migrant crisis, but it is unlikely to be the end of the story.
And what chance of a happy ending?
On the day of the clearance there was an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 migrants in the Jungle camp. At around 8.45am the first bus pulled away carrying around 50 Sudanese refugees to a reception centre in Burgundy.
Over the next three to four days scores of buses will take the thousands of other refugees to some 450 reception centres across France.
Some migrants say they are refusing to budge hence the presence of scores of baton-wielding police. But many also predict a significant number of those who have been bused to Burgundy and beyond will simply make their way back to Calais once the riot police and the journalists have moved on.
""After a week everyone will be back to create a new Jungle. We just don't know where yet,"" one young migrant told BFM TV on Monday.
How many will head back to Calais?
A wall, stretching one kilometre long and four metres high is currently being built along a stretch of the motorway leading to the port that passes by the Jungle camp. Britain would not have agreed to pay for its construction if authorities really believed the clearing of the Jungle would end the crisis in Calais.
Charities and aid associations say many of those who have been moved out of Calais in previous months, have only returned to the northern port town, so there is no reason to believe anything will be different after this week's official clearance.
They simply refuse to give up on their dream of reaching the UK and Calais, where thousands of lorries that cross to the UK via boat or the Channel Tunnel will remain the best place to risk their lives in the hope of crossing.
Much too will depend on what services are on offer to migrants in the small towns around France.

No translators, no friends
“They find themselves in a department of France where there are no real translators,” Anne-Lise Coury, head of operations for Medecins sans Frontieres in Calais, told The Local recently.
“They can end up far from a town and the administrative offices they need,” said Coury.
“They may be also far from places where they can learn French, or from members of their community,” she added. “And they end up just deciding to go back to Calais.”
The reception they receive will also play a role. The build up to Monday's clearance has seen several reception centres attacked by arsonists and one was sprayed with bullets. And locals in some towns have held anti-migrant protests.
But there have also been pro-migrant protests and much support offered to new arrivals.

While the government insists Calais' migrants crisis is France's problem, the reality is many concerned people in towns across the country, not least the far-right mayor of Beziers, would rather it was just a conundrum for Calais.
(The humanitarian Grande Synthe camp near Dunkirk. AFP)
More camps around the area?
There is also evidence that migrants will just set up other smaller camps around the Calais region or head to another more established shanty town like The Grande Synthe, near Dunkirk.
A Syrian migrant named Sam told AFP that ""dozens"" had left the Jungle early to avoid being sent elsewhere in France.
""I have been in the Jungle for 13 months and during this time I have learnt not to trust the authorities. So last night I left the Jungle and pitched my tent in another place nearby,"" about a dozen kilometres away, he said.
There has been growing evidence that people traffickers have been targeting UK-bound lorries in motorway rest areas well before they reach Calais. The A1 motorway north may soon be dotted with mini-Jungles at strategic points where traffickers believe they can get migrants on board the lorries.
There are also fears that the closure of the Calais camp will just shift the crisis to other ports along the northern French and Belgian coast.
Other Channel ports to come under pressure?
After the closure of the southern part of the Jungle earlier this year, there were reports that the number of attempted illegal ferry crossings at ports such as Ouistreham and Dieppe rose dramatically.
But with the Jungle being completely dismantled the shift could be even greater this time and French authorities and the UK might have to start strengthening security and building four-metre high fences at other Channel ports.
For many migrants however the clearance of the camp could be positive. London says it is willing to take in scores of unaccompanied refugee children. Some have already arrived while others be shipped or put on a train to the UK in the coming days.
And for the many who do want to stay?
Hundreds of migrants headed to Calais in recent months just to be there for the official evacuation.
They are the ones who have decided that being moved to a reception centre in rural France is better than risking their lives each night to get to the UK.
“Anywhere in France would be better than the Jungle”, said one Sudanese migrant on Monday as he boarded a bus to Burgundy.
Aid associations say a growing number of migrants have decided to seek asylum in France.
Pascal Brice, head of the Ofpra asylum agency, said his staff were trying to convince migrants that their asylum requests in France would be processed ""very quickly"".
Around 70 percent of migrants evicted from other camps in Calais in the past had been given French residency, he said.
And what will become of those migrants who are given asylum? For them the task of learning French and trying to find work and permanent lodging won’t be easy in a country with record unemployment and not a great record of successfully integrating immigrants.
But charities are doing their best to help them, as seen by the open-air French lessons in Paris.
The challenge of settling in France is one that many will gratefully accept given what they have already gone through to get here.

					14:14 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"France must build more migrant centres, rights watchdog says","France should create more reception centres for migrants to ensure decent conditions as arrivals pick up pace in the summer months, the head of an independent rights watchdog said on Friday.
Former government minister Jacques Toubon, the head of the Defenseur des Droits (Protector of Rights) body, made the claim as he visited a humanitarian centre for migrants in the La Chapelle area of northern Paris.
More than 2,800 people were evacuated earlier this month from a makeshift camp that sprung up around the centre, but a new camp is already forming.
French authorities have cleared makeshift migrant tent camps in Paris more than 30 times since 2015.
President Emmanuel Macron's government last week announced plans to create more than 12,000 places in reception centres for asylum seekers and refugees by 2019.
The numbers of refugees and migrants converging on Paris has increased since the closure last October of the sprawling migrant camp in the northern French port of Calais known as the ""Jungle"".
Thousands of migrants had made their home in the Calais camp in the hope of stowing away on trucks crossing the Channel to Britain.
READ ALSO: France jails Britons for smuggling migrants into England
French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb ruled out re-opening a migrant centre in Calais, saying it could act as an encouragement for migrants to head for France.
Toubon took issue with the minister's ""false"" claim.
""Everything shows that migration is the necessity to flee one's country and the political situation there, or war, flooding, drought, famine, or the denial of rights to women and homosexuals... there is no magnet effect in operation here.""
Toubon said that as soon as migrants enter France ""their fundamental rights must be guaranteed"".
Europe's migrant influx began in 2015, focused on Greece where hundreds of thousands of people crossed from Turkey as they fled war and poverty in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
The crisis receded in 2016 under an agreement with Turkey to clamp down on illegal border crossings.
However, it revived this year, focusing instead on sea crossings from Libya to Italy, mostly by people from sub-Saharan Africa."

The treaty, set to be announced at a summit in London on Thursday, will ""complete the Le Touquet accord"", Macron's office said in reference to a 2003 deal that effectively put Britain's border in northern France.
The details are ""still being finalised"", the French presidency said, but the treaty will include measures on how to manage unaccompanied minors, and Britain will make a ""major"" financial contribution.
At stake during Thursday's talks is a 2003 agreement between Britain and France which effectively moved the UK border onto French territory, meaning the area around Calais has become a bottleneck where migrants heading for Britain wait.
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb reiterated Tuesday that France would ask Britain to take in more refugees from northern France and increase their funding -- not only for security measures, but also for the development of Calais.
""It's in their interests that things go well,"" Collomb told the France 2 television channel on Tuesday ahead of a meeting between Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday in London.
Referring to the importance of Calais for the British economy, which faces uncertainty ahead of the country's exit from the European Union, Collomb added that ""a quarter of their trade transits through Calais.""
The original text of the Touquet accord, which came into force in February 2004, implemented joint controls at coastal ports in both countries as Britain, which is not part of Europe's Schengen visa-free zone, looked to bolster efforts to keep migrants out.
Later accords led to Britain financing some of the controls and security operations in Calais, just across the English Channel from its own port in
Dover.
Calais has long been a sore point in French-British relations, and Macron on Wednesday called for better cooperation in managing the border with Britain ahead of his first trip to London as president.
Record asylum claims
Migrants hoping to stow away on trucks bound for Britain have long been drawn to France's northern coast, with the squalid ""Jungle"" camp near Calais
once housing some 10,000 people before it was bulldozed by the government in late 2016.
Hundreds of migrants remain in the area, with police routinely breaking up makeshift camps of people hoping to head to Britain, a favoured destination
for Afghans and east Africans.
French officials argue the Le Touquet deal has worsened Europe's migrant crisis by creating a huge backflow of migrants in the area, lured by a belief
that it is easier to secure asylum and work permits in Britain.
A French human rights commission in 2015 said the accord had made France the ""police branch"" of Britain's immigration policies.
Macron made a renegotiation of the Le Touquet deal one of his campaign pledges, and Interior Minister Gerard Collomb signalled Tuesday that Paris would ask Britain to take in more refugees from northern France and increase its funding.
Brexit fears over economy in northern France
Macron sought to reassure the fishing industry and business owners in northern France on Tuesday over fears that Brexit will harm the local economy next year.
""I realise how much uncertainty there is in several economic sectors; fishing, industry, logistics,"" Macron said in a speech in the northern port of
Calais, ahead of a meeting with Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday.
A so-called 'hard border' with Britain could crimp the billions of euros' worth of goods that flow through the port each year, a grim prospect for local
businesses and industry executives.
""No matter the changes to come and the relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the territory will remain attractive in these areas,"" he said.
He said France would press its concerns with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who is scheduled to begin talks on an eventual
trade deal with Britain in March.
""The region's interests will be fully taken into account in the negotiations that France will lead, and I will make our case known in March
with our negotiator, Mr Barnier,"" he said.
Calais has long relied on its cross-Channel ties with Britain, which has also made the city a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Britain -- a
challenge that was the main focus of Macron's speech.

The Franco-German ministerial meeting, being held at the Meseberg castle north of Berlin, is seen as key for forging a consensus ahead of a crunch EU summit on June 28-29.
But Italy's refusal last week to allow a ship carrying 630 rescued migrants to dock on its shores has shattered the bloc's fragile status quo on dealing with the wave of people fleeing war and misery in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere since 2015.
Merkel herself is facing a showdown with her own hardline interior minister after his call for turning back undocumented migrants at German borders and speeding up ejections of rejected asylum seekers.
Most Germans support the moves according to opinion polls, while critics say Merkel's liberal migrant policies have bolstered far-right and populist parties at home and abroad.
EU deals with Turkey and Italy have sharply reduced the number of new arrivals, yet hundreds of people still attempt to cross the Mediterranean from Libya each day.
Merkel and Macron both agree on the need for a Europe-wide response, and are hoping to hammer out a policy acceptable to all member states that would ease the burden on Italy, Greece and other main entry points.
Yet the tensions that flared across Europe last week after Italy's move to block the Aquarius rescue ship have pushed any potential deal further from reach.
'Maximum of agreements'
Paris no longer harbours any illusion of securing a revamp of the so-called Dublin rules before the end-of-June deadline set by EU leaders last December.
The rules require migrants to apply for asylum in the first country they enter -- a policy France has used to defend its own efforts to keep people from trying to cross over from Italy.
But Paris is hoping to get Berlin's agreement on increased funding for the EU's Frontex border force, harmonised asylum rules and the creation of asylum processing centres in Africa.
""We're hoping to obtain a maximum of agreements on Tuesday, and in late June,"" a source in the French presidency told AFP.
That hope, however, is running up against an ""axis of the willing"" to combat immigration announced last week by Italy's new far-right interior minister and his German and Austrian counterparts.
And countries such as Hungary and Poland have either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under an EU quota system that has essentially floundered.
Common ground?
Despite the migrant policy headache, Macron and Merkel might find more common ground on deeper EU economic integration.
Macron, a centrist who swept to power last year, pledged to reconcile Europeans with the Union after years of austerity and growing disillusionment with the bloc's institutions. Merkel has cautiously come around in recent weeks, but she may not have much political room to manoeuvre further.
Rightwingers in her delicate governing coalition -- as well as several northern European countries -- remain hostile to France's push for a common eurozone budget, fearing taxpayers could foot the bill for fiscal irresponsibility in southern EU states.
Merkel made some concessions earlier this month, agreeing to support Macron's call for an investment fund to help poorer European countries catch up in the areas of science, technology and innovation. The size of the fund remains unclear, however, with Germany resisting the hundreds of billions of euros sought by France.
Nonetheless, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who will attend Tuesday's meeting along with the two countries' defence and foreign ministers, tweeted late Saturday that ""an agreement is close at hand"".
France and Germany may also strike a deal aimed at harmonising corporate taxes across the bloc, to stop multinationals from taking advantage of low-tax regimes in countries like the Netherlands, Ireland or Luxembourg.
Merkel said the common tax system would also help both countries shore up their competitiveness in the face of a potential trade war unleashed by US President Donald Trump.
Trump's threat to reduce US funding for NATO unless European members step up their contributions could also lead to new measures for strengthening EU defence cooperation.
Merkel has said she is ""favourable"" to a French call to create a European Intervention Initiative of forces which could be deployed rapidly to deal with crises outside the framework of NATO."

Around 200 officers took part in the operation which was going smoothly at Grande-Synthe, just outside the city, regional government official Eric Etienne told AFP.
Authorities estimate that 95 percent of the people at the site are Iraqi Kurds.
Etienne said the evacuation reflected the government's determination not to allow new ""shantytowns"" along France's northern coast of migrants trying to reach Britain.
A heavy police presence was deployed to prevent the repeated appearance of camps like the huge ""Jungle"" site near Calais, where more than 10,000 people were living before it was razed in 2016.
An estimated 800 migrants are currently in Grande-Synthe, municipal officials say.
Those evacuated Tuesday will be offered the chance to apply for asylum in France or be brought to police centres for ID checks.
Last month French lawmakers passed new legislation to accelerate asylum procedures by cutting the maximum processing time to 90 days after entry to France from 120 currently.
It also makes it easier to expel people whose applications are turned down, a move denounced by critics as an attempt to limit new arrivals."

The mayor instituted the ban on distributing food to migrants in the summer of 2015 when their arrivals, at first sporadic, began to block the train station, according to city hall.
It insisted that the mayor had taken that action for sanitary reasons.
""He didn't take the decision lightly. The unregulated distribution of food poses problems,"" city officials who declined to be named told AFP.
They pointed out that migrants can find assistance at a Red Cross camp outside the town and also from the Catholic charity Caritas.
The arrested volunteers were with the Roya Citoyenne (citizen) rights group in the Roya valley on the French-Italian border.
On the night of the arrests the group distributed 160 food bags including, apples and cans of tuna as well as some clothing for the migrants.
Since 2015 Europe has seen its worst migration crisis since World War II with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Ventimiglia has seen protests by migrants, many of whom hope to travel through France to northern Europe, where they may have friends and relatives or think they would have better job prospects.
There have also been clashes between police and activists, leading to the death of one police officer in August 2016.
The crisis has also seen several people arrested for people-smuggling between Italy and France, some claiming they were acting for humanitarian purposes and others charging migrants exorbitant fees."

The government has made plans to offer shelter to 12,000 migrants in asylum centres across France, according to a document from the Interior Ministry that Le Figaro newspaper has seen.
These will be the migrants who are currently amassed in the squalid Jungle Camp in Calais and in various unofficial camps across central Paris.
""A mobilization scheme has been validated in order to accommodate the migrants from Calais and Paris in shelters across the country,"" the document said, according to the paper.
The document was dated September 1st, the paper reported, offering ""guidelines"" for regional authorities across France.
It remains unclear exactly how the migrants will be distributed across France, although the document said that some 8,200 new spaces would be created nationwide to manage.
No migrants will be sent to Paris, where the migrant lodging situation was ruled to already be ""tense"", nor in Corsica, reported the paper.
Le Parisien newspaper reported that migrants would be sent to centres that could each hold up to around 300 people, with each region getting a weighted number of migrants relative to regional population.
It added that the moves would begin in mid-October.
In Paris, authorities have a separate plan to open up two humanitarian camps for thousands of migrants in the coming months.
One camp, near Porte de la Chapelle, is due to open by the end of September.
The notice comes as authorities work to relieve the pressure at the crowded Jungle camp in Calais, where police estimate that around 10,000 migrants currently call home.
This figure is up from the 4,500 estimated by aid groups in June this year.
""Soon there'll be so many people in the 'Jungle' that each passing day makes a mass evacuation all the more risky,"" Jean-Claude Delage of the police union Alliance told Le Figaro late last month.
The nearby Grande-Synthe camp, not far from Dunkirk, hosts another 2,000 or so migrants, taking the population of in the northern reaches of France up to around 12,000.
While the number of migrants in the camp causes immigration authorities to fret, it has also been raised as a security issue for France.
Senior police officers in Calais have also said that the migrant camp was a ""blind spot"" in France's security.
""It's truly mind boggling what's going on there,"" said an officer of the CRS force, which is tasked with maintaining public order. ""It's worse than ever.""
""It's impossible to know if, for example, a jihadist from Belgium is hiding in there. This camp is a blind spot for national security in the middle of the state of emergency.""
And the camp isn't always a peaceful one.
There have been numerous reports in the French press of some of these migrants getting involved in brawls in the camp, with one Sudanese migrant killed last week in clashes with Afghan migrants.
Denis Hurt of the police union Unsa estimated that around 20 migrants make it to the UK each night, with some of them turning to violence to get there.
But not all find the ""El Dorado"" in England that they expected, with Hurt adding that sometimes migrants actually return to Calais once again.
Work is set to begin this month on a giant wall, funded by Britain, which aims to block migrants from trying to jump aboard lorries heading for the port of Calais. However, aid organizations say it is a waste of money and ""nothing will deter"" the migrants from attempting to reach their desired destination."

Protesters in a town in southwest France have built a nearly-two-metre-high wall around the entrance to a disused hotel to try to prevent it being turned into a migrant shelter.
Working under cover of darkness, a few dozen residents of Semeac in the Pyrenees mountains erected a wall 18 metres (60 feet) long and 1.8 metres high barring access to the Formule 1 hotel, a spokesman for the group confirmed.
""We not against taking in migrants,"" Laurent Teixeira told AFP. ""But you have to take account of the citizens.""

Teixeira accused the authorities of failing to consult residents about the project to turn the former budget hotel into a shelter for up to 85 migrants.
""Nothing is planned for the migrants' daily life,"" he said, arguing that schools and other public services in the town of 5,000 people would be unable to cope with the newcomers.
Protester Hugo Lacoue, a tobacconist, said he was opposed to migrants being hosted in a suburban neighbourhood.
The hotel in Semeac is one of 62 budget hostelries bought by the state in order to house some of the asylum-seekers currently sleeping rough on the streets of Paris or the northern port of Calais.
With the pace of migrant arrivals expected to accelerate this summer, the government has come under pressure to create more shelters.
More than 2,800 people were evacuated earlier this month from a makeshift camp that sprung up around a packed migrant centre in northern Paris, but a new camp is already forming in the area.
Last year, several French towns saw protests over the establishment of migrant shelters but in most places the protests died down after the migrants moved in."

Only if you're French!"" snorts Jacob Garji, one of hundreds of migrants living
rough in Calais who are hunted nightly by police.
Fifteen months after a squalid camp housing thousands of people aiming to sneak into Britain was bulldozed, the French Channel port is still synonymous with broken dreams.
On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron swept into town, vowing to stop Calais from serving as an antechamber for migrants desperate to reach Britain.
But the brutal tactics used by French police to prevent the re-emergence of another ""Jungle"", as the demolished camp was nicknamed, risk tarnishing the image of a country that sees itself as a beacon of human rights.
Several migrants told AFP they had repeatedly been woken in the woods around Calais by police who sprayed them with ""gas"" -- NGOs have reported the use of pepper spray -- and seized their belongings.
On his visit to Calais Macron ordered police to stop taking away o destroying migrants' belongings.
""They gas the tent while you're sleeping or gas you in your face. The tent, they take it, the sleeping bag, they take it. They even take the medicine given to us in the hospital,"" said Dawit, a 21-year-old Ethiopian migrant, as he queued in the cold for tea and bread distributed by a local charity.
Police have in the past denied using pepper spray against migrants and said they seize belongings abandoned by those who flee for fear of being detained.
Using Dawit as an interpreter, several Ethiopians also described being detained by police and dumped outside Calais, about two hours on foot from
their camp -- part of what NGOs describe as a strategy to disperse migrants.
Home for the Ethiopians, whose clothes are splattered with mud, is currently a copse next to an industrial estate towered over by giant
electricity pylons.
Jacob Garji, 21, and his brother David, 22, have also set up camp there on the final leg of their family's journey from Iran through Europe.
The brothers, from a Jewish family of Afghan origin that fled anti-Semitism and discrimination against Afghans, have tried nightly over the past three
weeks to stow away on trucks crossing to Britain -- to no avail.
But the conditions endured by migrants on the streets of France have only hardened their resolve.
In Paris, the two men were shocked to meet asylum-seekers sleeping under bridges for months while waiting for their claims to be processed.
In Calais, they have frequently been detained and also had their tent repeatedly torn down by police.
""I am ready to spend one or two years to get to Britain. It is my future"" said Jacob, who speaks fluent French and English but has no desire to linger
in a country that ""is only good for French people"".
'Exhaustion' strategy
NGOs have accused Macron, who campaigned for president last year as a champion of open borders, of betraying France's long tradition of offering
sanctuary by drawing a strict line between those fleeing war or persecution and so-called ""economic"" migrants.
Three charities on Tuesday refused an invitation to meet with him to discuss a new immigration and asylum plan.
Brice Benazzouz, regional coordinator of the Medecins du Monde medical charity, accused the police in Calais of trying to drive out migrants by
""exhaustion"".
Francois Guennoc, vice president of the Auberge des Migrants charity, said he did not want to be ""a mere alibi for a strategy that is already well
established.""
Both charities called for a review of a 2003 agreement that effectively pushed Britain's border across the Channel into France, trapping migrants
there.
Macron has vowed to press Britain at a summit meeting Thursday to shoulder more of the migrant burden, while maintaining a tough line on ""illegal
occupation of public space"".
It's a line that has gone over well in Calais.
""They should be sent back home to their country,"" Fabienne Bouin, a 53-year-old housekeeper, told AFP, accusing the migrants of being ""aggressive"".
Ludovic Deconinck, the amiable manager of a busy cafe in the town centre, said that he was not personally bothered by the migrants' presence but worried the situation had ""affected the Calais brand"".
""I feel sorry for them but there's not much we can do for them,"" he said."

France announced Monday it would open two shelters for migrants sleeping rough around the port of Calais, relenting to pressure to improve the lot of hundreds of people hiding from police.
The centres will be located in the towns of Troisvaux and Bailleul, situated about 80 kilometres (50 miles) inland from Calais, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.
Each will have a capacity of 300, he told reporters, estimating the number of migrants currently in the northern port at 350-400.
His announcement came hours after France's highest administrative court ordered the state to provide running water and sanitation for the migrants, saying that its refusal so far to do so ""exposed them to inhuman and degrading treatment.""

The Council of State, which estimates the number of migrants at 400-700, was ruling on an appeal by the interior ministry and the city of Calais against an injunction issued by a court in Lille last month.
In its decision Monday the Council of State upheld the order sought by a group of charities, saying that migrants were developing skin diseases such as scabies and festering wounds as they had no way of washing themselves or their clothes.
The situation was causing ""serious psychological problems"", it added, calling the state's failure to address the situation ""a serious and clearly illegal blow to a basic right"".
Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart, from the centre-right Republicans party, said she would ignore the order.
""In the absence of a national and European policy offering a global solution on controlling immigration, Calais will not implement the injunctions,"" she declared, warning of the emergence of ""yet another Jungle"" -- the sprawling informal camp from which over 6,000 migrants were evacuated last year.
Collomb however said the migrants would quickly be given improved access to water.
The minister had previously argued, like Bouchart, that the provision of services could have a pull effect on migrants who trek across Europe to Calais in the hope of stowing away on a truck crossing the Channel to England.
In June, he warned the city risked developing a migrant ""abscess"".
'Individual excesses'
But in recent days the government has softened its tone.
President Emmanuel Macron last week promised to find temporary shelter for all those on the streets by the end of the year.
Collomb said the addition of two new shelters to some 450 already in operation around the country would help speed up the processing of asylum claims from those migrants who wished to stay in France.
""We do not want to repeat the bad experiences of the past,"" he warned, alluding to the squalid Jungle.
Collomb also announced an internal police investigation into claims of excessive force being used by officers against the migrants in Calais.
In a report entitled ""Like living in hell"" Human Rights Watch last week accused the police of routinely using pepper spray on asylum seekers and migrants.
Collomb said the security forces did not use pepper spray but he did not rule out ""excesses by a few individuals""."

An anti-migrant demonstration in the Brittany village of Arzon degenerated on Monday night when police were forced to fire tear gas after protesters kicked down the door of a centre where young migrants were being lodged.
A number of protesters were arrested after forcing their way into the centre, regional newspaper Ouest-France reported.
Police were forced to stand guard at the entrance throughout the night.
According to Ouest-France around 100 members of far-right 'identitaire' groups travelled to the village to hold the protest. Reports say very few locals joined in.

The protest had been organised by right wing groups after the regional prosecutor confirmed that a 67-year-old local woman had been sexually assaulted by a young Sudanese migrant on Thursday November 10th.
The 16-year-old had been placed in the local centre to accommodate refugee minors after being moved out of Calais when the Jungle camp was cleared.
The extremist groups had accused the local authorities of covering up the incident, but the prosecutor hit back saying the assault had been greatly exaggerated on social media.
François Touron, the prosecutor in the town of Vannes told Ouest France: “The victim was taking the shopping out of her car when she was approached by a young man. In broken English he told her that her house was beautiful. Then he gave her a kiss. After the fifth kiss the woman pushed him back.”
The prosecutor continued: “The young man, from Sudan, touched the woman’s left breast, but at no point did he expose himself. He made a gesture as if he was masturbating, then ran off quickly.”
The 67-year-old victim reported the incident to police and the 16-year-old migrant was arrested and charged with sexual assault. He was later released and is due to go before a court in Brittany in March.
Mayor of Arzon Roland Tabart told Ouest France: “Since Thursday I have been in permanent contact with the local authority and the local police.
“There has been a complaint and there is an investigation.
The mayor said staff from Britain’s immigration services were working with French authorities about the relocation of the young migrants in the centre to the UK.
""A number of young migrants will leave for the UK as planned,"" said Tabart. It is not clear whether the young Sudanese migrant will be moved from the local area.
Thousands of migrants have been moved to orientation centres around France since the Calais Jungle was closed last month.
The reception they have been granted has been mixed. While some are greeted warmly, some locals have held protests against the welcoming of migrants in their town.

A notorious French mayor sparked outrage among rights groups Wednesday after putting up anti-migrant posters and calling for
a local referendum ahead of the arrival of asylum seekers in his town.
Under the headline ""That's It, They're Coming"", is an image of a crowd of migrants, all of them men, outside the cathedral of the southern town of Beziers.
""The state is imposing them on us,"" the poster reads. ""Migrants in our town centre.""
The poster put out by Mayor Robert Menard, an ally of the far-right National Front, is a reaction to government plans to relocate thousands of migrants from the north coast to dozens of sites around France.
It is reminiscent of a controversial poster created by leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, former head of Britain's anti-immigration UK Independence Party (UKIP), showing a vast queue of migrants under the slogan ""Breaking Point"".
People naturally took to Twitter to condemn Menard.
""A Town Hall campaign worthy of Vichy France. This mayor is a shame on our Republique,"" said one.

'I'll do everything to ensure that these migrants don't settle in'
""SOS Racism has called for the region's governor to step in and stop Menard's planned referendum.
And the government's anti-racism body DILCRA has called on the prosecutor's office in Beziers to investigate what it says is a ""flagrant"" example of incitement to hatred.
""The repeated targeting of people or groups because of their origin or their beliefs cannot be accepted,"" it said in a statement.
Speaking to French radio Wednesday, Menard said: ""I'll do everything to ensure that these migrants don't settle in.""
Beziers' mayor since 2014, Menard said he had not been informed that a migrant reception centre was planned in the town and thought residents should be allowed to vote in a referendum asking whether the migrants should be accepted.
The government plans to break up the ""Jungle"", a shantytown near Calais in northern France currently occupied by up to 9,000 migrants.
But while most communities have mobilised to help the new arrivals, the authorities in some smaller towns have objected, saying the government has imposed the new arrivals on them.
A few towns have seen anti-migrant demonstrations and some of the reception centres being prepared have been attacked.
Menard was for 23 years the head of the media rights group Reporters Without Borders, which has distanced itself from him since he left in 2008.
He has been accused of racism on numerous occasions due to his history of causing a storm in his town from the moment he tried to chase out Syrian refugees from his town to banning the opening of kebab shops.
As is often the case these days, the Twittersphere took pleasure in mocking Menard by producing some spoof posters with pictures of French far right figures rather than migrants.

The Calais ""Jungle"" is in the process of being dismantled, with thousands of migrants being taken to 451 reception centres all over France.
The move, which is estimated to last all week, has already prompted fierce opposition in parts of France, with some protesters taking to the streets to express their anger at the prospect of migrants being located in their towns.
This opposition has continued as the resettlement continues.
In the town of Chardonnay, famous for the grapes which share the same name, two dozen young Sudanese asylum seekers received a fairly luke-warm reception on Monday evening.
Locals watched from a distance as the men got off the bus in the village, which will eventually host 50 asylum seekers among a population of just 200 villagers.
""This massive arrival of migrants, it's inappropriate,"" said angry resident Joelle Chevaux, out walking her dog.
The map above shows how the migrants will be redsettled.
Residents in Saint-Brévin-les-Pins, a coastal town in western France with a population of 13,000, were even clearer about how they weren't happy to be getting 50 migrants.
Around 600 people signed a petition against the migrants coming, a petition that was launched after an unknown assailant opened fire on the migrant centre earlier this month.
""Fifty single men in a small town like this, that's quite a lot actually,"" one resident told France Info on Tuesday.
However at the weekend some 400 residents turned out for a demonstration in support of welcoming the migrants.
Elsewhere, a migrant centre in Loubeyrat in central France's Puy-de-Dôme was torched on Sunday night and other similar acts of vandalism were carried out at centres in Arès in the Gironde department, and at Forges-les-Bains not far from Paris.
Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse denounced these ""violent incidents"".
""This is totally unacceptable behaviour,"" she said. ""Everyone must support this worthy policy of reception and the implementation of asylum.""
Solidarité
For every violent episode, however, there are stories of support.
A pro-migrant rally in Paris on Monday attracted 200 people, who stood at the interior ministry chanting ""Paris, Calais, solidarity!""
There were also pro-migrant protests in western France's Nantes, where police estimated that around 250 people turned up to show their support.
Up to 200 people marched in nearby Rennes, holding signs saying things like ""No human being is illegal"".

Clambering up on to the bus, Sol told them: ""We are happy to welcome you all. The residents here will come to your aid and we will too.""
The mayor of north eastern France's Sainte-Menehould, Bertrand Courot, also welcomed the migrants on Tuesday.
""We are among those to stretch out a helping hand, and we hope other towns can do the same thing,"" he told France 3.
""It says Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité on the front of our town hall, these are the values we defend, and it's good to say it, but even better to do it.""
Rafael Flichman, the spokesman for the La Cimade association helping migrants and refugees, says there has been an outpouring of support for migrants across the country - although he noted that it doesn't always make the mainstream media.
""Unfortunately, most of the time, the French media seems to prefer to write about the racist demonstrations against migrants rather than positive initiatives,"" he told The Local.
Flichman added that small towns in France have already seen positive affects as newly arrived migrants bonded with locals.
In reality the welcome afforded the new residents seems to depend on each town there will be supporters and opponents everywhere.
President François Hollande and his government who took the risky move of dispersing the Jungle migrants around France will hope the French live up to their much-vaunted principal of fraternité."

The operation was carried out by the state services, the Town of Paris and police headquarters, and took around two hours.
The Stalingrad Metro station was closed to the public during the evacuation.
People living at the camp had been sleeping on old mattresses or even just cardboard, many with nothing but a plastic bag of possessions.
Migrants from the camp were transported via bus to accommodation facilities in the suburbs of Paris, or outside of the city altogether, where they will be given a month to begin the process of seeking asylum.
The operation was the second at the Stalingrad station this month alone.
On March 7th, the camp had been cleared of around 400 migrants, although more migrants moved in within days.
The evacuation was the 19th of its kind in Paris since June last year, which has seen 6,500 migrants moved to emergency shelters.
More than one million migrants -- about half of them Syrians -- reached Europe via the Mediterranean last year, a rate of arrival that has continued through the first three months of 2016.
Germany has taken in the bulk of the migrants. Nearly 80,000 people applied for asylum in France in 2015.

The boat, which is due to arrive in Spain on Sunday morning with more than 600 people on board, has been the heart of a major migration row between European Union member states.
""The French government will work together with the Spanish government to handle the arrival of the migrants"", Spain's deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo said in a statement.
""France will accept migrants who express the wish to go there"" once they have been processed in Valencia, the statement said.
Chartered by a French aid group, the vessel rescued 629 migrants including many children and pregnant women off Libya's cost last weekend. Doctors Without Borders (MSF), who along with French charity SOS Mediterranée are treating migrants on board Aquarius, said two passengers drowned last weekend when the ship first encountered difficulties off Libya.
The passengers come from 26 countries, mainly from Africa but also Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, according to MSF.
Among them are 450 adult men and 80 women -- including at least seven pregnant women -- as well as 11 under-13s and 93 adolescents, according to the latest figures released by authorities in Valencia.
A team of 2,320 people has been mobilised to meet them, including 1,000 Red Cross volunteers and 470 translators.
Refused entry
Italy's new populist government and Malta refused to let Aquarius dock in their ports, accusing each other of failing to meet their humanitarian and EU commitments.
Spain eventually stepped in and agreed to receive the refugees. France -- who had angered Rome by branding it irresponsible over the vessel rejection -- offered Thursday to welcome Aquarius migrants who ""meet the criteria for asylum"".
The ship is making the 1,500-kilometre (930-mile) voyage to Spain accompanied by Italian coast guard vessels, which have taken on board some of the migrants.
High waves and winds forced the convoy to take a detour on the way, but the first migrants are expected to land in Valencia between 6am (0800 GMT) and 12pm (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
EU divisions
The plight of the Aquarius has again highlighted the failure of EU member states to work together to deal with the influx of migrant arrivals since 2015. After Rome's decision to ban the Aquarius, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met on Friday and agreed that the EU should set up asylum processing centres in Africa to prevent ""voyages of death.""
They also demanded ""profound"" changes to the EU's asylum rules which put the migrant burden on their port of entry to Europe -- mainly Italy and Greece.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini warned Saturday that other NGO operated rescue ships would also be banned from docking.
""While the Aquarius is sailing towards Spain, two other Dutch NGO operated vessels (Lifeline and Seefuchs) have arrived off the Libyan coast, to wait for their human cargos once the people smugglers abandon them,"" Salvini said in a Facebook post.
""These people should know that Italy no longer wants to be any part of this business of clandestine immigration and they will have to look for other ports to go to,"" he said.
""As minister and as a father, I take this action for the benefit of all,"" he added."

""The aim is to have a coordinated and concerted approach to the influx of migrants in the central Mediterranean,"" as well as ""how best to help the Italians,"" the source close to the issue said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron both expressed their backing for Italy after meeting in Berlin.
""Germany will certainly help Italy face this problem,"" Merkel said.
Macron meanwhile cited the Italian premier as saying that more than 80 percent of the migrants were seeking a better life economically and were not fleeing war or persecution.

But there are some darker sides to life in the city of light.
Everyone knows the term Paris syndrome, used for tourists who are said to be suffering the shattered dreams that inevitably result from overexposure to clichés prior to their arrival in the City of Light.
But we are not talking about the myths and legends of moody waiters, rude locals and piles of pavement dog poo that might leave the odd tourist disappointed.
There is a grittier reality to life in the French capital, that is worth noting, although it shouldn't put you off visiting.
Sexual harassment on transport
Groping on the Metro, soliciting in the street, catcalling and worse...the City of Love isn't always quite as romantic as its reputation would have us believe.
According to a study conducted in 2016, one in two women in France said they will choose trousers over a skirt to avoid becoming the victim of sexual harassment on public transport.
And a 2015 survey of women commuters around Paris revealed that 100 percent of respondents said they had been a victim of sexual harassment.
As the wave of allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and ensuing #MeToo campaign took hold in 2017, the subject of women's issues felt even more pertinent in France where a new law is set to be introduced to impose on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment of women on the streets.
In October 2017 when The Local went on to the street to talk to women about their experiences of sexual harassment, Madeleine La Salle, a 30-year-old Parisian woman said: ""During one packed Metro journey a man pressed up against me and placed his erect penis between my buttocks.
""I was so scared, I was shaking. I didn't know what to do,"" she said.
And La Salle wasn't alone. Every woman we spoke to had a story to tell.
On the positive side, the government has launched numerous campaigns against harassment on transport and there is hope that the awareness brought about in recent months by #Metoo will make a difference.

Paris's own migrant crisis
In recent years Paris has seen sprawling squalid migrant camps spring up all over the city. The latest to be cleared was the one that housed thousands along the Canal St Martin in the 10th arrondissement.
""Teachers in school taught us about France and what a wonderful place it was,"" Khater, who said he was 15 years old, as he stood by the dozens of tents strung along the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin that now serve as home for hundreds of migrants, told The Local.
""I didn't think it would be like this,"" he said, surveying the squalid scene along the canal, whose banks in summer host hundreds of trendy youngsters drinking beer or wine late into the night.
And while in parts of Paris it's the historic Haussmann architecture or the beautiful parks that dominate the view, in other parts, mostly the north and north east of the capital - it's the tented communities that regularly emerge that draws people's eyes.

France's handling of the migrant crisis, or mishandling, as many would see it, has been the subject of much hand wringing on the part of the French government, rights groups and the general public.
Critics ask why France appears to be failing refugees that end up here when Germany has been able to handle more than a million migrants since 2015, with few if any of them having to live in the squalor seen on Paris streets or at the notorious Calais “Jungle” that was finally shut down just over a year ago.
While authorities appear keen not to allow these camps to emerge it feels only a matter of time until the next one. The migrant crisis is here to stay, it seems.
(A migrant camp under Line 2 of the Paris Metro in 2015. It has since been destroyed.)
There are also the camps set up by the Roma community around the city (see photo below), which are regularly pulled down by the police. Another problem that doesn't seem to have a solution.

Homelessness
The scale of the problem of rough sleeping on the streets of Paris is hard to ignore, with the sheer number of people begging in the French capital raising the eyebrows of locals and visitors alike.
Whether it's someone appealing to commuters on the Metro, or the more discreet appeal of the person holding up a cardboard sign asking for money for food (Pour manger s'il vous plait) on a street corner, it's impossible not to notice just how many people here are searching for a petite pièce.
From the limbless beggars crawling through the carriages on the Metro and the people who approach you as you sit outside of brasseries, to the families in bus shelters and those who play a song or write a poem in exchange for some small change, the variety and amount of begging in Paris can be shocking for those unfamiliar with the city. And sometimes even for those who live here.

""There have been more and more French people ending up on the streets in recent years with rising unemployment. And there is a problem with the lack of local solidarity,"" Louis-Xavier Leca, Director of La Cloche, an organisation that promotes relationships between neighbourhood businesses, residents and the homeless living there, told The Local.
""After my own experience spending time in Chile and West Africa, I think it can be worse to fall on hard times in Paris than in poorer countries. People tend to be more isolated here,"" he added.
Drugs
The problem of drugs blights most cities but it often appears more visible in certain parts of Paris.
Obviously if you head over to the wealthy 8th or 16th arrondissements you are unlikely to get the impression that the City of Light is overrun by dealers and crack addicts.
However try parts of the 19th, 18th or 10th arrondissements where authorities and police have struggled to deal with the extent of the problem.
After police moved in to close a so-called ""crack hill"" on the edge of the city earlier in 2018 dealers and their addicts moved into more central parts of the city.
Paris : le retour du crack électrise la place de Stalingrad https://t.co/uBKxvzTJOT
— Le Parisien (@le_Parisien) August 31, 2018
Place de Stalingrad which borders the 10th, 18th and 19th arrondissements and is home to trendy bars became the new hub for dealers selling crack for as little as €6.
The sight of addicts injecting themselves with drugs or smoking them has become in a square once frequented by families. Police and the Paris mayor have vowed to tackle the problem.
Gare du Nord
Gare du Nord is often cited by visitors as being a somewhat underwhelming even dirty and smelly introduction to Paris.
From the smell of urine outside, the dilapidated ceilings, lack of signage and leaky ceilings to the narrow platforms, closed shops, lack of space or the general all round filth, the station has a few well-documented issues.
In fact, it was once dubbed ""the squalor pit of Europe"" by a British exec and even these days you don't have to spend long there to think it might still be deserving of the name.
Part of the problem is the station is located in one of the city's most problematic areas for drugs and alcoholics, with other stations in the north east of Paris showing signs of the strain.
Indeed, the prevalence of dealers and addicts at some Metro stops has led some drivers to skip certain stations because of the drugs related violence, particularly on lines 12 and 4.
Happily -- at least for Gard du Nord and its users -- there are plans to finally give the station a much needed makeover which it is hoped will be finished just in time for the Paris Olympics in 2024.

Homophobic violence
Paris is not a city people associate with homophobia given its thriving gay scene.
If you judged the city by a night out in the Marais quarter you wouldn't get the impression the city's gay community were cowering in fear.
They are not, but that doesn't mean there isn't a longstanding problem with homophobia.
Indeed in Autumn 2018 a string of violent homophobic attacks shocked the city and its leaders and brought the issue to the public attention.
""I'm gay and this is 2018,"" said Guillaume Mélanie, President of Urgence Homophobie, pictured below on the right, who was one of the victims.
Mayor Anne Hidalgo has vowed to take action and former deputy mayor of Paris, Bruno Julliard also regretted ""the proliferation of homophobic attacks, public insults, savage 'outings' and incessant insults on social networks.
""Homophobia is doing very well in 2018. It is no longer bearable, it requires collective action: the police, justice system, schools, associations. Quickly,"" he said.
Antisemitic attacks
There have been 11 anti-Semitic murders in France since 2000 but the killing of an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor in her Paris home in March 2018 which echoed that of another elderly Jewish woman in Paris, left the community in France particularly shocked and scared.
Two people were charged with the brutal murder of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Jewish woman, who was repeatedly stabbed and whose body was then set alight in a crime being treated as anti-Semitic by French police.
This violent murder which has echoes of a similar case from April 2017 in which Sarah Halimi was also killed in her own home in the same 11th arrondissement of Paris.
It's not just the brutal murders.
There have been incidents in the suburbs of the capital where Jewish stores have been burned down and young Jewish boys beaten up for wearing the Kippa.
And the incident when anti-Semitic graffiti reading ""Jewish scum live here"" was scrawled on the door of a Paris apartment building caused shock and anger in the French capital.

Inequality: Paris vs. the banlieues
When people think of the Paris banlieues (if they do at all), it's likely they either think of them at best as grey, lifeless neighbourhoods full of tower blocks and at worst as places of poverty, violence and crime. There is an element of truth to both.
And it's also true that life in the banlieues is startingly different to life in the French capital, essentially because they've been neglected over the years at the expense of the inner city centre where threre is more wealth, as well as resources and prospects. This is actually referred to as the ""donut effect"".
Successive French governments have been accused of failing to do enough to mend the massive inequality and have been accused of following an ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach to the banlieues.
In truth, most visitors to Paris will have little reason to venture beyond the peripherique ring road which acts as the barrier between Paris and ""not-Paris"".
In 2017, The Local reported that the banlieues were ripe for a repeat of the riots seen there in 2005 when France was forced to declare a state of emergency.
Despite the soul-searching prompted by the outbreak of those riots and may since, there has been very little positive outcome.
And that's in spite of various government initiatives and billions of euros spent over the years.
""There's been a decline that has set in in recent years that is approaching on the irreparable, because ten years on these suburbs are no longer producing rioters, they are producing terrorists,"" said Malek Boutih, an MP for the département of Essonne to the south of Paris and former head of SOS Racism in 2015
On the plus side, the Grand Paris project should at least boost transport links to the outer suburbs and is a sign that psychologically at least Paris is starting to acknowledge it must think of itself as a city whose limits don't suddenly stop at the periphérique.

Gangs
Paris might not be a city known for its gang culture and knife crime like London is, but rivalries between groups of teenagers recently left a 15-year-old dead near Bastille as the problem, fueled by social media, continues to concern police and authorities.
The violence has once again focused attention on an issue -- not one that is not particularly new but one which is increasingly worrying the French authorities -- in part due to the young age of those being drawn into violent groups.
""It's very worrying. There is real trivialization of violence among young people. These are boys as young as 13, more often that not from tough neighbourhoods, who are marginalized and often not in schools. They also lack any kind of parental framework,"" Yvan Assioma, from the Alliance police union, told The Local.
Photo: AFP
Since 2009 a special police unit has been tasked with monitoring and mapping the violence among rival groups of youths. There are believed to be around 40 different groups in Paris, mostly based in the outer arrondissements in the north and east of the city.
Police are however reluctant to call them ""gangs"", because they insist there is very little organisation and structure.
""These are just young people, who might be from the same arrondissement, block of flats or school. There might be a core of five or six, perhaps up to 10, but then they can grow very quickly if needed,"" said Assioma. ""And they can also dissolve pretty quickly too.
""There is no leader or structure like in organised gangs and they often just form for a spontaneous event for any kind of motive.""
Threat of terrorism
The threat of terrorism has plagued France and in particular its capital since 2015, after jihadist attacks left scores dead.
Despite the violence, bars, restaurants and music venues have recovered well since the attacks in November 2015 and Parisians go about their daily lives as normal.
But while the country's state of emergency may have been lifted in November 2017 -- after two years of being in place -- and replaced with a new anti-terror laws the threat remains, with the government saying it thwarts attacks on a regular basis.
It is still the norm to see soldiers and armed police wandering around the tourist hotspots as well as quiet, residential areas of the city.
Attacks on police and soldiers at tourist sites including Notre-Dame, the Champs-Elysees and the Louvre means a high police and military presence is inevitable and given most experts believe the threat will remain for a generation, it is likely to remain that way.
There has also been a marked increase in general security, such as guards at the entrances to bars, shops and concert venues with customers and revellers forced to undergo body searches and bag checks.
While this doesn't really fit in with the fairy tale image of Paris that is so popular worldwide, locals have just got used to it and although tourists numbers have fallen, millions still come through the arrival gates.

He asked: ""Does Paris, which claims to be civil, find it normal to throw people into the woods?.""
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Tuesday hit out at President Emmanuel Macron after French police were caught committing the ""unprecedented offence"" of dumping migrants in Italian woods.
Salvini (pictured below), also deputy prime minister and head of the anti-immigrant League party, on Monday demanded a ""clear response"" after French authorities admitted to returning migrants to Italy in ""error"".
A French police van was seen on Friday driving into Italy to return recently-arrived migrants to the town of Claviere.
""It was an error to enter Italian territory without the authorisation of the Italian police,"" said Cecile Bigot-Dekeyzer, the top official in the Hautes-Alpes region.
""The police had no right to enter Italian territory,"" the prefect said.
An outraged Salvini batted away that explanation, while France said the incident should be ""kept in perspective"".
""Abandoning migrants in an Italian wood can't be just a mistake or an incident,"" Salvini said on social media. ""What happened in Claviere is an unprecedented offence towards our country.""
""Does Paris, which claims to be civil, find it normal to throw people into the woods?... We're dealing with an international shame, and Mr Macron can't pretend he doesn't know. We won't accept any excuses,"" Salvini wrote.
'It was a mistake'
""Let's keep this in perspective,"" an official in the French president's office told journalists on Tuesday.
""It was a mistake, the authorities have admitted that. There was an incursion, not planned or according to procedure, into Italian territory, where two people were dropped off.""
Thousands of migrants are caught each year trying to enter France and returned to the Italian border. Last year AFP journalists saw French police dropping off migrants in front of Bardonecchia train station, in Italy.
A source close to Macron slammed Salvini's ""essentially individual political exploitation"" of the incident.
Italian Prime Minister ""Giuseppe Conte hasn't turned this incident into proof of a crisis,"" the French presidency said.
""We manage our shared border together and there are occasional small regrettable incidents on both sides.""
Relations between Rome and Paris have been increasingly tense in recent months, with Italy's populist government accusing France and others of failing to share the burden of the 700,000 migrants and asylum seekers that have crossed the Mediterranean to come to Italy since 2013.
French police in March sparked outrage by carrying out identity checks at Bardonecchia station, with the Italian foreign ministry summoning the French ambassador to protest.
In June, Macron criticised Salvini for closing Italian ports to the Aquarius migrant rescue boat, prompting a fresh summoning of the ambassador."

The fire ignited at the migrant accommodation in Forges-les-Bains, south west of Paris, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, reported to BFM TV.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Tuesday afternoon that all possible light will be shed on the matter to determine whether the fire was started voluntarily.
""If this hypothesis is confirmed, everything will be done to quickly arrest those behind this abject act and bring them to justice,"" he said.
The building, which was set to house 90 migrants when it opens in October, had proved to be highly contentious in the local community.
The night before it was burned, authorities had held a meeting about the centre while around 100 locals protested outside.
These protests continued until around 11pm, BFM TV reported, and just hours later the building caught fire.
The exact cause of the fire remains unconfirmed, but police have launched an investigation.
No injuries were reported.
The incident comes as the mayor of Paris announced that the first refugee camp in the capital will open in mid-October with an initial capacity of 400.
The centre, which will be housed in an old railway site in the north of Paris, aims to replace the makeshift camps that keep springing up around the city.

Hidalgo, who had announced in May that the camp would be created, said asylum-seekers would be allowed stay there for ""five to 10 days"" and would receive medical and psychological care.
Hidalgo, a Socialist, said the €6.5-million ($7.2 million) Paris centre aimed to take asylum-seekers off the streets while they wait for a place in an official hostel set aside for refugees.
A second centre, for women and children only, will be opened in Ivry-sur-Seine to the southeast of Paris by the end of the year, she told a press conference.

					16:27 CEST+02:00				",The Local,"After Calais, France faces growing migrant crisis in Paris","While all the focus has been on the closure of the Jungle in Calais, France must deal with the thousands of migrants sleeping rough in Paris. And their numbers are growing.
Flimsy tents packed tightly, clothes strung across makeshift washing lines, rubbish piling up and lines of people queuing quietly for their next meal, cooked by volunteers.
It might sound like a scene from the Calais Jungle but it's a road in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, one of the wealthiest cities in the world.
Since the much-mediatized closure of the Jungle camp in Calais this week there have been worries among residents and authorities that hundreds of dispersed migrants, who refused to be sent to one of the 450 reception centres around France, will descend on Paris, shifting the humanitarian crisis from Calais to the capital.
Charles Drane, coordinator of an NGO that helps asylum-seekers sleeping rough in northeast Paris told AFP his charity was now feeding over 1,000 people a day, up from 700-800 a few days ago.
But the reality is that the migrant crisis in Paris has existed for some 18 months now. While numbers may have swelled a little this week, the situation is no worse than it has been for months.
(AFP)
Camps have sprung up and mushroomed underneath the Metro tracks near Jaures, Stalingrad and La Chapelle stations numerous times since last summer.
When the police move in to the close them, and bus everyone out to temporary accommodation, which they have done over 20 times since the beginning of the summer, the tents reappear within days.
Police have fenced off much of the areas underneath the overground Metro in the north east of Paris, but that just means homeless migrants have to find other places for their tents.
A member of staff at France Terre d’Asile, the organisation based near Jaures Metro station where migrants must initially register if they want to claim asylum in France, said the situation has long been critical in Paris, no matter what happened in Calais this week.
“The problem is already here. The refugees have always moved between Calais and Paris, often depending on what action police take down here,” the staff member, who wanted to remain anonymous, told The Local.
In July police evacuated some 2,000 migrants from a sprawling ""camp"" outside the offices of France Terre d’Asile, but within hours new tents had been erected.
""The crisis is not going away anytime soon and it will be the same in Calais,"" said the staff member.
Paris had been due to open up an official “humanitarian” camp in the north of city but it has been hit by delays. When and if it finally opens it will only hold 400 people and will only offer temporary accommodation.
(AFP)
Part of the problem, which might not surprise those with a knowledge of French bureaucracy, is that it takes months to process their applications.
During that time the French government has not shown the will to provide migrants with a roof over their heads until their applications are dealt with.
France Terre d’Asile can only register a small number of applications each day. After registering migrants are given an appointment with the prefecture of police, but there next available slots are not until January.
""They should be given a place to stay from day one, like in Germany,"" said the staff member.
(The Local)
And in the meantime the migrants, who are mainly from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, must wait outside in the growing cold and wet and rely on charities or locals to help them.
Many are taking steps to help their chances of staying in France. Dozens attend French classes in Place Stalingrad, run by volunteers (see photo below).
(The Local)
In the meantime some like Almas Khan, a 22-year-old from Afghanistan, have vowed to return to Calais and try once again to get to the UK.
“I want to see London Bridge and the London Eye,” he told The Local. “I have spent six months in a tent, either in Paris or in Calais. I have spent all my money. The French government has done nothing for us.""
His friend Almas Nazari, 32, added: “If they just gave us a home, some food, a little money, we would be happy. If they give us nothing, then we will stay in the streets.”
And as for the idea of going back to Afghanistan?
“Have you seen what is happening in Afghanistan? There is Isis, there is the Taliban. Of course we would go back if there was peace. Who wouldn’t want to go back to his home country? We would all return voluntarily.""

A police source estimates that up to 400 migrants are in Calais, and that 15 more are arriving each day, reported Le Figaro newspaper.
But rather than returning to the Jungle camp which has been fenced off, the new arrivals are spread out around town, some sleeping at the train station, reports say.
Police are kept busy in the area keeping an eye on the migrants, stopping them from entering the site of the Jungle, and stopping volunteers from lending a hand.
Gaël Manzi, a volunteer at refugee aid group Utopia 56, is among those who are discretely trying to help the migrants each night.
""There are many migrants who've been coming back to Calais since the beginning of January, and we're seeing mostly minors,"" he told The Local.
He estimated that there were between 60 and 80 minors in the area, and that the older migrants were more likely to keep out of site to avoid being taken away by police.
""The migrants aren't actually at the camp site, they're a bit all over the place, at the railway station, in the city centre,"" he said.
Manzi said his team works covertly during the nights - so as to avoid the police - and gives out sleeping bags and food.

Aid groups in the area have been calling for a basic emergency shelter to be set up in the area, particularly given the harsh winter temperatures, but their calls have fallen on deaf ears.
A proposal for a shelter for 20 people - which would be used as a short term solution before moving migrants on elsewhere, won the backing of aid groups and local prefect Jean Aribaud, but it, too, was ignored.
""It was a solid and realistic proposal which was not followed up by the government,"" Aribaud told Le Figaro.
Francois Guennoc, vice president of the Auberge des Migrants aid group, added that the government was ""in denial about the current situation in Calais."""

Calais port workers staged a go-slow Monday after Europe's longest rail motorway halted operations Monday over repeated efforts by migrants to break into trucks being transported to Britain.
The VIIA Britanica, a railway carrying unaccompanied trailers from Spain through France to Britain, decided to stop its services until September over a ""resurgence in migrant intrusions in past weeks,"" port authorities said in a statement.
The rail motorway -- which only went into operation in March -- allows road hauliers to cross France in 22 hours, avoiding 1,200 kilometres (745 miles) of roads.
However migrants living in the infamous camp known as the ""Jungle"" near the port of Calais try and break into the trailers as part of their desperate efforts to reach Britain.
Port workers and business owners launched the go-slow operation on a highway around Calais after the rail motorway stopped running.
""The situation keeps getting worse. We don't know what to do anymore to be heard,"" said Antoine Ravisse, president of a citizens' movement protesting the migrant crisis in the northern port.
""The migrants, some of whom are armed, climb into the trailers, they rip the tarpaulins. Our clients lose confidence in us, sometimes their merchandise is destroyed. The cost is enormous,"" he added.
Around 4,500 migrants, mainly from Afghanistan and Sudan, live in the Jungle camp, according to an official estimate."

Around 250 people joined a march on Saturday in Forges-les-Bains, about 30 kilometres southwest of Paris (see map below), against a migrant reception centre which opened Monday, housing 44 Afghans, an AFP journalist at the scene reported.
""The state forced this centre on us but I for one don't intend to just put up and shut up,"" said Lea, a young mother of two, who declined to give her surname.
Valerie Rigal, a leader of the marchers who are calling for a ""moratorium"" on further arrivals, insisted the villagers were not opposed to all migrants.
""We're not against migrants. We would have happily taken migrant families. What we didn't want was single men only,"" she said.
""My daughter takes the bus outside the centre every day. She's worried about running into groups of strange men.""
The leafy hamlet of 3,700 residents, surrounded by woodland and corn fields, is expected to receive 91 asylum seekers. They are to be accommodated in an imposing disused hospital surrounded by high fencing.

In Pierrefeu-du-Var, southern France, a disused part of a psychiatric hospital has been chosen by authorities to house 60 asylum seekers currently in Calais who will be relocated from November.
Opposition to that plan brought out some 600 people to a rally in the village about 20 kilometres from Hyeres near the Mediterranean coast, police said.
Patrick Martinelli, mayor of the village of 6,000 residents, with the local council voted against the state's plan to send 60 men to Pierrefeu-du-Var, arguing that ""a rural village was unsuitable for receiving such a population"".
The far-right National Front (FN) party later on Saturday afternoon staged in its own anti-migrant protest with around 650 supporters, according to police.
But not everyone agreed with the efforts to block the migrant centres.
Another demonstration in Pierrefeu-du-Var, organised by anti-far-right and leftist groups, took place with around 250 people carrying banners saying ""Yes, to solidarity and welcome for migrants and refugees,"" an AFP correspondent there reported.
Also in Forges-les-Bains onlookers at the anti-migrant protests criticised the demonstrators' attitude.
""It's shameful,"" said Jennifer Sandalian, who works in a retirement home, fighting back tears.
""We all have a role to play in welcoming migrants, as human beings. We have to show them another image of France.""
In Montpellier, southern France, around 100 protesters opposed to ""the migrant invasion"" and the ""Islamisation"" of the country were met by roughly the same number of anti-fascist demonstrators.
Riot police were deployed to separate the two groups.
And in Allex, south east France, 80 people gathered to protest the plans to resettle migrants currently in Calais across the country.
President Francois Hollande had announced during a visit to Calais last month that the makeshift camp which houses up to 10,000 people, would be dismantled by the end of the year and the asylum seekers relocated to centres around France."

sneakBeatrice Huret faces possible jail time if convicted of helping Mokhtar -- whom she met while volunteering at the since-demolished ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais -- slip out of France under cover of night, on a rickety boat.
The 45-year-old is one of several people around France who have been charged with illegally assisting migrants in recent months. While none have been imprisoned, a farmer was recently hit with a 3,000-euro ($3,300) fine.
Huret's lawyer told AFP she would ask the court in the coastal town of Boulogne-sur-Mer to dismiss the case, insisting her client acted for ""humanitarian reasons.""
She will be tried alongside three others accused of being part of a smuggling network, some of whose members allegedly acted for financial gain.

'Love at first sight'
Huret's journey from FN sympathiser to alleged people smuggler began on a cold day in February 2015 when she gave a lift to a young Sudanese migrant travelling to the squalid Jungle.
Before that, she had lived ""a basic life"" and voted FN like her husband, a border police officer who died of cancer in 2010.
Seeing the conditions in the Jungle gave her a new perspective on the plight of the thousands of migrants who flocked to Calais over the past decade in the hope of stowing away on a lorry bound for Britain.
""It was a shock to see all these people wading around in the mud,"" said Huret, a dark-haired woman with kohl-rimmed eyes, told AFP in an interview earlier this month.
She began volunteering at the camp soon afterwards and a year later met 37-year-old Mokhtar, who was among a group of Iranians who sewed their mouths shut in protest over the demolition of the southern half of the makeshift camp in March 2016.
When they first met, he spoke English but no French and her English was at best rudimentary. ""It was just 'hello, thank you, goodbye', so I didn't speak to him immediately,"" she said.
""He got up to get me some tea. You got a sense of someone who was very gentle, very calm and then his look... it was love at first sight,"" said Huret.
With the help of Google Translate the pair struck up a relationship and after a few months he came to stay with her, her 76-year-old mother and 19-year-old son while continuing to seeking passage to Britain.
After a failed bid to stow away on a lorry crossing the sea, Mokhtar enlisted her help in another, desperate plan.
She agreed to buy a small boat for 1,000 euros ($1,119) and on June 11, 2016 towed it to a beach from which he and two friends took off across the treacherous Channel.
The boat sprung a leak en route but the trio arrived safely after being rescued by the British coastguard.
Huret, however, soon found herself in trouble. Two months after the crossing, she was arrested and charged with being part of a migrant smuggling network.
Race for film rights
""I brought a boat to a beach. That's it. I did it out of love... I didn't profit from it,"" she wrote in ""Calais Mon Amour"", a book about their romance for which several film-makers are vying to acquire the rights.
The couple have kept up their relationship over the past year, with Huret regularly crossing the Channel to visit Mokhtar in the northern English city of Sheffield where the former teacher has obtained a work permit.
She is one of several people to appear in court in recent months charged with illegally assisting migrants who have travelled up through Europe after crossing the Mediterranean in flimsy boats or stowing away in trucks travelling overland from Turkey.
Since demolishing the Jungle camp in October French authorities have taken a stern line on illegal migration, accusing activists who provide assistance to homeless foreigners of creating a ""pull"" effect.
In February, a 37-year-old olive farmer in southern France was put on trial for helping African migrants cross the border from Italy and giving them accommodation.
Cedric Herrou was let off with a suspended fine of €3,000 ($3,300) but was re-arrested last week for continuing to assist migrants seeking shelter."

A spokesman for the residents, Bakary Cissoko, said the victim was a Malian man in his forties, who jumped from the third floor into a courtyard in an attempt to flee the blaze. ""He arrived in the shelter about four years ago,"" Cissoko said.
Another twelve people were injured, three seriously after jumping from the windows, police said.

Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve tweeted a message of solidarity with the migrants and vowed that all light would be shed on the incident.

On its website Coallia said the home, which also runs training programmes for migrants, has 328 beds.
In the past few months there have been several attacks on migrant shelters in France, mostly targeting centres for asylum seekers relocated from makeshift camps and squats in the northern port of Calais or Paris. But there had been no injuries or fatalities in those attacks.
On Friday, authorities cleared another of the migrant camps that keep sprouting up in or around Paris.
Around 300 migrants - mostly Afghans, Sudanese or Eritreans - had been living in the tented camp in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis.
The settlement was situated a few hundred metres from a new refugee transit centre set up by Paris city authorities to take asylum-seekers off the streets.
The centre only has space for 400 people at a time."

The extra security forces will ""ensure absolute respect for the control of the border,"" he added.
Late Saturday and early Sunday, activists from a small French far-right group blocked a key mountain pass some six kilometres from the Italian border which they say is a ""strategic point for illegal migrants"", prompting a furious reaction from pro-migrant activists.

On Sunday afternoon, a procession of French and Italian pro-migrant groups crossed the border at the Montgenevre Pass, alongside some 30 migrants, and had some minor scuffles with law enforcement officials on the way, a police source said.
The interior ministry said ""violence was committed against security forces and a gendarme vehicle was damaged"".
Thousands of young men from francophone west Africa have trudged across the mountains over the past two years, dreaming of jobs in France.
In recent months, as news about the route -- one of the lesser known on Europe's migrant trail -- filtered back to Africa, the arrivals have gained pace.
Most of those crossing the Alps in recent months have been from Guinea or Ivory Coast, both former French colonies.

Few have any hope of being granted refugee status, being considered economic migrants for fleeing a crippling lack of jobs and opportunities at home rather than war.
Collomb said the legislation passed Sunday aims for ""better controlled"" immigration, halving the waiting time for asylum applications to six months while also making it easier to deport those turned down as ""economic"" migrants.
However the legislation, criticised by rightwingers for being too soft and by leftwingers who see it as repressive, has exposed unprecedented divisions in President Emmanuel Macron's young centrist party."

Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, two-time winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, will soon begin shooting a movie touching on the migrants issue around the northern French port of Calais, local officials said on Wednesday.
Haneke and his team scouted the area in recent weeks with a view to start filming ""Happy End"" in early 2016, said Pictanovo, a group that organizes financing for films in the region.
Northern France has already made headlines in Hollywood this week after it was announced that blockbuster director Christopher Nolan, who made the recent Batman trilogy and ""Interstellar"", would soon film a World War II movie in Dunkirk.
Nolan's movie about the legendary evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk is due to start filming in May.
In recent years, thousands of migrants and refugees have ended up in squalid camps around the port in Calais as they try to make their way to Britain.
A spokesman for Pictanovo said migrants would not be the subject of Haneke's movie, but would be ""evoked and integrated in the issues of the film"".
Haneke recently joined over 5,000 other film professionals, including actress Juliette Binoche and director Costa-Gavras, in calling for a more robust response to the refugee crisis from Europe.
""Happy End"" will reunite stars Jean-Louis Trintignant and Isabelle Huppert from his last, Oscar-nominated, film ""Amour"".

Valls, who quit President Francois Hollande's government last month to stand as a candidate in the primary, was accused of only admitting a few thousand migrants during his time in office.
""I get the feeling that the French people were much more generous than their leaders,"" said Vincent Peillon, a former education minister who is considered an outsider in the contest.
Another candidate, Benoit Hamon, told Valls that France had a duty to ""show its values, especially when it comes to migrants and refugees"".
Valls hit back that ""an open-ended policy (of accepting migrants) is not possible"".
""I think France was right to follow this policy and history has proved us right,"" he added.
The influx of more than one million asylum seekers -- mostly from war-torn Syria -- into the European Union in 2015 triggered the worst refugee and migrant crisis on the continent since World War II.
France's EU heavyweight neighbour Germany opened its doors, bringing in 890,000 asylum seekers in that year alone and fueling debate about why other EU states could not take more.
Socialists face battle
The French political attacks showed once again that a week ahead of the first round of voting on January 22 followed by a runoff on January 29, Spanish-born Valls' campaign is struggling to take off.
A poll of TV viewers after the debate had Arnaud Montebourg, who served as economy minister in Hollande's government before quitting, as the most convincing of the seven candidates. He polled 29 percent, ahead of 26 percent for Valls.
With Hollande ruling out a bid to retain the presidency after a torrid five years in power dogged by unemployment and terror attacks, the Socialists are seeking a presidential candidate who can at least salvage some pride for the party.
Current projections show the Socialist candidate, whoever it is, crashing out in the first round of the election, as voters across Europe lean to the right or opt for anti-establishment and anti immigration parties like Marine Le Pen's National Front.
The majority of polls currently predict that conservative candidate Francois Fillon will face Le Pen in the decisive second round on May 7, although after Donald Trump's win in the United States and the victory of Brexit in Britain, no-one is taking anything for granted.
Looming large over the leftwing primary are Hollande's star former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and Communist-backed firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, both of whom are running for president outside of the primary system.
Macron, a 39-year-old former Rothschild banker who positions himself as ""neither of the right or the left"", drew a crowd of several thousand supporters when he held a rally in the northern city of Lille on Saturday."

It remains unknown where exactly how police will handle the migrants' relocation, but one thing remains clear - the migrants don't intend to stay in Paris. Indeed, the reason many chose to stay in the northern reaches of the city is for easy access to the Gare du Nord train station, from where trains head daily to Calais in northern France.
When The Local recently met with migrants at the camp, many said they were just waiting for the opportunity to take a train to Calais, which would just be another stop-off point on their way to the UK.

After reaching Calais, conditions aren't likely to get better for the migrants, most of whom come from Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia. There are an estimated 2,500 migrants living at a camp on wasteland at the edge of the city - dubbed by the migrants as The Jungle II.
One aid organisation recently told The Local that it is the “worst refugee camp in Europe”.
They also know the perils of trying to get across the Channel to the UK, with several migrants having been crushed under the wheels of lorries or having suffocated in their holds.

Regular confrontations
The notorious Jungle camp in Calais, once home to some 10,000 people hoping to make it to Britain, was demolished in 2016, but hundreds of migrants remain in the port city seeking to stow away on England-bound trucks.
A judicial source equated Thursday's unrest with that 2015, when the camp was created.
Those left in the area, most of them young Africans and Afghan men, have been living rough in the woods and clash regularly with police, who clear their encampments and stop them from setting up roadblocks in a bid to slow passing trucks.
Grim living conditions have led to regular confrontations between migrants of different nationalities, and five people were shot in a fight between rival Afghan groups last November.
Charities working with migrants in the area say around 800 are currently living in Calais, while local authorities put the numbers at 550 to 600.
Last month President Emmanuel Macron vowed zero tolerance for camps like the ""Jungle"" and secured a new border security deal which will see Britain pay more to stop migrants trying to reach its shores.
Macron has said he wants to step up expulsions of economic migrants while speeding up waiting times for asylum applications -- an approach he touts as mixing ""humanity"" and ""efficiency"".
But his tougher line has earned criticism from some of his allies, with his former senior aide Jean Pisani-Ferry among those signing a hard-hitting open letter claiming Macron risked betraying his image as a humanist."

""There is nothing left but a heap of ashes,"" Michel Lalande, prefect of France's Nord region, told reporters at the scene as firefighters continued to battle the flames which were visible from several kilometres (miles) away.

Lalande said the blaze had been started after a fight on Monday afternoon between Afghans and Kurds at the camp that had left six injured with knife wounds.
""There must have been fires deliberately set in several different places, it is not possible otherwise.

Plans to dismantle camp
Fights between the migrants continued after midnight, with riot police struggling to contain them and occasionally being pelted with stones, according to an AFP correspondent.
""No one is able to explain how these events could have happened,"" said Lalande.
The population of the Grande-Synthe camp has swelled since the destruction last October of the squalid ""Jungle"" camp near Calais, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away.
According to several witnesses, disagreements arose after an increase in the number of Afghans who arrived from the ""Jungle"" camp.
The Afghans were apparently unhappy at being put up in the communal kitchens while the Kurds slept in chalets.
Their arrival had increased tensions, according to Caremelle.
There have been several violent incidents at the Grande-Synthe camp, with police intervening last month after five men were injured in a fight.
Another man was stabbed in November.
French officials had said in mid-March that security forces were planning to start dismantling the camp following clashes at the site.
The camp, built by the humanitarian group MSF (Doctors Without Borders), opened in March 2016 over the objections of the central government.
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, with French authorities repeatedly tearing down camps in the region.
Migrants gather along the northern coast in France seeking to break into trucks heading to Britain or pay smugglers to help them get across the Channel.
The issue is a constant source of friction between Britain and France and an embarrassment for the French government, which has been criticised by the United Nations refugee agency for failing to provide adequate accommodation."

					08:49 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Exhausted migrants on France's Aquarius bear scars of the past,"The 141 migrants onboard the Aquarius rescue boat at the centre of Europe's latest migration drama, are exhausted and mentally scarred after harrowing journeys, according to an aid worker on the ship.
On Tuesday, five European countries agreed to take in the migrants to avoid another bitter dispute like the one in June when Italy and Malta turned the Aquarius away with 630 people onboard.
This time the Aquarius had been floating between Italy and Malta since carrying out two rescue missions off Libya on Friday -- the crew desperately worried the standoff would repeat itself.
""We've been on standby since 8:00 am yesterday (Monday), exactly halfway between Malta and Italy,"" said Aloys Vimard, a coordinator with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), one of two charities operating the ship.
Vimard, reached by telephone, said more than half of the passengers were minors -- 73 in total, of whom 67 were travelling alone.
""A quarter of those on the boat are between 13 and 15, unaccompanied, and from either Eritrea or Somalia,"" he told AFP.
Both Horn of Africa countries remain deeply troubled -- Somalia torn by violence among militias, Islamists and criminal gangs, while repressive Eritrea maintains an indefinite military service that has been likened to slavery by the United Nations.
While the bulk of the youngsters onboard the Aquarius are teenagers, Vimard said they were ""still vulnerable.""
On Monday the crew organised a basketball match for the youngsters which briefly took their minds off their situation, he said.
""They have experienced such ordeals that they have impressive maturity and incredible resistance,"" he added.
One of the teenagers, a 13-year-old boy, fled Somalia after his parents were killed in front of him.
Like many, he spoke of horrendous abuse after making his way to lawless Libya, ""tortured for months with electric shocks"".
""He eventually got released because he asked the guards to kill him to end it all,"" said Vimard.
'Contempt' for human lives
The crew had spent the last 24 hours, stranded at sea, attempting to reassure the migrants.
""We told them we'd do everything possible to find a place,"" Vimard said. ""That we wouldn't leave them.""
After the standoff in June, which eventually ended when Spain allowed the boat to land, the Aquarius docked in the southern French port of Marseille for a month of maintenance work.
Vimard said its upgraded facilities were a reflection of the fact that people were now spending more time onboard.
Before the arrival in June of Rome's new populist government, which says it has had enough of taking in migrant ships, there was no shower as passengers were usually just aboard for two days before disembarking in Italy.
Now all passengers shower systematically while other procedures have been changed to help prevent the spread of disease, Vimard said.
While the Aquarius crew is determined to keep picking up people they say would drown otherwise, Vimard fears governments will repeatedly turn them away, prompting standoff after standoff.
""The question now is how many times politicians are going to hold human lives in contempt,"" he said, urging the European Union to ""find a decent system to avoid managing rescues on a case-by-case basis"".
He accused European politicians of ""discouraging the captains of rescue boats from rescuing people in distress, which is their duty as sailors"".
""It is terrible. It is the very nature of maritime rescue that is being called into question,"" Vimard said.
By the time the Aquarius reached one of the two boats whose passengers were rescued Friday, five ships had already passed by and done nothing to help them, he said.
These ships ""changed course"" despite the boat ""being clearly in distress, wooden, unstable and overloaded.""
After the first dispute over the Aquarius, EU countries agreed to explore several new policies in a bid to cut off the influx towards Europe.
But ""if we put up more barriers, people will take bigger and bigger risks,"" Vimard said."

					11:35 CET+01:00				",AFP,France moves migrant youths from razed 'Jungle' camp,"Around 1,500 unaccompanied minors living near the demolished ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais are being moved to reception centres around France on Wednesday.
French authorities on Wednesday started moving out the remaining 1,500 unaccompanied children living next to the razed ""Jungle"" migrant camp in Calais to shelters around the country.
A first bus carrying 43 minors left the area around 8:30 am (0730 GMT) for the southwest, rapidly followed by a second one.
More than 30 buses have been deployed to transfer the minors to 60 centres nationwide.
The dismantling of the informal part of the camp that once housed up to 10,000 migrants, most of whom hoped to reach Britain, was completed on Monday night.
Over 4,000 adults who had been living in tents and shacks -- mainly Afghans, Eritreans and Sudanese -- were moved to reception centres across France last week, before the bulldozers moved in.
That left nearly 1,500 underage migrants, who stayed behind in a secure container park run by an NGO, and around 400 women and children living in a separate care facility a few hundred metres away.
The plight of the unaccompanied children has been the subject of testy exchanges between France and Britain.
France is hoping that Britain will take in most of the unaccompanied minors who travelled alone across the Mediterranean and up through Europe, in the hope of stowing away on trucks crossing the Channel to England.
After initially dragging its heels on the issue, Britain in mid-October speeded up the transfer of child refugees.
In the past two weeks it has taken in around 300 children with family or contacts across the Channel and promised to take hundreds more.
Some aid agencies have warned that scattering the children around France could hold up that process.
French authorities have assured that the minors still be able to pursue their dream of Britain from the far-flung shelters to which they are sent.
""No further transfer applications will be handled in Calais,"" an official document circulated among the teens Tuesday read.
The lure of Calais
France's Socialist government had been under pressure to move the remaining minors out of Calais, to avoid the re-emergence of a new shanty town.
Various squalid settlements have existed for decades around the city, which is home to one of the country's biggest ports and the Channel Tunnel rail link connecting France and Britain.
Over the past year the Jungle had mushroomed in size as hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Middle East and Africa poured into Europe.
Speaking to La Voix du Nord local newspaper Tuesday President Francois Hollande vowed there would be ""no new settlement"" on the site of the Jungle.
""It has been evacuated. It will be secured. No-one else will be able to move there,"" he said.
Some minors fear that being moved away from the Channel coast will diminish their chances of making it to Britain.
""Around half"" of the under-18s moved to children's shelters in eastern and western France last week had already slipped away, the head of the France Terre d'Asile charity, Pierre Henry, said.
""They want to return to Calais,"" he said."

UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said the agency was deeply worried, especially for children who were living there alone or had become separated from their families.
Conditions in the camps are ""appalling"" and ""very unsanitary,"" Spindler said.
""Children are very vulnerable to any exploitation. We know that people smugglers are present in these sites,"" he said.
Nearly 4,000 migrants live in a makeshift camp dubbed ""The Jungle"" on the outskirts of Calais, hoping to smuggle themselves across to Britain on trains or lorries.
Almost 2,000 others live in a second squalid camp, the Grande-Synthe, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away.
The French authorities are providing lodging for particularly vulnerable migrants and setting up containers in ""The Jungle"" able to house 1,500 people.
Shelters are also being built, to international standards, at the Grande-Synthe site.
The UNHCR said it ""would welcome"" the creation of additional reception places for children, and called on authorities to urgently look at ways of beefing up protection, ""particularly for those children with relatives in another EU state."""

The roughly 80 activists blocked off two bridges close to the city centre and burned tyres, waved banners and set off smoke bombs, police and officials said.
Riot police broke up the demonstration and seized a truck transporting equipment for the group.
While surrounded by officers, some protesters carried banners saying “No Way” and “Go Home,” according to photos and video of the protest posted on Twitter.
A press release from the far-right group — Generation Identitaire — said about 130 activists took control of “three bridges that allowed migrants to access the city of Calais.”
This incident comes after five men posing as police officers were detained on Friday on suspicion of attacking migrants in Calais.
A police source said the attackers used iron bars and pickaxe handles, saying the men went repeatedly to Calais to attack migrants.
Four other people were arrested on February 22 and charged with participating in attacks several months ago on migrants near the infamous Calais camp known as the “Jungle”.
Thousands of migrants have been living in the Jungle and other smaller camps along the northern coast, desperate to reach Britain where many have family or community ties and see better hopes of gaining employment or education."

					09:53 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,"'Up to 1,000' migrants still missing after blaze destroys camp in northern France","After a massive blaze reduced the Grande-Synthe migrant camp to ashes, up to 1,000 migrants are still missing, according to reports.
The huge fire gutted one of France's biggest migrant camps, which housed 1,500 people. It started after a brawl involving hundreds of Afghans and Kurds, officials and police said Tuesday.
The Grande-Synthe facility near the northern French port of Dunkirk was the only one in the area and provided hundreds of wooden huts for shelter, as well as cooking facilities and showers.
Three gymnasiums were provided for the displaced migrants, but only around 500 were actually taken in, according to Corenne Torre, head of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders for France.
In other words, around 1,000 are still unaccounted for, she told The Local on Wednesday morning.
""Of course I'm worried and I'm absolutely convinced that most of them will come back to Paris, which will only cause more problems there,"" Torre said.
""This is not a good situation and many of them may be in danger. Those that stay in Grande-Synthe are left walking along the roads where some have been hit by passing cars,"" she added.
""Many of them don't speak French and many are with minors as young as 14. We don't know what will happen to them.""
She said that some of the migrants may be in hiding for fear of being put together with members of rival gangs.
As most of the migrants are looking to move through to the UK, they often aren't interested in the refugee centre in La Chappelle in Paris, meaning that they tend to stay on the streets.
""Then the police will intervene to keep them off the streets, and then we will see more tensions. These people want to go to the UK, they are in transit,"" she said.
The camp in Grande-Synthe itself has largely been destroyed, with only around 70 of 300 huts and a handful of communal buildings still intact on Tuesday morning. The others were smoldering embers or burned beyond repair, along with their contents.
The camp, built by the humanitarian group MSF (Doctors Without Borders), opened in March 2016 over the objections of the central government, which announced plans to close it in March.
Scramble for other accommodation
For more than a decade France's northern coast has been a magnet for refugees and migrants trying to reach Britain, causing tension between the two neighbours.
Ahead of the presidential election in two weeks' time, the fire quickly became a campaign issue, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen saying it underlined the need to control immigration.
""This chaos must stop,"" she said. ""All migrants' camps will be dismantled after my election if the French people elect me as head of state.""
Her main rival for the presidency, Emmanuel Macron, has pledged to scrap a treaty with Britain under which France has secured its northern border to stop migrants crossing the narrow Channel sea.
""We will need to take up discussions with Britain again on the situation which leaves us acting as border guards for this country,"" the secretary general of Macron's party, Richard Ferrand, told the LCI channel."

Since the end of July, police have carried out over twenty operations to evacuate camps in the 19th arrondissement, where many camps have sprung up. During some of these evacuations, riot police were drafted in to help and police turned tear gas on the migrants.
Nearly 80,000 people applied for asylum in France in 2015, but it has been affected less than its European neighbours by the mass influx of migrants over the last 18 months.
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo pledged at the end of May that the city would get a humanitarian camp, built to UN standards, in the coming months."

launched a joint operation Monday to block off main routes in and out of
Calais to call for the closure of the vast ""Jungle"" migrant camp there.
French farmers and truckers blocked the main routes in and out of the port of Calais on Monday to call for the
closure of the sprawling ""Jungle"" migrant camp.
Around 70 trucks mounted a ""go-slow"" on the A16 motorway -- the main artery for freight and passengers heading for Britain either via the Channel Tunnel or on board ferries from the port.
Under a light drizzle, the trucks were joined by a line of farmers on their tractors, bringing to a near-standstill the route used by trucks from all over Europe to reach Calais.
Despite the large tailbacks, many motorists passing the other way sounded their horns in support.
""We've had no answers, so we're blocking things up,"" said Frederic Van Gansbeke, who represents businesses and shop-owners in Calais.
The Jungle, a squalid camp of makeshift tents and shelters, is home to some 7,000 migrants but charities say the number might be as high as 10,000 after an influx this summer.
Migrants from the camp often use tree branches to create road blocks to slow trucks heading for Britain, their destination of choice.
When the trucks slow down, migrants try to clamber into the trailers to stow away aboard.
Angry drivers say migrants have attacked their vehicles with metal bars and that the overstretched police are unable to protect them.
Nicolas Lotin, who runs a logistics company in nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, said: ""Every day, we have to wonder whether our working day will be ruined, whether a migrant will sneak under the truck's canvas.
""If the goods are damaged, they have to be immediately transported back to the home depot,"" he said.
""This demonstration is to shout loud and clear about how fed up road hauliers are,"" said David Sagnard, head of the local branch of the National Federation of Road Hauliers.
""What we're calling for today are security measures so we can drive completely safely on the A16 motorway and on the port road,"" he added.
Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart, who has frequently clashed with the government over the Jungle, joined the protest wearing an ""I love Calais"" T-shirt.
The mayor claims the camp may soon contain as many as 15,000 migrants if authorities take several months to dismantle it.
Organisers said they hoped that up to 500 people would join a ""human chain"" protest in the town's stadium later Monday.
'As soon as possible'
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve promised during a visit to the Jungle on Friday to close the camp down ""as quickly as possible"" but said it would be done in stages.
Disgruntled Calais residents want the authorities to set a date for the entire camp to be cleared.
Bars and restaurants in Calais -- which is also the main gateway to France for millions of British holidaymakers -- say their trade has been severely hit by the presence of the Jungle.
Business owners want compensation from the state for lost income.
France has made repeated efforts to close the Jungle.
Earlier this year, authorities cleared shelters in parts of the site in a bid to persuade migrants to move into more permanent accommodation or camps elsewhere on France's northern coast.
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is bidding to secure the right-wing nomination to win back the presidency next year, has called for Britain to take responsibility for the migrants over the Channel.
Last week France and Britain pledged to work together to increase security at the port of Calais and to improve the humanitarian situation for the Jungle's residents.
But the British government has dismissed as a ""complete non-starter"" a proposal by Xavier Bertrand, the president of the region that includes Calais, to allow migrants to lodge British asylum claims on French soil.
The population of the Jungle include large numbers of Sudanese, Afghan, Somali and Syrian residents.

police on both sides braced for new attempts at the crossing.
The EC said in a statement that it would send a first instalment of financial assistance to France of €20 million ($22 million), less than a day after some 600 fresh attempts were made to penetrate the tunnel, according to a police source.
The situation in the northern French port of Calais has hit the headlines in the past week, with people desperate to reach Britain making attempt after attempt to breach Eurotunnel defences, some paying for it with their lives.
Last week, a Sudanese man in his 30s died, apparently crushed to death by a lorry, and at least 10 people have been killed since June trying to get to Britain where many already have family and work is perceived as easier to find.
The EC's Migration and Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the first instalment of a special grant would now be sent to help Paris deal with its side of the crisis.
Britain has already received €27 million.
""This comes from the total of over €266 million earmarked for France and over €370 million earmarked for the UK for the period covering 2014-20,"" Avramopoulos said in a statement.
The EC also offered the two countries its technical assistance, including help to process asylum applications through a support office.
""The European Borders Agency, Frontex, can help identify and register migrants, collaborate with countries of origin and transit to speed up the issuing of travel documents for return, and coordinate and finance joint return operations,"" it added.
'Solidarity, responsibility'
A police source said earlier Tuesday some 500 migrants had been seen overnight next to the Channel Tunnel site near Calais, and of the 600 attempts they made to enter, around 400 were repelled by authorities.
Of the other 200 people, 180 were caught within the site and removed and a further 20 were arrested.
Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, was also inspecting a section of one of the undersea tunnels for an ""anomaly"" that was causing delays earlier Tuesday, the group said, though traffic returned to normal later in the day.
The crisis in Calais has become a cross-Channel political hot potato and has seen French police bolster their presence in Calais with 120 additional officers.
British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government on Monday announced new measures to crack down on illegal immigrants, came under fire last week for comments in which he referred to ""swarms"" of people seeking to get into the country.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, meanwhile, has urged Britain to do more to help with the crisis.
But commissioner Avramopoulos warned the Calais crisis is ""another stark example of the need for a greater level of solidarity and responsibility in the way we deal with migratory pressures in Europe"".
""We are facing a migratory crisis of extraordinary proportions that is very much linked to the conflicts occurring in the wider periphery of Europe,"" he said.
""We must act in a united way to address a challenge that surpasses national boundaries,"" he added."
