					08:32 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy's Salvini in Libya as migrants disembark Danish cargo ship,"Italy's new government took its fight to block migrants to Libya on Monday as a new boat with hundreds on board remained stranded at sea, deepening a crisis shaking Europe.
With European leaders at each other's throats over the large number of migrants arriving from North Africa, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini paid a surprise visit to Tripoli.
There, he called for the establishment of processing centres in various unnamed African countries to deal with potential migrants in a move ""to help Libya as well as Italy block migration"".
Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.
Salvini's unexpected trip came a day after emergency talks between 16 European Union leaders in a bid to break a longstanding deadlock over who should take in the migrants, the bulk of whom have been landing in Italy and Greece.
The crisis came to a head earlier this month when Italy's new populist government turned away a rescue boat carrying 630 people, which was also rejected by Malta, forcing the vessel to remain at sea until Spain offered them safe haven.
But the relief was short-lived, with Italy and Malta refusing a second vessel carrying 234 migrants who were rescued on Thursday.
The move left Germany-operated rescue boat Lifeline stranded in international waters near Malta.
""Let's see if Europe remembers that it actually exists because there is still a boat loaded with migrants in Maltese waters waiting for a port to welcome it and we can tell you again, it won't be in an Italian port,"" Salvini said.
However a Danish cargo ship owned by Maersk, the world's leading container shipping company, with 108 migrants on board was allowed to dock at the southern Sicilian port of Pozzalo after waiting offshore for three days for instructions from the Italian authorities.
A tugboat pulled the ship into the harbour at around 11pm, an AFP reporter said.
It had changed course early Friday to help 113 people off of Libya, of whom five including four children and a pregnant woman disembarked in Sicily.
Danish Immigration Minister Inger Støjberg, herself a hardliner on immigration, said earlier she would send a letter to Salvini to ask him to act on their situation.

Ramping up the rhetoric, Salvini earlier warned foreign charities to stop rescuing migrants off Libya, accusing them of ""causing trouble"" and saying Italian ports ""are and will be closed to those who aid human traffickers.""
His remarks came as Libya's coastguard said it had rescued nearly a 1,000 people on Sunday, and Spanish authorities said they had picked up more than 600 others off their coast on Monday.
Salvini has insisted Italy will not take in ""one more"" refugee, vowing to close its ports to all foreign-flagged rescue ships and demanding that Europe shoulder the burden, warning the migration crisis could threaten the bloc's future.
""We will jointly support, with Libyan authorities, the setting up of reception and identification centres south of Libya, on the external border of Libya, to help Libya as well as Italy block migration,"" Salvini told a news conference in Tripoli.
Ahmed Maiteeq, deputy head of the Government of National Accord (GNA), said Libya would host a migration summit in September.
Earlier, he told Italy's La Repubblica daily that Europe ""must think of structural measures to take in African countries to stop migrants.""
On his return to Rome, Salvini said a technical team would be set up this week with representatives from Italy, Niger, Chad and Mali.
He dismissed calls by France and Spain for asylum-seekers to be kept in closed centres until their claims are processed -- a proposal Rome fears would turn Italy into ""a refugee camp for all of Europe"".
""Welcome hotspots in Italy? It would be a problem for us and for Libya itself because it would not stop these deadly waves (of migration). We have proposed reception centres south of Libya to avoid Tripoli becoming a funnel, like Italy,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""The only way to really counteract the traffickers' criminal interests and avoid these voyages of death is to stop these boats putting out to sea,"" he added in a separate statement.
The crisis has seen France's Emmanuel Macron accusing Rome of ""irresponsibility"" for turning away the boats, and Italy denouncing Paris for its hypocrisy in pushing migrants back across their shared border.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing an ultimatum from her hardline interior minister who has given her until the end of June to find a European deal to curb new arrivals.
Sunday's emergency EU leaders meeting had aimed to clear the air between member states ahead of a scheduled full summit on Thursday and Friday.
Both Macron and Merkel have vowed to forge ahead with like-minded leaders on ways to reduce migrant flows, but the EU's top migration official warned that Europe would solve the crisis only by working together.
""We must find a way to adopt a shared policy and a shared strategy to face this situation, otherwise the European project is in danger,"" Dimitris Avramopoulos told AFP on a visit to Tehran.

					08:15 CET+01:00				",Sören Billing/AFP,Denmark passes controversial bill to take migrants' valuables,"Despite widespread condemnation, Denmark's parliament on Tuesday approved drastic reforms curbing asylum seekers' rights, including delaying family reunifications and confiscating migrants' valuables.
The bill presented by the right-wing minority government of Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen was approved by a huge majority of 81 of the 109 lawmakers present, as members of the opposition Social Democrats backed the measures.
The bill was watered down significantly since it was originally proposed, with wedding rings and low-value items explicitly excluded from threat of confiscation in the final draft.
Approval had been widely expected, as the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, backed the measures as did government support parties the Danish People's Party, the Conservatives and Liberal Alliance.
""There's no simple answer for a single country, but until the world comes together on a joint solution (to the migrant crisis), Denmark needs to act,"" MP Jakob Ellemann-Jensen of Rasmussen's Venstre party said during the debate.
The Danish government has insisted the new law is needed to stem the flow of refugees even though Denmark and Sweden recently tightened their borders, a move that prompted Germany and Austria to turn back new arrivals heading for Scandinavia.
While international outrage has focused on a proposal allowing police to seize cash and valuables from refugees to help pay for their stay in asylum centres, rights activists have blasted a proposed three-year delay for family reunifications which they say breaches international conventions.

'What is the alternative?'
Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen of the right-wing Venstre party has shrugged off criticism by calling it ""the most misunderstood bill in Denmark's history"", seemingly more concerned with opinion polls that show 70 percent of Danes rank immigration as their top political concern.
Social Democrat Dan Jørgensen addressed opponents of the bill, demanding: ""To those saying what we are doing is wrong, my question is: What is your alternative?
""The alternative is that we continue to be (one of) the most attractive countries in Europe to come to, and then we end up like Sweden.""
Copenhagen has often referred to neighbouring Sweden as a bad example, where 163,000 asylum applications were submitted last year -- five times more than in Denmark relative to their population size.
Denmark's minority government eventually backtracked on parts of the plan to confiscate migrants' valuables in order to secure wider backing.
Asylum-seekers will now have to hand over cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (€1,340, $1,450) and any individual items valued at more than that amount, up from the initial 3,000 kroner proposed.
After thorny negotiations with the other parties, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg agreed to exempt wedding rings and other items of sentimental value.
The government points out that Danes seeking to qualify for social benefits sometimes also have to sell their valuables. However, they are not subjected to the kind of searches proposed in the new asylum law.
Some have likened the Danish proposals to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
The plan has ""a particularly bitter connotation in Europe, where the Nazis confiscated large amounts of gold and other valuables from Jews and others,"" The Washington Post wrote.

'Just plain wrong'
Once a champion of refugee rights, the Scandinavian country's goal is now to become ""significantly less attractive for asylum-seekers"", Støjberg said.
""The tone in the public debate about refugees and immigrants has undoubtedly become tougher,"" Kashif Ahmad, the leader of the National Party (Nationalpartiet), which hopes to enter parliament by targeting the immigrant vote, told AFP.
John Dalhuisen, Europe and Central Asia director at Amnesty International, said the law was ""plain wrong"" and ""a sad reflection of how far Denmark has strayed"" from its historic support of international norms in the Refugee Convention.
""European states must stop this dismal race to the bottom and begin to meet their international obligations, by upholding refugees' human rights and dignity,"" said Dalhuisen. ""Anything less is a betrayal of our common humanity.""
But Marcus Knuth, Venstre's spokesman on integration issues, said such criticism was unfair.
""Denmark continues to be one of the most welcoming and caring places that you can seek asylum in. So the criticism that all of a sudden we were doing something wrong we find highly, highly unfair,"" he told AFP.
""We simply wish to be put more at par with other European countries so that we are not one of the countries that receive by far the most asylum-seekers.""
International criticism
Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants but putting it far behind the 163,000 registered in neighbouring Sweden.
International criticism had mounted in the run-up to Tuesday's vote, with refugee agency UNHCR claiming it violates the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Refugee Convention.
But Rasmussen, whose Venstre party won a June 2015 election after promising an ""immediate slowdown"" of Denmark's refugee influx, has been unfazed, arguing that the UN Refugee Convention may need to be changed if refugees keep pouring into Europe.
Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen defended the new law last week as he appeared before the United Nations for a review of Denmark's human rights policies.
""The Danish welfare state is based upon the very simple principle that the state will provide and pay for those unable to take care of themselves, not for those who are able,"" he told the Human Rights Council.
He and Støjberg reiterated the same line as they faced questioning from European MPs in the civil liberties committee on Monday.
Twenty-seven MPs voted against the bill in the one-chamber parliament, including three dissenting Social Democrats. A legislator for Greenland, a Danish territory, abstained and 70 MPs did not take part.
The bill is scheduled to be signed into law by Queen Margrethe within a few days.
Danish lawmakers last week also passed a resolution pushing the government to look into the consequences of building temporary housing complexes outside cities for refugees, like the country did during the Balkans war in the 1990s.
The move is backed by the anti-immigration Danish People's Party, which sees it as a first step towards building state-run camps where refugees would stay without integrating into Danish society."

					08:53 CEST+02:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Italy’s refusal of Maersk migrants 'unreasonable': Denmark’s immigration minister,"Danish minister for immigration Inger Støjberg says that Italy must accept migrants rescued by shipping company Maersk.
The Italian government has refused to accept migrants rescued from the Mediterranean Sea but reportedly asked a ship belonging to Danish freight company Maersk to rescue 113 people on Saturday.
Støjberg, herself an immigration hardliner, told broadcaster DR that the position of the Italian government was “unsustainable” and “unreasonable”.
“It is unreasonable towards Maersk to put them in a situation in which they have a ship full of migrants, not least migrants whom they have been asked to help by the authorities, and this is therefore a question in which the Italians certainly should allow them to be brought to an Italian harbour,” she said.
The Alexander Maersk rescued 113 people on Saturday. Five were subsequently brought to land at the request of the Italian coastguard, Ritzau reports.
But the ship has not been granted permission to dock in Italy and therefore has nowhere to take the rescued migrants.
Denmark’s prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has previously stated that Italy must comply with its international obligations.
Støjberg will write to Italy’s deputy PM Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, one of two populist parties now dominating Italy’s parliament, on Monday, according to DR.
“We cannot take in any more, not one. On the contrary. We want to have fewer,” Salvini said to German news magazine Der Spiegel on Friday.
Until it is given a place to dock, the Maersk ship is incurring costs for as long as it is unable to follow its intended sailing route.
“This is costing Maersk a lot of money with every hour their ship is off the coast without being able to unload the migrants, so this must [be resolved] quickly,” Støjberg told DR.

Six members of the Danish parliament's Immigration and Integration Affairs Committee will leave on Saturday for Australia and Nauru, Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the leftist Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) told AFP, confirming reports in Danish media.
Schmidt-Nielsen said that although she found the Australian system ""grotesque"", the trip -- planned for several months -- was a chance for her to ""ask some of the questions that the Australian government is preventing journalists from asking.""
The release of more than 2,000 leaked reports of incidents on Nauru detailing allegations of widespread abuse and self-harm, including children wanting to kill themselves, have renewed calls for a parliamentary inquiry in Australia.
But the Nauruan government said last week that asylum-seekers had made up most of the claims in hope of being relocated to Australia.
Under Canberra's immigration policy, asylum-seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are turned back or sent to detention centres in other countries, Nauru and Papua New Guinea
The chairman of the Danish parliamentary committee, Martin Henriksen of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DF), has previously described the Australian policy as being ""very sensible"".
The ruling Venstre party's hardline integration minister, Inger Støjberg, is not on the committee, but has said that the Australian system ""apparently works in an Australian context"" and that her government would ""continually consider... experiences from other countries.""
The Australian government said on August 17th that it had agreed to close the Papua New Guinea camp.
The Guardian, which published the Nauru reports, said that only two Australian journalists had been granted access to the Nauru detention centre in the past three years.
The Danish government rules with the help of the anti-immigration DF in parliament and has passed tough legislation to deter migrants from coming to the country, including allowing police to confiscate some of the asylum seekers' valuables to help pay for their accommodation."

Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the leftist Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) and Jacob Mark of the Socialist People's Party (SF) had both criticised Canberra's use of offshore settlements for asylum seekers and conditions at the Nauru camp before travelling to Australia last week.
""After the Danish foreign ministry got involved in the case, Nauru authorities said on Tuesday that the decision (to deny access) remained in force,"" Schmidt-Nielsen wrote on Facebook.
A Danish foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the information to AFP.
The entire delegation then decided to cancel its visit to the island, even though lawmakers from the Social Democrats, the centre-right Venstre party and the anti-immigration Danish People's Party would have been able to go.
""It is absolutely unacceptable and anti-democratic and says everything about the situation in Nauru that critics are denied access,"" Schmidt-Nielsen added.
A third lawmaker who had not voiced any criticism against the Nauru immigration centre -- Naser Khader of the Conservative People's Party -- was also denied access.
While Danish media speculated that his application to join the tour may have come too late, Schmidt Nielsen suggested that his Arab name may have played a part in the decision.
Under Canberra's immigration policy, asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are turned back or sent to detention centres in the Pacific island states of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.
The release of more than 2,000 leaked reports of incidents on Nauru earlier this month revealed allegations of widespread abuse and self-harm, including children wanting to kill themselves, and renewed calls by rights groups for refugees to be resettled elsewhere.

Denmark’s employment minister, Henrik Dam Kristensen, said he was happy to see the European Court of Justice rule on Tuesday that EU member states have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants. The ruling was prompted after a Romanian woman living in Germany was denied unemployment benefits when she didn't take up jobs suggested by her local job centre. The woman, 25-year-old Elisabeta Dano, appealed her case all the way to the European Court. The court ruled on Tuesday that states must have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants, a position that has been held by Denmark. See also: Court: EU migrants can be denied local benefits Kristensen said that the ruling supports what Denmark has said all along: that EU residents should not be allowed to travel from country to country looking for social benefits. “Denmark supported Germany in the case because we don’t believe that one should have the right to move from one EU country to the other with the sole intention of being taken care of. Therefore we weren’t surprised by the outcome,” Kristensen said in a statement. “Even though experts will now closely inspect and asses the scope of the EU ruling, I am basically very satisfied with it,” he added. Danish MEPs also praised the court’s decision. “I think this is an expression of a new understanding within the EU system that a country’s concerns need to be met and that we must clearly say no to welfare tourism,” the Social Democrats’ Jeppe Kofod said in a statement. Morten Messerschmidt, who represents the EU-sceptic Danish People's Party in Brussels, prodded the Danish government to act domestically. “I’m happy to see that the EU court has set a limit for which social benefits can be covered by EU law. It is therefore essential that the government do everything it can to ensure that all Danish benefits are also defended - just like the German ones,” Messerschmidt said in a statement. Denmark provided a submission to the European Court of Justice in support of the German authorities in the Dano case."

					16:20 CEST+02:00				",Michael Barrett,Racism plays a role in migrants’ exclusion in Denmark: report,"Anti-migrant political discourses and exclusionary migration policies are having a disproportionate and harmful impact on migrants, including in Denmark, according to a new report by NGO European Network Against Racism (ENAR).
The report, which covers 26 EU countries, says that migrants across the block are increasingly the targets of racist violence and speech and face discriminatory policies and attitudes hindering their access to the labour market.
Racist attacks against migrants, barriers in the labour market and ethnic profiling and discriminatory policing of migrants are all mentioned by the report as being part of the increasingly difficult situation faced by newcomers to EU countries.
Danish incidents cited as evidence of the trend include nationalist Danish People’s Party MP Martin Henriksen telling an 18-year-old high school student, who was born in Denmark to a Danish mother and Iranian father, during a TV debate that he did not automatically consider him to be Danish.
""You can't jump to the conclusion that you are Danish, just because you are born and raised in Denmark, speak Danish, and study at a Danish school. That is just absurd,"" Henriksen said during the debate.
By making such a statement, Henriksen excluded Danish citizens with a foreign background from the Danish national identity, concluded the report, stating that “the typical markers of what would traditionally be one’s national identity such as birth place, language, education were not enough and racial and cultural heritage was the defining factor used for exclusion in this instance.”

A second example taken from Danish cultural and political life is the advertisements placed by immigration minister Inger Støjberg in Lebanese newspapers telling refugees not to come to Denmark.
Significant cuts to social benefits for refugees have also been made since Støjberg’s Venstre (Liberal) party returned to government following the 2015 election.
“Since the election in June 2015, the new Danish government cut benefits to asylum seekers and migrants by up to 50%, with the purpose of making Denmark less attractive for refugees. Foreigners' retirement pension and child benefits have also been changed. This means that access to social benefits is now dependent on the length of residence in Denmark,” says the report.
The report also cites the case of an asylum seeker who was severely assaulted by a three masked men, an arson attack on a bus used by the inhabitants of an asylum centre, and three incidents in which threatening graffiti was sprayed on asylum centres’ walls.
Using results from the last two general elections, the increased percentage of the popular vote gained by the Danish People’s Party was cited by the report as an example of what it calls “Electoral success for political parties using xenophobic/racist ideas and policies”.

“The European Union and political leaders must stop the vicious circle of exclusion and hate and focus on long-term solutions to address hate crime and discrimination targeting migrants. At a deeper level, we need to question the racial biases underpinning European and national migration policies in order to ensure the real inclusion and participation of migrants in European society,” ENAR Chair Amel Yacef said in a press statement.
Georgina Siklossy, senior communications officer with ENAR, told The Local there is a risk of toughening policies against migration and xenophobia feeding off each other, including in Denmark.

“Restrictive policies and anti-migrant discourses contribute to an overall negative climate of hostility towards migrants, which can then legitimise discrimination, racist abuse or, in some cases, attacks targeting migrants,” Siklossy said via email.
“Policies and discourses portraying migrants as a 'problem' have an impact on public perceptions of migrants and also on people who have lived in Denmark or Europe for two, three or more generations and continue to be regarded as ‘alien elements',"" she added."

A new law to delay family reunifications, confiscate migrants' valuables and make already stringent permanent residency requirements even tougher went through its final reading in parliament on Thursday.
Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen was coincidentally to appear before the UN in Geneva later on Thursday for a review of Denmark's human rights policies, a routine procedure for UN member states but where the migrant bill was expected to arise.
In Copenhagen, the Danish speaker of parliament presented the bill Thursday in its final form to the assembly for its second reading, and was a last chance for lawmakers to demand changes.
Just one request was presented and swiftly rejected by legislators, as a majority have already agreed to back the bill in its existing form following thorny negotiations.
""The big legislative work... has already been done,"" said University of Copenhagen political science professor Kasper Moller Hansen said of Thursday's expeditious procedure.
As a result, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's minority right-wing government, supported in parliament by an anti-immigration far-right party that has for 15 years dictated increasingly restrictive immigration policies, is assured of winning a January 26 parliamentary vote.
Fearing a domino effect across Europe, the UN refugee agency UNHCR has decried the bill, saying it ""could fuel fear (and) xenophobia"".
Once a champion of refugees' rights, Denmark would be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Refugee Convention, the UNHCR concluded in a January report.
Unfazed, Copenhagen maintains it is not able to finance more migrants nor integrate them into society.
""Denmark's immigration policy is decided in Denmark, not in Brussels,"" Integration Minister Inger Støjberg has repeatedly said.
Seizing valuables
The confiscation of migrants' valuables has been the reform that has dominated international headlines.
The bill allows Danish authorities to seize asylum seekers' cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than 10,000 kroner. Wedding rings and other items of sentimental value are exempt.
Legal experts have however voiced more alarm over the measures making it harder to obtain family reunifications and residency permits.
Copenhagen wants to increase from one year to three years the waiting period for war refugees before they can apply to bring over their family members.
""According to the European Court of Human Rights, the processing of family reunification cases must be expeditious, flexible and efficient with special attention and care,"" the director of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, Jonas Christoffersen, told AFP.
""This is not consistent with a three-year waiting period.""
Amnesty International's deputy director for Europe, Gauri van Gulik, denounced a ""discriminatory practice"" in singling out refugees already traumatised by war.
Undeterred, Rasmussen has suggested Denmark may seek a revision of the UN Refugee Convention if the migrant crisis ""continues or gets worse"".
A foreign affairs spokesman for his Venstre party, Michael Aastrup Jensen, said ""the conventions that Denmark and many other countries signed many years ago, we signed based on a global situation that was not the global situation of today.""
Violating conventions
In a January 15 letter to Støjberg, the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils Muiznieks, said the issue of family reunifications raises ""issues of compatibility with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protects the right to respect for one's family life.""
The bill ""could also infringe on the rights of children to live within their family environment, as prescribed by the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child,"" he added.
""Those are his personal views,"" Venstre's Jensen retorted.
""The Council of Europe, as an organisation, has not started any type of case against Denmark,"" he told AFP.
Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants after Finland, Austria, Germany and Sweden.
As elsewhere in Europe, tensions have begun to emerge between locals and migrants as the continent struggles to cope with its largest migration flow since 1945.
Young women have filed police reports against migrants for inappropriate behaviour, while one nightclub in Sønderborg bars entry to those who do not speak English, Danish or German and other establishments are now considering following its lead.
Critics believe the bill could hurt Denmark's international standing.
""There will be very significant diplomatic, political and legal criticism of Denmark,"" human rights lawyer Poul Hauch Fenger told AFP.
""Another consequence will be that Denmark loses respect abroad and within international organisations in terms of morals, ethics and values,"" he added.
Støjberg has acknowledged the reforms could fall foul of international conventions.
""We have gone to the limits of the conventions and it is true that there is a (risk) in relation to the issue of family reunifications. But it's a risk I'm willing to take,"" she told news agency Ritzau in December."

Danish toy giant Lego refused a bulk order from Ai in October, saying it would not sell directly to users with ""political"" intentions. The decision set off a firestorm of criticism and ultimately led Lego to change its policy.
Ai is currently on the Greek island of Lesbos and is flooding his social media accounts with images of arriving asylum seekers."

					15:32 CET+01:00				",Nina Larson/AFP,Danish migrant bill blasted at UN,"The UN's top human rights body took Denmark to task on Thursday over its treatment of asylum seekers, with diplomats voicing alarm over rising xenophobia and a plan to seize valuables from migrants.
In the UN Human Rights Council's first review of Denmark's rights record since 2011, a number of the 87 country representatives who took the floor decried the Scandinavian country's recent tightening of its migration policies as it struggles to deal with record numbers of asylum seekers.
US representative Keith Harper was among those who voiced alarm over a bill expected to pass through the Danish parliament allowing the confiscation of migrants' valuables, among other measures.
""We note with concern the bill pending in the Danish parliament that would permit the Danish authorities to search the belongings of asylum seekers and seize cash and certain objects of value,"" he told the council.
Egyptian representative Mohamed Elmolla also blasted the bill, stressing that ""confiscating valuable belongings to cover refugees' expenses (is) in clear violation of their rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""
Gross misunderstandings
But Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen insisted the international outcry over the bill was due to ""gross misunderstandings.""
""The Danish welfare state is based upon the very simple principle that the state will provide and pay for those unable to take care of themselves, not for those who are able,"" he told the council.
""This simple principle applies for Danes seeking unemployment benefits, as well as to asylum seekers,"" he said, explaining the reasoning behind the plan to seize asylum seekers' cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than 10,000 kroner to help pay for their housing and benefits during the asylum process.
Wedding rings and other items of sentimental value are exempt, he stressed.
In Copenhagen on Thursday, the Danish lawmakers gave a final nod to the bill, guaranteeing that Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's minority right-wing government will win a January 26 parliamentary vote.
In Geneva, diplomats also raised concerns about other aspects of the bill, including measures making it harder for some asylum seekers to obtain family reunifications and residency permits.
And many decried a perceived increase in xenophobic and racist discourse in Denmark.
Veronika Bard, representing neighbouring Sweden voiced understanding over the challenges Denmark was facing, but said her country was ""concerned about the tendency of public discourse in Denmark to be prejudiced towards migrants, sometimes even amounting to hate speech.""
Jensen insisted that Denmark was a champion of human rights both at home and abroad, but acknowledged that with the large influx of refugees, his country needed ""to do better"" in the area of integration.
""Imbalances need to be addressed. They break down societal cohesion, foster the feeling of being excluded and create the fertile ground for radicalisation, hate crimes and discrimination,"" Jensen said.
""This vicious circle needs to be broken, and it will be a priority for my government to do so.""
Jensen is also expected to soon travel to Brussels to explain the bill to the European Parliament, which on Wednesday called on Denmark to address the body over its concerns about the legislation.
Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants after Finland, Austria, Germany and Sweden."

					13:31 CET+01:00				", The Local,'Exploited' migrants behind Danish tomatoes,"Danish supermarkets are filled with produce that is picked in Italy by “grossly exploited” illegal migrants working under harsh conditions, a new investigative report revealed.
According to a newly-released report from watchdog organisation DanWatch, two out of every three imported cans of tomatoes sold in Denmark come from Italy, where illegal migrants work long hours with no contract and very low pay. Some 400,000 migrant workers – primarily young men who come to southern Europe from north and west African countries – pluck tomatoes in Italy without a contract. They receive an average hourly wage of just €3 (22 kroner, $3.70) compared to an average wage of €8.20 for legally-employed workers and many of them are recruited by gang leaders and live in constant fear of their employers. “They are very scared and won’t talk about it with anyone. They live in sheds and barracks and shantytowns that exist solely of immigrants,” Louise Voller, the co-author of DanWatch's 'The backside of the tomato can: Gross exploitation and illegal manpower in Danish canned tomatoes', told broadcaster DR. Migrant workers told DanWatch that they can only find work through gang leaders known as ‘Caporali’, who they must pay in exchange for being delivered to Italian farmers. Canned tomatoes from Italy bring in 130 million kroner a year in Denmark, but the sales may violate UN laws. “The UN has defined guidelines for human rights and for trade so when these kinds of conditions are discovered, the supermarkets have a responsibility [...] when they find that the working conditions in Italy negatively impact migrant workers’ rights in relation to rest, free time and salary,” Sune Skadegaard Thorsen, the head of consulting firm Global CSR, told DR. After the release of DanWatch’s report, two major supermarket companies – Coop and Dansk Supermarked, who between them operate nearly all of the major supermarkets in Denmark – said they would bring up the workers’ conditions with their Italian suppliers. “We will take it up with our suppliers and will stress the importance of all tomatoes coming from responsible producers,” Mads Hvitved Grand, a spokesman for Dansk Supermarked, told DR. Dansk Supermarked operates the supermarket chains Netto, Bilka and Føtex. Its main competitor Coop, which operates the Kvickly, Super Brugsen, Irma and Fakta chains, also said it would push its Italian partners. “It’s a long, long haul for us. But that doesn’t mean that we won’t try. Quite the contrary,” company spokeswoman Ulla Riber told DR. Thorsen said the Danish companies need to get tough with the Italians. “At the end of the day, the chains need to say: ‘If we cannot sell tomatoes that are produced under acceptable conditions, then we will pull out.’ They have a responsibility to deliver a product that was made under proper conditions,” he said."

""The challenge for the Nordic region is not an internal one, but the fact that Schengen's outer borders have broken down,"" Solberg said.
""We must now make sure that the outer borders work,"" she added as Europe struggles to cope with its worst refugee crisis since World War II.
Schengen, which permits citizens of 26 states including non-EU member Norway to travel without passport formalities, is creaking under the strain of an unending flood of new arrivals with Germany, Austria and Slovakia reimposing border checks.
Solberg, whose Conservative Party is in a ruling coalition with the anti-immigration Progress Party, echoed concerns over Schengen expressed by French President Francois Hollande on Thursday.
Speaking to AFP, Hollande said Schengen was ""in danger"" due to the absence of registration centres to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants as EU states seek to share out some 120,000 asylum seekers, most fleeing the war in Syria.
Hollande said if there were no controls at the EU's external borders, states would feel obliged to restore national borders and controls ""and it will be the end of Schengen.""
Solberg was speaking after a joint meeting with colleagues from fellow Nordic states hosted by Denmark.
Norway controls an external EU frontier with Russia, a border which has been crossed by more than 250 Syrian refugees so far this year.
Sweden's Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said ""all those who have the right to asylum should be given it. Those who do not have the right should be sent back.""
And Danish counterpart Lars Løkke Rasmussen agreed, saying: ""Those who do not need protection should be sent back as quickly as possible.""
The crisis has sparked some disagreement between the Nordic states with Stockholm criticising Copenhagen for waving through some migrants to Sweden to make asylum claims.
Finland then criticised Sweden for doing the same in allowing a group of mainly Iraqi migrants to cross the border to make their own claims."

Denmark already had laws that could be used to require wealthy migrants to support themselves, they argued.

The bill looks set to pass in parliament on January 26 after the government on Tuesday secured a parliamentary majority. A series of debates will begin on Wednesday.

A European lawmaker for Venstre last month left the party over its ever tighter migration policies, which have included delaying family reunification times and advertising in Lebanese newspapers to deter refugees from coming to Denmark.
But observers believe the party's leadership is unlikely to be influenced by critics of Integration Minister Inger Støjberg's hardline policies.

Ferry operator Scandlines told public broadcaster DR that only passengers with a car would be let on board its ferries at the crossing.

The aid workers -- two Danes working for the NGO Team Humanity, and three Spanish citizens with the organisation PROEM-AID -- were detained on Thursday when coastguards patrolling off the island of Lesbos found two of them in possession of knives and an undeclared two-way radio.
The prosecutor in Lesbos' main town Mytilene on Thursday opened proceedings against the group on suspicion of ""attempting to facilitate the entry of illegal migrants"", and they were questioned over the weekend.
""The five detained people have been freed,"" an official with the island's port police told AFP, without saying who, if anyone, had been charged.
Greek authorities have in recent days begun a more stringent inspection of the aid groups operating on the holiday island -- which saw half a million migrants pass through last year on their way elsewhere in Europe -- in a bid to improve rescue coordination.
Seven volunteers -- including three Britons, two Americans, a Dane and a Cypriot -- had been arrested Saturday on suspicion of stealing lifejackets left behind by refugees.
They were later released after convincing the authorities that they intended to use the lifejackets for makeshift bedding for the migrants.
Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, criticised the spate of arrests, saying NGOs were filling a ""crucial gap in capacity"" as cash-strapped Athens struggled to cope with the flow of arrivals.
""The work of volunteers on the Greek islands is of critical importance, and saves lives,"" he wrote on Facebook.
""Those crucial activities should be facilitated by the Greek authorities, and not impeded.""
PROEM-AID said on its Facebook page that the three Spaniards had not been charged, but that Greek authorities were demanding a deposit of 15,000 euros ($16,400) from the NGO while they continue to investigate.
Greek islands in the Aegean Sea saw more than 800,000 migrants -- many of them refugees fleeing war-torn Syria -- land on their shores from Turkey in 2015, their first EU stop on a journey to new lives in Germany, Sweden and elsewhere.
More than 3,700 migrants died or were reported missing in the Mediterranean in 2015 while making the dangerous crossing, 800 of them while trying to make it to Greece and the rest heading towards Italy."

Legislation agreed in Denmark to seize the valuables of refugees in the hope of limiting the flow of migrants is ""despicable"", US-based rights watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday.
""I think it's despicable that Denmark and also in a sense Switzerland are moving to seize the last remaining assets of people, who by virtue of their movement and vulnerability tend to be impoverished and have very little on them,"" the executive director of HRW, Kenneth Roth, told a news conference in Istanbul, referring to a Swiss law that since the 1990s has required asylum seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them in the wealthy Alpine country.
""Does a rich country like Denmark really need to strip the very assets of these desperate asylum seekers before providing them basic services?"" asked Roth, who was presenting HRW's annual report in Istanbul.
He said the seizure plans appear ""purely vindicative and purely an effort to send a signal 'don't you dare come to Denmark if you're an asylum seeker who has arrived to European Union'"".
""That cold hearted response is not what we would expect from a wealthy European Union member,"" he added.
Roth's remarks were just one of many from the international community to condemn Denmark’s new bill aimed at dissuading migrants from seeking asylum by delaying family reunifications and allowing authorities to seize valuables to pay for the stay of migrants in asylum centres.
Some have likened the Danish proposals to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
British newspaper The Guardian published an editorial cartoon on Wednesday that depicted Danish PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen in a Nazi-like uniform while surrounded by the nation’s largest export successes: pork, Legos and a slogan that played off of Carlsberg’s ‘probably the best beer in the world’ tagline.

Thagesen said he didn’t think that the fallout over what has been labelled ‘Denmark’s jewellery law’ would reach the same levels as the Mohammed cartoon crisis a decade ago.
He cautioned however that debates that once might have remained within Denmark are now global fodder.

EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos called the meeting after Denmark this week slapped spot checks on its border with Germany, and Sweden imposed its own controls on travellers from Denmark.
""We agreed to keep (the measures) to a minimum and return to normal as soon as possible. This means the flows have to be slowed down,"" Avramopoulos said following the talks in Brussels with officials from Sweden, Denmark and Germany.
""We all agreed that Schengen and free movement must be safeguarded,"" Avramopoulos added.
More than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015 -- many of them fleeing the war in Syria -- in the worst crisis of its kind to face the continent since World War Two.
The EU's cherished passport-free Schengen area has come under huge strain, as many countries have reintroduced border controls to deal with the flow of migrants trying to reach wealthy Germany, Sweden and other countries from the main landing point in Greece.
Schengen rules mean checks can be reintroduced for up to six months.
But Swedish migration minister Morgan Johansson said on Wednesday that the new controls ""should not be put in place longer than we need"".
He said the checks were necessary because his country has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation -- 160,000 asylum requests last year, including 26,000 unaccompanied minors, with 115,000 of them in the last four months.
Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg said they were ""monitoring the situation by the hour"" but added that ""in Denmark we don't wish to be the final destination for thousands and thousands of asylum seekers.""
Støjberg told reporters after the meeting, however, that she informed Avramopoulos that Denmark could implement further measures at its border “if necessary” and with short warning.

					09:41 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Here’s how Denmark’s famed ‘jewellery law’ works,"Beginning Friday, Danish police now have the authority to take cash and valuables from refugees – here’s how it will work in practice.
The Immigration Ministry has sent guidelines to Danish police on how to carry out the search and seizure of cash and valuables from arriving asylum seekers as Denmark’s newly-passed controversial legislation officially takes effect on Friday.
Under the guidelines, police are told not to take wedding rings or engagement rings and individual officers are left to determine the “sentimental value” of other items.
Police are told not to take items if they are ""associated with a particular personal story that means the object cannot be replaced by another one,"" the guidelines read.
Before any search takes place, officers are told to first ask migrants to show any cash or valuables they have on their person or in their baggage.
“With the visitation, police must in part determine if the foreigner is wearing any visible valuables and must also examine the clothing the foreigner is wearing without carrying out a search of their body. With the visitation, there shall be no undressing or entry into the human body,” the guidelines read.
Police are allowed to pat down the migrants’ clothing and check their pockets, as well as undo the top button of garments and roll up their sleeves to search for any hidden valuables.
Police will also have the authority to search the migrants’ bags.
“This entails that police can look through and investigate bags, suitcases, etc and that bags and suitcases can be emptied in order to check their contents,” the guidelines say.
The head of Denmark's police union, Claus Oxfeldt, said he didn't think the result of the searches would be ""extensive"".
""We are to pat people down like when we make arrests (and) ensure that people do not carry weapons,"" he told news agency Ritzau.
""I cannot imagine that there will be a lot of jewellery that we will confiscate,"" he added.
The controversial provision allowing authorities to seize valuables has been dubbed the ‘jewellery law’ in both the Danish and international media, although that element was just one part of a wide-ranging immigration bill. Other provisions include shortening the length of residence permits, making some refugees wait three years to apply for family reunifications and tougher rules for all foreigners to obtain permanent residency.
After thorny negotiations with the other parties, Copenhagen's minority right-wing government agreed to exempt wedding rings and other items of sentimental value from the searches.
It also raised the limit for how much cash a migrant can keep, as well as the value of any individual item they can keep, to 10,000 kroner (€1,340, $1,450) from the initial 3,000 kroner proposed.
Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants after Finland, Austria, Germany and Sweden.

""The accusation has not been proven,"" the judge said after the trial in the Lesbos capital Mytilene.
The firefighters from Spain and volunteers from Denmark, who faced up to 10 years in prison according to Amnesty International, enjoyed massive support from aid groups, with many sympathisers on hand for the verdict.
""A great victory for humanitarian aid,"" Spanish group Proem-AID tweeted after the ruling.

Two Greek coastguards had testified that the defendants, who were arrested in January 2016, had not informed the authorities of their rescue mission, and that they were not properly equipped for it.
According to one of the Spanish firefighters, Manuel Blanco, the Greek coastguard arrested them in the middle of the night after they returned from a rescue mission, which had been called off as the boat being sought could not be located.
The firefighters, from the southern Spanish city of Seville, had taken part in multiple refugee and migrant rescue missions in the Aegean.
Andalusian regional justice minister Rosa Aguilar was among the Spanish delegation along with representatives of the city of Seville.
The Spaniards worked as volunteers for Proem-AID and the Danes for Team Humanity as they sought to aid thousands of migrants, mostly Syrians, risking their lives to reach Europe via Lesbos and other Greek islands.
Some 5,100 migrants died in 2016 crossing the Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration.
More than 1,000 migrants, including many children, drowned in 2015 and 2016 in the narrow stretch of sea separating the Turkish coast from the Aegean islands.
""Humanitarian assistance cannot and should not be criminalised,"" one of the Danish defendants, Salam Aldin, told AFP.
Many fishermen from the small port of Sykaminia, one of the main landing sites for refugee boats at the time, were at the court to support Aldin.
The defendants ""were only helping to save lives"" while the Greek coastguard was overwhelmed, said a lawyer for the Spanish firefighters, Haris Petsikos.
The Spanish defendants met in early April with Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis, who was among the first to welcome the news of their acquittal.
""I am very pleased,"" he said in a tweet, hailing their ""superb humanitarian work in the Mediterranean.""
In Madrid, Amnesty issued a statement Monday backing the Spanish defendants, saying they had sought to ""prevent children, women and men from dying through drowning"".
Amnesty said the trial was ""absurd"" and showed ""moral confusion by those who try to criminalise actions of solidarity and to intimidate the defenders of human rights.""

Temporary controls were implemented on the border in January 2016 and have remained in place since.
Although extensions to the measure have been granted several times, the border control had been scheduled to expire in November this year.
But the government has now confirmed a further extension that will take the controls well into a third year.
The government cited “the migrant situation and serious terror threat against Denmark” as grounds for the new extension, reports broadcaster DR.
Immigration minister Inger Støjberg wrote in a press statement that, despite the drop in numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Europe in comparison with a peak in late 2015, the borders of Europe’s countries were still under pressure.
“We cannot close our eyes to the serious terror threat against Denmark. The government therefore finds it necessary to maintain border control for now,” she said according to DR.
Border controls at the land border with Germany currently work on a spot-check basis, with motorists stopped at random to show passports.
Police alone were responsible for carrying out the border checks until July this year, when the Home Guard (Hjemmeværnet) was brought in to assist.
Germany’s interior minister Thomas de Maizière announced on Thursday that Berlin would also be extending border controls for a further six months, meaning checks will stay in place in the Alpine Germany-Austria border region.
De Maizière said that a series of terror attacks in Germany and Europe were the cause of the extension.
The EU had wanted the border controls to be abolished by the end of the year, but five of the bloc’s countries, including Denmark, have sought to change the rules to allow for border controls to stay in place for up to four years.

Berth, who is his party’s EU spokesman, squared off with the Danish European Movement chairwoman Stine Bosse in a debate on Europe’s external borders for Europa Magasinet.
In one exchange, Berth said that migrants who try to reach Europe by boat should be shot.
“The only way you can do it effectively is simply to turn the boats away and say ‘You can’t sail into this territorial border, if you do you will either be shot or you will be turned around and sailed back’,” he said.
The debate’s host, Ole Stephensen, gave Berth the opportunity to clarify himself by asking if he really believed boats of migrants should be fired upon. Berth said it was “an example” of what could be done to protect the EU’s borders.
“We need to do what is necessary to ensure that the border is not violated,” he added.
His debate opponent Bosse seemed to hardly be able to believe what she had just heard.
“You cannot stand here and say that they be shot in the Mediterranean. I simply refuse to believe it,” she said.
As the clip of his comments began to circulate, Berth took to Facebook in an attempt to “address a coming press storm”.
“I of course don’t mean that a ship under the command of Nato or Frontex should shoot at migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean. What I mean is that warning shots should be fired at a vessel that is crossing into European territorial waters!” he said.
A lawmaker for the ruling Venstre party, Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, said on Twitter that the remarks were ""not okay"" and that ""warning shots are... a warning of what is to follow.""
""Of course you don't shoot at people who are fleeing. It shouldn't be necessary to say,"" Mette Frederiksen, the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, wrote on Facebook.
Berth’s debate remarks can be seen here.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, 2016 has been the deadliest year ever for refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean, with at least 4,700 people having died or gone missing during their journeys.

The Buddy Holly nightclub in the southern town of Sønderborg has hit the news after requiring customers to speak either Danish, English or German after women in several Danish towns hosting refugees complained of being harassed by asylum seekers.
While the club first introduced its language rule in 1997 -- long before Europe's worst migrant crisis since World War II -- tensions over the migrant crisis have brought the issue back to the fore.
Club owner Tom Holden, says he never intended to play into the hands of xenophobes, citing practical reasons instead for the policy.
""The product we are offering -- 'a happy evening in a safe environment' -- requires our staff to be able to talk to the patrons,"" Holden told AFP.
Not being able to communicate with ""large groups of customers"" created feelings of ""insecurity,"" he added.
Amnesty International in Denmark branded the measure discriminatory.
""Of course you can communicate with people if something security-related happens, even if they cannot speak Danish,"" spokesman Claus Juul told broadcaster TV 2.
Holden says the original idea behind the policy was to stop groups of people who arrive in the town's harbour from eastern Europe and Russia from entering the bar.
'Pure racism'
Buddy Holly regulars voiced outrage at the language requirement.
""To us it looked like pure racism,"" 19-year-old customer Søren Verdoner told regional daily Jydske Vestkysten, referring to two Syrians who were turned away despite having valid IDs.
""We often find that there are small groups of Syrians on the street outside, freezing.""
The migrant crisis, which last year saw over a million people reach Europe's shores, has sharply polarised public opinion in Denmark and many other EU states.
While many people take a liberal stance on resettling refugees, others favour imposing greater restrictions.
Distrust of migrants has grown especially after it emerged that hundreds of women were groped and = robbed in a throng of mostly Arab and North African men during New Year's festivities in Cologne, Germany.
A Danish bar and nightclub industry group recently reported a rise in the number of complaints from its 1,500 members over the behaviour of non-Danish customers.
""If you have a group of customers who come in and display a threatening behaviour, there are some security-related challenges if you can't enter into a dialogue,"" Torben Hoffmann Rosenstock, the head of Denmark's Restaurants and Cafes, told TV 2.

City councilwoman Maria Sloth of the leftist Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten), and her roommate, parliamentary hopeful Anne Hegelund, opened their door to the two men in September 2015, as Denmark experienced a wave of migrants.
The two women gave the migrants a place to sleep for the night and then bought them tickets to take a ferry to Norway the following day.

Sloth and Hegelund have previously defended their actions by saying they had merely “followed [their] conscience”.
Prior to her trial, Sloth told news agency Ritzau that she did not regret assisting the two men.

Nordic tour operators including Ving and Spies have emailed thousands of customers scheduled to take charter flights operated by Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia from Stockholm's Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport since June.
The tourists have been offered the chance to pack a box or unwanted bag weighing up to 20 kilos, containing clothes, blankets or toys they no longer need. The idea is that their donations will then be passed on to some of the thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean sea and arriving on the Greek islands of Kos and Lesvos, which are also hotspots for holidaymakers.
But on Thursday a spokesperson for Ving told The Local that only ""less than 10 people"" from Sweden had taken the opportunity to make a donation over the past six weeks, despite the firm sending out 1500 messages to Swedish passengers.
Earlier in the week Danish newspaper BT suggested that around 20 passengers flying out of Copenhagen had put extra bags on to Thomas Cook flights and Ving said that ""about 20"" other people had booked to take extra luggage to Lesbos on a flight leaving the Danish capital on Sunday.
""We would really like to help,"" Magdalena Öhrn, Ving's press spokesperson said.
""We are just offering an opportunity to people and I am happy that 20 people have done it. Even a small help is a help,"" she added.
But Öhrn told The Local she hoped that ""many more people"" would get involved in the coming months, with the initiative scheduled to run until at least September.
""We have the aeroplanes and other people have things they do not need any more, so it is a good thing,"" she said.
Öhrn added that all donated bags would be thoroughly checked as usual to ensure there is no security risk to other passengers and said that customers' bags would be prioritized in the event of too much extra luggage filling the plane.
""If there are any problems the extra bags will just go on the next flight,"" she explained.
Kos and Lesvos have been inundated with refugees from Syria and Afghanistan in recent months, with thousands of people making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean in order to reach the European Union.
The move represents a major shift in migration patterns with almost as many migrants now choosing Greece instead of Italy as their entry point to the EU, despite Greece's acute economic problems.
UN figures released in June suggested that more than 39,000 refugees arrived in Greece by sea during the first six months of 2015, compared with 45,000 who reached Italy."

“We had space in the house and we didn't discuss whether it was legal or not. We just followed our conscience,” they previously told Aarhus Stiftstidende.

Current EU rules for asylum seekers, known as the Dublin System, state that refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they reach. This means that Denmark, which has legal exemption from Dublin but participates through a so-called ‘parallel agreement’, is able to send refugees back to other EU member countries that they have previously been to.
On Wednesday, the EU commission released details of a proposed reform to the Dublin System to cater for the hundreds of thousands of refugees currently arriving in the EU from crisis-torn countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
“I have not spoken to the commission today. But the commission is fully aware of Denmark’s position in this case,” integration minister Inger Støjberg told Politiken.
The new proposal by the commission enables asylum seekers to be proportionally redistributed among other EU countries should an individual country come under significant strain.
Countries that refuse to accept the proportions required by the EU could face fines of up to 1.8 million kroner ($275,000) per refused asylum seeker.
Støjberg wants to secure a new parallel deal that would enable Denmark to continue sending migrants back to other EU countries without being subject to the EU distribution model.
Denmark risks becoming a “magnet” for asylum seekers if it ends up without an agreement and decided to leave the Dublin agreement, according to Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen.
Rasmussen said that without Dublin, migrants would be likely to ‘try their luck’ in Denmark in the knowledge that they cannot easily be deported to the EU country they arrived in, according to a Politiken report.
The right-wing Danish People’s Party (DF) advocates leaving the Dublin agreement altogether and introducing stricter border control that will turn refugees away before they enter Danish territory.
But Støjberg told Politiken that such measures are not possible due to Denmark’s participation in a number of international conventions.
“If an asylum seeker comes here and asks for asylum in Denmark, then we have to process his case. We can’t just introduce what the Danish People’s Party are asking for. At least, not if we want to abide by the conventions,” said Støjberg.
“You can not just leave conventions. That is a very wide-ranging process, and many things must be taken into consideration before leaving a convention,” the minister continued.
Støjberg told Politiken that she felt a “certain goodwill” from the EU commission towards the Danish position, and that although there was a long way to go, the government would “fight for its position”.
The minister also denied that Denmark was looking to shirk its responsibility towards other EU countries.
“If you look at the total number of asylum seekers in Denmark last year, we absolutely took responsibility. It’s no secret that I wish to reduce the number of asylum seekers in Denmark,” Støjberg told Politiken.
The proposed reforms also include measures to require asylum seekers to remain in the member states processing their cases and stronger guarantees for unaccompanied minors.
While Germany are expected to support the commission’s proposal, a number of other countries are also said to remain sceptical about redistribution of asylum seekers."

The migrants’ return to Hungary had been set on hold after reports that asylum seekers in Hungary were living under inhumane conditions. DIS and the Danish Foreign Ministry investigated the conditions in Hungary. DIS told Politiken that the Danish authorities’ investigation has concluded but declined to say what was discovered.
However, the agency said that the decision to reverse course on the 350 asylum seekers did not have anything to do with its investigation into the conditions they would have faced in Hungary. Instead, DIS said the deadline for returning the asylum seekers has now expired.

In a letter to its freight customers, HH Ferries said several migrants had been found hanging from the undersides of trucks in Helsingør in recent days in an apparent attempt to avoid ID checks.
The ferry operator’s CEO Henrik Rørbæk urged drivers to look out for any attempts to board ferries illegally.
“This is of course an unfortunate and potentially very dangerous situation that these people put themselves and others in,” he wrote in the letter, Danish news agency Ritzau reported.
The number of people trying to make their way from Denmark to Sweden by sea has risen in recent weeks, according to the Danish Shipowners’ Association.
“We’re seeing the same trend that we’ve seen in the English Channel,” the association’s director Jakob Ullegård told Ritzau.
“When vehicles stop on the road down to the ferry they sneak up under the trucks.”
Swedish police said earlier this week that they had received reports of people who had successfully entered the country on trucks.
Details were scarce but police said members of the pubic had seen migrants under a truck on the E6 motorway in Helsingborg, while others were seen leaving a truck at a nearby rest stop.
Sweden took in a record 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015 before introducing ID checks to stem the flow.
The influx put the country’s finances and housing under strain and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven faced a hearing at the parliamentary constitutional committee on Friday morning to answer questions about Sweden’s handling of the crisis.
Löfven argued that not even the migration agency had foreseen the dramatic rise in refugee arrivals that saw an average of 10,000 asylum seekers each week make their way to Sweden in the autumn.
Sweden put its agencies on crisis alert from August and the government took around 70 decisions designed to control the situation, Löfven said.
“Thanks to the work of the crisis organization, intensified information-gathering and flexible working structures the government was able in the autumn to take the necessary decisions to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in Sweden and relieve the acute pressure on the reception process,” he said.
The Prime Minister was summoned to the constitutional committee by politicians including Jessica Polfjärd from the centre-right Moderates who felt the government had handled the refugee crisis badly and let it get out of hand.
""Since the government has ultimate responsibility for crisis management we think there are issues that need to be fully looked into so the Swedish people can be told why there were delays,"" Polfjärd told newspaper Dagens Nyheter when she reported the government to the constitutional committee in January."

It was Britain’s poorer and less-educated citizens — angry at not having shared in the economic benefits of a new world order — who pushed it out of the European Union, in a vote that threatens elites, analysts say.
They are those who suffered the worst hangover from the economic crisis, and whose precarious economic position makes them most fearful of rising immigration — to the benefit of far right groups in the E.U. and Donald Trump in the United States.
“I see the same pattern everywhere I look,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Brookings Institution.
“The demographic splits within the U.K. are exactly the same category for category as the demographic splits within the American electorate in this presidential election.”
Rural areas with high numbers of migrant workers, former industrial hubs and poor areas around cities, those without a university education and older voters were all among the 53.4 percent who voted Brexit.
Mr. Galston said this was the same demographic backing controversial Republican candidate Mr. Trump in the U.S., as well as eurosceptic and far-right parties enjoying a rise in support across Europe.
“They mistrust political elites because up until now they haven’t seen any political parties who appear to recognise their discontent and respond to it.”
Mr. Galston said while he did not expect these forces to prevail in the United States as they did in the Brexit vote, they were a “major warning signal to established parties throughout Europe”.
Fears are high of a domino effect, with eurosceptic, leftist and far right parties from France to the Netherlands crying victory after the shock Brexit result was announced and calling for similar votes in their own countries.
Political scientist Melanie Sully of the Vienna-based Go-Governance Institute warned Europe was facing a “crisis of democracy” that could be exploited by xenophobic, far right parties.
“If you don’t have any trust in politics, it’s exactly the sort of black hole populists can march into and capture the mood and build on it, to perpetuate their own falsehoods,” she told AFP.
At the root of this surge in anti-establishment sentiment is a feeling of fear, loss of control, and traditions and identity lost among those who are struggling economically, analysts say.
“Before we talk about populism, the anti-establishment, we have to talk about the social position of these people. What do they earn? How do they see their everyday lives?” said Tetiana Havlin, a sociologist at the University of Siegen in Germany.
“In everyday life nobody thinks about anti-globalisation, anti-establishment. They just see their challenges”, she said.
“This of course gives fertile ground for populism... but in the end this is about what people feel.”
Observers point to two main drivers of the surge in scorn for the elite: the hangover from the 2008/2009 economic crisis and the refugee crisis.
“You have a lot of people who took a big hit. These are people who feel economically vulnerable, and when you put demographic fears on top of economic vulnerability this is what you get,” said Mr. Galston.
“I don’t think it’s mysterious anymore, we may have been scratching our head a year ago but we should be in no doubt now.”
Many young people who voted ‘Remain’ are furious at the number of older British voters who backed ‘Leave’ — lumbering them, as they see it, with the consequences of their decision for decades to come.
Ms. Havlin said that many of these voters saw the E.U. as a source of security and stability when Britain joined in 1973, a time she refers to as “the prosperity years”.
Now older, these voters reeling from austerity and a sense of growing threats at Europe’s borders, feel “threatened and insecure”.
Dominique Moisi, of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) said the Brexit earthquake was a dark moment in Europe’s history, comparing it unfavourably to the fall of communism.
“Remember Star Wars: there is the light side and the dark side of the force. The light side was the fall of the Berlin Wall. The dark side is Brexit.”"

The study, published in the journal Antiquity, contradicts the ‘People of the British Isles’ project, which used DNA evidence to argue that there was “no clear genetic evidence of the Danish Viking occupation“.
Jane Kershaw, a postdoctoral fellow at University College London, used her knowledge of the archeological evidence for Danish settlement, and combined it with the DNA expertise of Dr Ellen Røyrvik from Warwick University, who worked on the Peoples of the British Isles project.
“We consider the details of certain assumptions that were made in the study, and offer an alternative interpretation to the above conclusion,” the two wrote in their abstract. “We also comment on the substantial archaeological and linguistic evidence for a large-scale Danish Viking presence in England.”
Kershaw told the Danish magazine Videnskab that she viewed the Danish Vikings as economic migrants little different from those arriving in the UK and Denmark today.
""At that time, there may not have been enough resources in the Vikings' homeland, but in eastern England the Vikings found an agriculturally rich area,"" she said.
""We are currently living in a time of large-scale migration,” she added. “We must open our eyes to the fact that the same thing happened 1,000 years ago, rather than think of our ancestors as people who just stayed at home and never left their farms.”
According to Professor Søren Sindbæk, a researcher at the University of Aarhus, the Danish Viking migrants caused so much resentment amongst the Anglo-Saxons that in 1002, King Æthelred the Unready gave orders for them all to be killed in what became known as the St. Brice's Day massacre.
“They were certainly getting tired of immigration in England around the 1000s,” Sindbæk told the magazine. “We do not know how many ended up being killed, but there is no doubt that a mass murder took place.”
Sindbæk said that the massacre suggested that immigration was an issue among Britain's residents even then.
“The episode underlines the fact that the Vikings were such a large population, that Danes was seen as a political force and in some contexts a problem.""
Æthelred certainly justified the massacre in a Royal Charter in terms reminiscent of today’s most incendiary anti-immigration language.
The Danes had “sprung up in this island, sprouting like darnel ryegrass [a weed] amongst wheat”, he complained.
Therefore, he argued, they had to be “destroyed by a most just extermination.”"

Under the first draft of the bill, due go before parliament on January 13th, migrants would have been entitled to keep only cash and valuables worth around 3,000 kroner (400 euros, $435).
But in the face of criticism -- and comparisons to Nazi Germany's seizing of gold and valuables from Jews and others during World War 2 -- Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said the total sum would be increased to 10,000 kroner ($1,450, 1,340 euros).

In addition, items for personal use such as mobile phones and watches as well as items of sentimental value such as wedding rings will be exempted, the ministry said in a statement.
The centre-right minority government has defended the bill, arguing that Danish nationals seeking welfare handouts can expect similar treatment.
""It is already the case that if you as a Dane have valuables for more than 10,000 kroner it may be required that this is sold before you can receive unemployment benefits,"" Støjberg said last month.

The proposed law is the latest in a string of moves by Copenhagen to avoid the kind of refugee influx seen in neighbouring Sweden, where around 150,000 people had applied for asylum by the end of November 2015 compared to just 18,000 in Denmark.
Other measures have included shortening residence permits, delaying family reunifications and placing adverts in Lebanese newspapers to deter migrants.
""In Denmark, if one can manage on one's own, one manages on one's own. It's a principle which must apply as much to asylum seekers as it applies to Danes,"" Støjberg said on Friday, quoted by the Ritzau news agency."

					09:39 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,Sweden-bound migrants pulled out of Danish waters,"UPDATED: Four male asylum seekers were pulled out of the Øresund on Monday afternoon in a large-scale rescue operation involving boats, helicopters and divers.
Two of the migrants were in hospital after authorities pulled them from icy waters off Denmark on as they tried to reach Sweden to ask for asylum, Danish police said.
The rescued migrants were part of a group of four who attempted crossing the strait between Denmark and Sweden, where the water is around 8C.
""There were two who were taken to hospital after the rescue operation,"" police spokesman Henrik Svejstrup told local Danish broadcaster TV 2 Lorry.
""One was put on a respirator, but we expect him to be taken out of the coma"" later on Tuesday, he added.
The rescue operation was carried out off the coast of the sparsely populated island of Saltholm, around four kilometres off the Danish coast and near the Øresund Bridge.
An island resident told TV2 that two of the men knocked on the door of a local house on Saltholm under the false impression that they had reached Sweden. The men spoke poor English but said they wanted to seek asylum.
They asked the resident for a glass of water and then left the home. The sea rescue operation got underway shortly thereafter.
A Copenhagen Police spokesman told TV2 that the four men were rescued between Saltholm and the artificial island of Peberholm.
“Four people were swimming around in the water. Three of them came onto land at Saltholm on their own and the fourth person was raised out of the water by a helicopter,” vice inspector Henrik Møller Jakobsen said.
Jakobsen said that an investigation was underway, but did not release any information about the nationality of the four men. Police did say, however, that the men had most recently been living at Center Sandholm, the largest asylum centre in Denmark.
“We are trying to figure out what happened. The first order of business is to determine if their papers are legitimate and how they got out there. Did they sail, were they brought out to Peberholm or did they get their some other way?,” Jakobsen said to Ritzau.
Copenhagen Police said last month that dozens of people have tried to walk over the high-speed Øresund Bridge that connects Copenhagen to Malmö in an effort to avoid Sweden’s ID controls, which were implemented in January after the country took in 160,000 asylum seekers in 2015.
The crossing, made famous in the Nordic Noir detective series The Bridge (Broen), allows drivers to travel at up to 90 kilometres an hour and includes a motorway tunnel as well as an open air road section.
Copenhagen Police have installed new warning signs designed to deter walkers as well as heat sensors to better allow them to trace people making the potentially deadly journey.
Ferry operators have also warned that growing numbers of asylum seekers are trying to get to Sweden from Denmark by clinging to the undersides of trucks boarding the ferry in Helsingør in an apparent attempt to avoid the ID checks."

Judges at the European Court of Justice were asked to decide whether Germany could refuse unemployment benefits to so-called 'poverty migrants' under certain conditions. Denmark supported the German authorities in the case, which was prompted after a Romanian woman living in Leipzig applied for unemployment benefits and her local job centre refused when she didn't take up jobs they suggested to her. Both the job centre and a court in Leipzig agreed that 25-year-old Elisabeta Dano, who moved to Germany in 2010 to live with her sister, had never really been looking for work. But she appealed her case all the way to the European Court. Now the EU court has said that states must have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants, a position supported by Denmark. ""We have decided that Denmark should give a submission in the German case because it is of fundamental importance. It goes to the heart of the interpretation of free movement,"" the then-employment minister Mette Frederiksen told Politiken in March. The judges wrote that Dano did not have “sufficient means of support“ for herself and her 10-year-old son when she moved to Germany, and therefore couldn't justify her right to remain. That also meant that she couldn't bring a case against the authorities based on EU anti-discrimination rules.
By agreeing that countries should be allowed to deny immigrants benefits under certain circumstances, the court followed the advice of experts whose testimony it had heard during the case. They said that it should be legal to deny the applications of people who had travelled to a country with the sole purpose of claiming benefits. This has been the position of the Danish government as well. ""We [support the German case] with the rather simple premise that EU citizens should not travel across national borders to be supported by others. If we travel, we do it to seek a job, to work and to contribute to society,"" Frederiksen said. In addition to Denmark, other European Union members have been eagerly awaiting the result, as it will have significant consequences for the current debate on freedom of movement. British Prime Minister David Cameron hopes to limit the ability of migrants from other EU countries to claim benefits in the UK, as he is faced with a Eurosceptic, anti-immigration challenge from the right by the UK Independence Party. The court received submissions from Dano's lawyer as well as the German, Danish, Irish, French, Austrian and UK governments and the European Commission, the judges reported in their ruling."

Police were notified after heat sensors in the tunnel alerted authorities, who stopped all train traffic.
""They were all young men and were handed over to the Migration Agency. We have had previous attempts on the Danish side, but they have all been caught by Danish police. This was the first time someone made the whole journey,"" police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford told The Local.

The attempts follow Sweden's decision in January to demand photo identification from all travellers from Denmark as part of efforts to more closely monitor the flow of asylum seekers between the two countries.
News Öresund, which first broke the news about the most recent incident, reported on Friday that more than 55 attempts to make the journey on foot have been made since the start of the year.
But Westford did not rule out that the number could be higher, despite Swedish police being stationed at the border since last year, in a move separate to the photo identification checks at Copenhagen Airport.
""There are gaps in the net, because the border control is peripheral, it's not one hundred percent. There are probably hidden statistics,"" said Westford.

Eight people have on four separate occasions attempted to skirt ID controls on the Swedish-Danish border by hiding on or underneath trucks travelling by Øresund ferries from the Danish city of Helsingør to Helsingborg in Sweden, according to a report sent by the Danish justice ministry to the parliament's judicial committee.
The first incident reported to the Scandlines/HH Ferries company happened on April 12th, when two people tried to board the ferry by ""lying down on some trucks' wheel axles"", according to Danish police cited in the official document. The pair ran off after they were discovered by drivers but were never caught by police.
Two days later, another two people were caught hiding under the wheel arches of a truck on board the ferry. They were handed over to Danish police and returned to Helsingør.
On April 17th a person ran off after being discovered by security staff while trying to hide underneath a truck. A day later a transport worker reported seeing three people trying to hide in a vehicle at the port in Helsingør.
The same month a Swedish police spokesperson told media that they had received reports of people successfully entering the country on trucks. Details were scarce at the time but police said members of the public had seen migrants under a truck on the E6 motorway in Helsingborg, while others were seen leaving a vehicle at a nearby rest stop.
According to the Danish justice ministry's report, which was written in mid-May but only grabbed headlines on Tuesday, no more attempts have been made since security was boosted and higher barbed wire fences put up at the ferry terminal in Helsingør. The extra security patrols have since been stepped down.
Last month Swedish police told The Local, after five asylum seekers for the first time successfully crossed the famous Øresund Bridge from Copenhagen to Malmö on foot, that the number of illicit border crossings may well be higher than previously known.
""There are gaps in the net, because the border control is peripheral, it's not one hundred percent. There are probably hidden statistics,"" said police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford at the time.
The number of people seeking asylum in Sweden has dropped dramatically since the new ID and border controls were introduced, with an average of less than 500 a week showing up in the Nordic country, compared to almost 10,000 during the autumn.
Similarly, Denmark has seen seven straight weeks in which fewer than 100 people have sought asylum, marking a significant drop from the 641 who came in the first week of Danish border controls.

Train traffic on the Øresund Bridge connecting the two Scandinavian countries was interrupted while Danish and Swedish police arrested the trio, Copenhagen Police said on Friday.
Their identities or nationalities were not immediately known.
According to Copenhagen Police spokesman Kristian Aaskov, there are now “near daily” incidents of asylum seekers trying to make it across the bridge on foot in an attempt to skirt ID checks introduced by Sweden earlier this year.
And the company that runs the Øresund Bridge said that the number of cases is on the rise.
“We have had around 55 incidents since January. They have increased in the past few weeks,” head of public relations Sanna Holmqvist told regional Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan.
Heat sensors have already been installed in the railway tunnel connecting the Danish side of Øresund to the bridge to catch pedestrians. In April, when a lone walker was spotted walking on the motorway, Holmqvist told The Local that police also had access to a network of some 400 cameras.
But she said on Friday that they are currently looking into ways of making the process even more difficult, expecting the number of illicit attempted crossings to go up during the summer.
“More lighting and higher fences are things we're talking about. The problem is that those who try to flee this way have other considerations in mind than that it is dangerous to walk next to a speeding train. But we're trying to do everything to increase security,” she told Sydsvenskan.
The latest incident comes a week after a group of five asylum seekers for the first time made it all the way across the combined road and rail bridge into Sweden on foot.
Swedish police told The Local at the time that the number may well be higher, despite the photo identification controls and Swedish police being stationed at the border since last year.

A court in the southeastern town of Nykøbing ordered Lisbeth Zornig, a high-profile figure in Denmark who has formerly served as the country's ombudsman for children's rights, and her journalist husband to each pay a fine of 22,500 kroner (€3,000, $3,350) for having aided migrants on the road to a new life.
Several hundred people have been charged with aiding migrants in Denmark in recent months. The sentences have generally been mild to date.
In the most recent conviction before Zornig's, a man who transported four Afghan migrants was ordered to pay a fine of 5,000 kroner (€670, $744).

Zornig had picked up the Syrian family in Rødbyhavn -- a port through which many migrants passed en route from Germany, before Copenhagen reinstated border controls in early January -- and drove them to Copenhagen.
""For me, it was like picking up hitch-hikers,"" Zornig told the court.
""Nobody thinks to ask them for their identification papers,"" she said, according to Danish news agency Ritzau.
Her husband, Mikael Rauno Lindholm, was accused of having served the same Syrian family coffee and biscuits in the couple's home, driving them to the train station, and buying their tickets to Sweden.
He explained to the court that he had called the police to ask if he was allowed to do so within the law.
""The police duty officer told me that was a good question but wasn't able to answer,"" he said.
According to police statistics, 279 people have been charged in Denmark for aiding migrants between September 2015 and February 2016, compared to 140 in 2014.
The rise reflects the surge in refugees who have arrived in the Scandinavian countries since last autumn.
Sweden received 163,000 asylum applications last year, with a peak of 10,000 a week as of September.
Denmark, which has half the population of Sweden, received 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, a rise of 44 percent from the previous year.
The two countries have tightened their asylum conditions in recent months, which has drastically reduced the flow of migrants arriving.
Most notably, Denmark has authorised police to confiscate migrants' valuables upon their arrival in the country.
""We are now known for confiscating jewelry and valuables from refugees, people who have lost everything. Are we now also going to be known for punishing citizens who help people in need?"" Zornig said in a statement.
""Is there no lower limit for what Denmark will do to make its mark in the international community?"""

Austria and Denmark plan to launch a pilot project establishing a deportation centre based outside the EU for rejected asylum seekers.
The two countries have been engaged in negotiations over the proposed centre since early this year.
Aims of the project include providing shelter to refugees closer to their home countries and to disrupt people smuggling operations.
Støjberg spoke about the envisaged system with Austrian interior minister Herbert Kickl on Thursday.
“We maintain that asylum should be sought in the first country you arrive in, instead of travelling through Europe,” the Danish minister said to Ritzau.
“In return, we are committed to increasing the capacity [of countries neighbouring conflict areas to manage asylum arrivals, ed.]. That can mean anything from healthcare, education, border guards and a system to manage asylum seekers,” she said.
A deportation centre located outside the EU would reduce incentive for people to travel across Europe to seek asylum, according to Støjberg.
“If you can see how quickly you can be sent back, there’s no reason to spend all your money and risk your life to get here,” she said.
The minister maintained that the proposal was within the European Union’s human rights conventions for refugees.
She called for support from other European countries for the project.
“It is important that the joint EU policy is that asylum seekers must stay in the first safe country they reach,” she said to Ritzau.
“I think we have a realistic proposal that also takes into consideration the needs of neighbouring countries,” she said.
Denmark and Austria would continue working for an agreement with other EU countries to enable the implementation of the deportation centre outside of the EU, she said.
According to broadcaster DR’s report from the Vienna press conference, the location and timescale for opening of the proposed centre is currently being kept under wraps.
Kickl said he was optimistic about the proposal’s prospects but would not give further detail, DR writes.

					11:40 CET+01:00				", The Local,Nordic welcome chillier as numbers snowball,"Asylum seekers flowing to Scandinavia are finding chillier welcomes as their numbers surge and far-right parties increasingly assert their influence on immigration policy, analysts say.
Denmark, Norway and Finland – but also Sweden, until now especially welcoming to migrants – have begun cutting back the benefits they offer to newcomers while also hardening their asylum policies.
""It seems there's a certain amount of competition aimed at not offering the most generous social benefits to asylum seekers,"" said Asle Toje, a Norwegian international relations expert.
Denmark's immigration policy has grown tighter since 2001, when the far-right Danish People's Party (DF) began influencing policy-making.
In July, soon after elections made DF the country's second-largest party, Denmark moved to slash benefits to asylum seekers in a bid to reduce the influx. Under the new rules, which came into effect in September, a recently arrived immigrant without children now receives 5,945 kroner (€797, $897) per month, compared with the 10,849 kroner they got previously.
The move seems to have had the desired effect, since the number of asylum seekers declined in September from a year earlier while setting records elsewhere in Europe.
Syrians, Afghans and Eritreans are still arriving en masse in Denmark, but they generally move on to destinations considered more hospitable.
""Many of them say that the conditions are better for them in other countries, perhaps Sweden, and so they go there,"" said DF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl.
DF, an indispensable ally of Denmark's minority Venstre government, is doing all it can to make the country less attractive to refugees.
'Generous welfare states'
Norway and Finland, both led by governments with anti-immigration elements, are similarly moving to cut back social services and toughen conditions for uniting families and granting citizenship or permanent residency.
""It's clear that the Nordic countries have generous welfare states, but we must ask ourselves if we should share them with those who come in,"" said Norway's justice secretary of state, Joran Kallmyr, of the right-wing populist Progress Party.
Norway, an island of prosperity thanks to its hydrocarbons, is becoming unsure of preserving its comfortable lifestyle as oil prices decrease.
Even ultra-liberal Sweden, despite taking in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU state – the country is expecting around 190,000 this year for a population of under 10 million – has decided to tone down its image of generosity.

In line with the rise of the far-right Sweden Democrats party, the kingdom is now demanding that its European partners share more of the burden, and it plans to harden conditions for reuniting families.
Sweden's ""Social Democrats are worried about losing voters to the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who were capitalizing on people's fears over mass migration to Sweden,"" said Magnus Hagevi, political scientist at Linnea University.
""Already we've witnessed a rash of arson attacks on migrant facilities across Sweden – people are also worried about the price of immigration. Many people are worried about what the future will bring and how that will affect the welfare state,"" he said.
Again on Saturday, a planned refugee shelter was burned down in Sweden, the latest in a string of suspected arson cases targeting a huge influx of migrants.
Using social media
The Nordic countries are also trying to use the media to help them stop the flow at its source.
In September, Denmark took out advertisements in the Lebanese press warning about new asylum regulations in the hope of discouraging Syrian refugees.
Norway and Finland have tried to get the message across on Facebook, where the bulk of migrants turn to compare possible destinations.

""Human traffickers spread rumours on social networks to sell trips by making people believe they should leave for Europe now because the borders are open,"" Kallmyr said. ""We should correct these rumours... and spell out what awaits them – less aid, difficulty reuniting families and lots of rejected requests.""
Toje had a more nuanced view.
""Refugees are not coming here mainly to take advantage of the welfare state,"" he said. ""They are fleeing countries where there is war, conflict and hardship. So even if we reduce services, I don't think that will necessarily lessen the number of asylum seekers."""

Støjberg previously stoked controversy last year when she posted to Facebook a photo of her smiling and holding a cake to celebrate Denmark's 50th measure for toughening immigration laws.
One of the strongest measures came into force in 2016, allowing police to seize valuables from refugees, although the government's guidelines exempted wedding and engagement rings after critics likened the plans to the confiscation of gold from Jews by the Nazis during World War II.
Over the last 15 years, the country has tightened its immigration policies, insisting that migrants must learn the country's customs and language in order to adapt to the labour market.

Watching over the EU’s southern borders in the Mediterranean is a very important assignment that the Danish Challenger plane will now contribute to,” Defence Minister Nicolai Wammen said in a press release after meeting with his counterparts in Brussels.

“I expect that today [the EU] will increase contributions to the Triton operation so we can save more lives, and Denmark will also contribute to that,” Thorning-Schmidt said on April 23.
Denmark’s opt-out on Justice and Home Affairs keeps it from being a part of the EU’s proposed refugee redistribution plan and its defence opt-out precludes participation in the EU’s plan to undertake a military operation aimed at human smugglers operating in the Mediterranean.

The Defence Ministry stated that the defence opt-out does not affect Denmark’s ability to contribute to Frontex, the EU agency that secures the union’s external borders and includes missions such as Triton.
The EU-run Triton operation has been used to partially replace an Italian navy search-and-rescue operation known as Mare Nostrum which was suspended at the end of last year.
Denmark has also vowed to contribute 22 people to Frontex operations.

Explaining that there are only “limited opportunities to detain foreigners who come to the country”, the Danish National Police (Rigspolitiet) announced that officers will no longer attempt to stop arriving refugees and migrants from leaving Denmark if they don’t wish to formally seek asylum.
“This is a police decision built on the options that are allowed under the law and on our obligations. We can not hold foreigners who don’t seek asylum and who can’t be sent out [of the country] quickly again,” National Police Chief Jens Henrik Højberg said in a statement.
Højberg said that that refugees and migrants who do want to seek asylum in Denmark will be processed and transferred to local immigration authorities.
However, the Danish Justice Ministry added that just 400 of the estimated 3,200 refugees and migrants who have arrived in Denmark since Sunday afternoon have applied for asylum. Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen put the number at 668 later on Thursday.
""The large majority of the arrivals [...] have refused to communicate with Danish authorities. Most of those who have had contact with the Danish police have stated that they want to go to Sweden to claim asylum,"" a ministry statement read.
After days of trying to register the arrivals and house them in temporary quarters, the Danish National Police explained that it can no longer try to keep the refugees in Denmark.
“We can obviously not detain so many people indefinitely. Therefore there are no other options than to let them go. And with that, we cannot keep them from going wherever they want,” Højberg said.
As of Thursday morning, trains arriving in both the harbour town of Rødby and the southern Jutland town of Padborg were being allowed to continue on toward Copenhagen, the jumping-off point for crossings by bus, train or car to Sweden.
Police have also reportedly allowed citizens to drive refugees to Sweden by car, a practice that earlier in the week led to a handful of arrests.
Officers said that most of the arriving refugees and migrants were actively avoiding any contact with the Danish police in an effort to not be registered in Denmark.
“We have a very difficult task handling all of those who enter – especially because most of them do not want to contact us and be registered. We are talking about people, families and children, who have been travelling a long time from conflict areas, and Danish police are doing a lot to deal with this situation peacefully, using dialogue and patience,” National Police Commissioner Svend Larsen said in a separate statement.
Sweden, one of many European countries struggling with the worst migration crisis since World War Two, has become a top EU destination for refugees by issuing permanent residency to all Syrian asylum seekers since 2013.
In contrast, Denmark has sought to reduce the influx by issuing temporary residence permits, delaying family reunions and slashing benefits for newly arrived immigrants. The Danish government has publicized those policies through an international advertising campaign.
Swedish officials said on Thursday that 322 refugees have crossed over from Denmark since Monday.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has called for a meeting with the leaders of parliament’s political parties later on Thursday to discuss the government’s position on the refugee influx.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven meanwhile has called for Sweden’s entire public sector to unite to ensure the swift resettlement of the latest influx of refugees."

					08:54 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Denmark's 'sad' position in EU asylum plan,"Denmark's EU opt-outs keep it from being a part of the plans to more evenly distribute refugees and to take the fight to smugglers in the Mediterranean.
The European Commission’s plan to implement a quota system for a more balanced acceptance of refugees across the EU is being hotly debated across the continent. Countries like Sweden and Germany that take in a disproportionate number of refugees have endorsed the proposal, while the UK and others have signalled their strong resistance.
Denmark, due to its opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs, would not be included in the plan but that doesn’t mean that it isn’t being heavily debated here.
In an interview with Politiken published on Friday, Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard said it was “very sad” that Denmark’s opt-out will keep it out of the EU’s shared solution to the migrant crisis.
“In Denmark we have had a debate about the EU that makes it so that we need to underline the fact that this entire area is something that we will absolutely not leave to the EU. But at the same time, it is plainly obvious that in this situation it would be in Denmark’s interest to do it,” Lidegaard said.
Per capita, Denmark took in the sixth highest number of asylum applications in 2014 and the European Commission’s plan would force countries that take in far fewer refugees than Denmark to heavily step up their contributions.

But with Denmark not included in the plan and the Danish political climate filled with EU-scepticism, asylum and immigration policies will continue to be set at a national level.
Danes have been promised a referendum on ending the nation’s EU Justice and Home Affairs opt-out and replacing it with an ‘opt-in’ model, but the five Eurocentric parties backing the plan have made it clear that they are for maintaining Denmark’s exemption on EU asylum and immigration policies.
Lidegaard said the looming referendum casts a long shadow over Denmark’s role in dealing with Europe’s mass influx of refugees. He, like many others, feels that if the referendum aimed to move asylum and immigration policies under the auspices of the EU, Danes would likely vote against ending the opt-out, which in turn would put the country on the outside looking in when it comes to law enforcement agency Europol and the European judicial cooperation agency Eurojust.
“I think that right now a prerequisite for winning a referendum on the opt-out is the decision we made [to keep asylum policies at the national level, ed.] and I stand by that. But at the same time I must say that I regret the decision,” Lidegaard said.
“It is clear that some things cannot be solved by member states. Denmark takes more refugees than the average and there are clearly countries in the EU that should take more refugees than they do today,” he added.
While Denmark’s opt-out to Justice and Home Affairs keeps it from the refugee distribution plan, its defence opt-out excludes it from the EU’s plan to undertake a military operation aimed at human smugglers operating in the Mediterranean.
There too Lidegaard said that Denmark would benefit from being involved.
“We are not going to be sitting at the table when they discuss what to do with these smugglers and what should be done if one is to undergo peacekeeping initiatives. Thus we have given up our vote on our own security,” the foreign minister told Politiken.
Lidegaard said it was “clear” that Denmark should turn its attention to ending its defence opt-out after the referendum on Justice and Home Affairs.
Denmark was granted four opt-outs from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty: defence; justice and home affairs; the maintaining of the kroner rather than the euro; and an opt-out on citizenship rules that was cancelled out by the Amsterdam Treaty that took effect in 1999.
Denmark last held a referendum on its relationship to the EU in 2000, when voters once again rejected the euro."

All train, bus and ferry passengers travelling from Denmark to Sweden will from Monday be required to show photo identification before being allowed across the border in a drastic move by the Swedish government to stem an unprecedented migrant influx.
Travellers have been warned to expect long queues and delays once the checks go into effect from midnight on the Danish side of the Øresund bridge-and-tunnel link, which has been a major entry point for migrants and refugees hoping to start a new life in Sweden.
The measures are aimed at keeping out undocumented migrants and come after Sweden -- which has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation -- said it could no longer cope with the unregulated flow of new arrivals.
A temporary fence has already been erected at Copenhagen Airport's Kastrup station, where trains will be stopped for the mandatory controls, to prevent people from trying to slip across the tracks.
""It's as if we are building a Berlin Wall here. We are going several steps back in time,"" said Michael Randropp, a spokesman for the local Kystbanen commuters' association.
The re-introduction of border controls means that travellers between the two Nordic countries will have to show their passports for the first time in over half a century, and deals yet another blow to Europe's cherished passport-free Schengen system.
Several other European Union countries, including Germany, Austria and France, also re-imposed border checks last year as the continent grappled with its biggest refugee crisis since World War 2.
More than one million migrants reached Europe in 2015, most of whom were refugees fleeing war and violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
Sweden, a country of 9.8 million people known for its generous asylum policies, took in an estimated 160,000 asylum seekers last year alone.
Delays, fines
But the inflow has strained the country's capacity to take care of the newcomers and authorities recently warned they would no longer be able to provide housing for everyone.
As the public mood shifted, the government began reversing its open-door policy.
Some temporary border controls were already re-introduced on November 12th, after which the number of weekly arrivals dropped from a peak of 10,500 to some 3,500 by mid-December, according to Sweden's Migration Agency.
In a further attempt to regain control over the flood of people arriving via Denmark, the Swedish parliament last month passed a temporary law making transport companies responsible for ensuring that those arriving via the 8-kilometre (5-mile) Øresund crossing carry valid photo ID.
Anyone who fails to provide the necessary documents will be turned back, and travel operators who fail to comply risk a fine.
""I believe that these ID checks will be effective. More will have to seek asylum in other countries,"" Migration Minister Morgan Johansson recently told the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter.
Aside from the inconvenience the checks are expected to cause -- especially for the roughly 8,600 daily commuters between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmö -- the new measures have annoyed Danish travel operators for financial reasons.
Danish train company DSB has already threatened to levy a supplementary charge on passengers crossing the strait to cover the costs of the checks.
And the Danish HH Ferries Group said it had reported Sweden to the EU for unfair competition after being required to pay for identity checks.
The company argues that the consortium operating the Øresund Bridge, and which is partly owned by the Swedish government, was given special treatment because it was not required to help fund the measures.
The border controls have also irked the Danish authorities, who are waiting to see if they will end up with a buildup of migrants stuck at their border.
The migration crisis has been a major point of contention between the two neighbours, with Denmark's right-wing government actively discouraging migrants and refugees from settling in the country.
It took in only about 18,000 asylum seekers last year."

According to research carried out by newspaper Politiken, 70 percent of new Danish citizenships in 2014 were to people from primarily Muslim countries. That figure has fallen drastically to 21 percent this year.
In the same period, Denmark has begun to allow double citizenship, increasingly the likelihood of nationalisation applications from Western countries.
Støjberg said the figures show that the curbs, which her ministry was responsible for implementing, have had the desired effect.
“There is no doubt that this is because the demands have been increased. For example, the language requirement, being able to provide for oneself, staying away from criminality and passing certain tests,” she said.
“In my view there is no doubt at all that it is much easier to integrate a Christian American than a Muslim Somali,” Støjberg said.

The citizenship rules introduced in 2015 by the then-Liberal government with the support of Denmark’s other right wing parties included more stringent language demands, financial autonomy, a higher score in the citizenship test and stricter rules relating to criminal records.

“It is clear that if you come from other parts of the world, you have to exert yourself somewhat harder to, for example, learn the language,” Støjberg said.
She added she would begin talks over potential further curbs in the coming week.
“I have tightened up [on citizenship] once, and a new set of curbs is now on its way. People that have committed gang crime must not be allowed citizenship,"" she said.
“The aim of tough rules is to make Danish citizenship something to strive for,” she added."

Denmark’s foreign minister called for more foreign aid, increased European help to Italy and a stronger effort to combat human smuggling after as many as 700 migrants were feared drowned Sunday after their packed boat capsized off Libya.
The weekend’s tragedy was described as the deadliest such disaster to date in the Mediterranean.
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Italy's coast guard said only 28 people had survived the wreck. Their testimonies suggested there had been about 700 people on board the 20-metre (70-foot) fishing boat, officials said.

“The thing is, the more we do to rescue the refugees, the more floats and dinghies the human smugglers will set in the sea. Therefore there needs to be other efforts. First off, we need to do everything we can to prevent this refugee crisis. There should be more development aid – not less,” Lidegaard told Ritzau.
In addition to increasing foreign aid, Lidegaard said that EU nations need to answer Italy’s “cry for help”.
“The EU needs to assist Italy more than it currently does and that is something we are willing to look at,” he said.
The foreign minister said that Europe should also work with local authorities in northern Africa.
“There is a need to train law enforcement officials on the other side and ensure that they can carry out actions against the human smugglers,” Lidegaard said.
The refugees trying to reach Europe with the help of human smugglers are generally fleeing conflict or persecution in places such as Eritrea, Afghanistan and Syria, or poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
Sunday’s tragedy is the latest in a growing catalogue of mass drownings of migrants attempting to reach the European Union on overcrowded, unseaworthy boats run by people smugglers who are able to operate out of Libya with impunity because of the chaos engulfing the north African state.
The most serious incident prior to Sunday occurred off Malta in September 2014. An estimated 500 migrants drowned in a shipwreck caused by traffickers deliberately ramming the boat in an attempt to force the people on board onto another, smaller vessel.
In October 2013, more than 360 Africans perished when the tiny fishing boat they were crammed onto caught fire within sight of the coast of Lampedusa.
That horrific tragedy was described at the time as a wake-up call to the world but 18 months later there is no sign of a let-up in the numbers attempting the perilous crossing in search of a better life in Europe.
The latest disaster comes after a week in which two other shipwrecks left an estimated 450 people dead.
If the worst fears about Sunday's tragedy are confirmed, it will take the death toll since the start of 2015 to more than 1,600 people.
Aid organisations are calling for the restoration of an Italian navy search-and-rescue operation known as Mare Nostrum which was suspended at the end of last year.
Italy scaled back the mission after failing to persuade its European partners to help meet its operating costs of nine million euros (67 million kroner, $9.7 million) per month amid divisions over whether the mission was unintentionally encouraging migrants to attempt the crossing.
Mare Nostrum has been partially replaced by a much smaller EU-run operation called Triton which has a fraction of the assets and manpower deployed by Italy."

In addition to immigration policies, the study takes into account factors such as economic stability, income, equality and employment prospects for immigrants.
The heavy presence of the Noric countries at the top end of the list is in no small part due to a positive worldwide perception of their economy, as well as efforts to achieve wage equality, according to the report.
Several Middle East countries, including Saudi Arabia (no. 15) and Qatar (no. 23) have a high proportion of immigrants per capita.
The relatively low placings of these countries is related to the absence of efforts to integrate migrant workforce populations, writes US News and World Report.

The Foreign Ministry announced the new initiative on Tuesday, along with a 75 million kroner commitment by the Danish government to fund organizations that will be affected by Trump's move to reinstate what is formally known as the ‘Mexico City Policy' but more popularly described as the “global gag rule”.
“I am worried about the consequences that the American decision to reinstate the Global Gag Rule can have on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable women and girls,” Tørnæs said. “Therefore I have gathered an alliance of European countries including Denmark which, like us, have this topic high on their agenda.”
The ministry said that Denmark took the initiative to enlist ministers from other EU countries to sign a joint letter to EU urging action to help counteract the American decision. According to a report in Politiken, the other signatories are Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium and the UK.
The Netherlands had previously announced plans to create a fund to finance access to reproductive education, birth control and abortion in developing countries.
Tørnæs said that she has encouraged the EU to at least match the Danish funds.
“It’s important that the organizations that world with family planning and sexual and reproductive rights aren’t forced to shut down their efforts. Denmark cannot achieve this alone, but I have found 75 million kroner and I have together with the other like-minded European countries encouraged the EU commission to do the same,” she said.
According to the World Health Organization, approximately 22 million women worldwide receive unsafe abortions every year, with the vast majority of those living in developing countries that would be affected by the Trump administration decision.
Marie Stopes International, an NGO that provides contraception and access to safe abortions in 37 countries around the world, estimates that the loss of US funding would cause 6.5 million unintended pregnancies, 2.1 million unsafe abortions and 21,700 maternal deaths during Trump's first term."

Dubbed ‘the spitting man’ by the Danish press, the man was caught by an Information photographer spitting from a bridge onto a group of migrants walking along the motorway on the island of Lolland.
The man was charged with violating article 266b of Denmark’s penal code, best known as “the racism paragraph”. According to the indictment, the man also yelled derogatory terms at the migrants, and gave them the finger.
TV2 reported that rather than go to court, the man decided on Wednesday to pay a 5,000 kroner ($764) fee.
Police prosecutor Jeanette Wincentz Andersen said that she “didn’t know” if the man was admitting to racism by agreeing to pay the fine.
“If he denied his guilt, then it would have gone to court and then it would have been up to the judge to determine whether he should be convicted and pay a fine. Now he has accepted a fine so it must imply that he has admitted his guilt,” Andersen told TV2.
The spitting incident occurred on September 7th, 2015 when large groups of migrants attempted to walk from Denmark to Sweden. That large influx has also resulted in a number of human smuggling charges against Danes who offered the walking migrants a ride.

					08:32 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Here's what Denmark's new immigration bill means for you,"Danish lawmakers on Tuesday passed a controversial bill aiming to make the Scandinavian country a less attractive destination for refugees and migrants.
The bill includes several different measures, including allowing police to confiscate valuables and cash from migrants. Here are some of the main points:
-- Police will be able to search migrants' luggage and seize cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than that amount. Wedding rings and other items of sentimental value will be exempt.
Earlier this month the amount was raised from 3,000 kroner amid a public outcry and comparisons to Nazi Germany's seizing of gold and valuables from Jews and others during World War II. After thorny negotiations, parliamentary backing for the proposal was secured a few days later by removing any upper limits on the value of items with a sentimental value.
The government has defended the searches, arguing that people who have lived their entire lives in Denmark may also be asked to sell valuables to qualify for social benefits.
Few people believe the seized cash and goods will raise any significant amounts of money.
""We are saying that if you want to come to Europe you should stay clear of Denmark,"" said Martin Henriksen, a spokesman for the anti-immigration Danish People's Party.
Switzerland has since the 1990s confiscated cash amounts, but not material goods, from people seeking asylum in the country if they exceed 1,000 Swiss francs ($995, 913 euros).
-- Refugees granted a lower form of protection status under Danish law, meaning people fleeing indiscriminate violence rather than individual persecution, have to wait three years instead of one year before applying for family reunifications. Once the application has been filed, the process can take years.
The waiting time has prompted allegations that Denmark will violate the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Refugee Convention.
Amnesty International said the move could ""have a devastating impact on families, including their rehabilitation from experiences of trauma and their ability to integrate and adapt to life in a new country.""
-- For permanent residency applications, Danish language requirements have been raised from Danish 1 to Danish 2, and the person must have been employed for 2.5 of the past three years rather than three out of five years.
Foreigners can first apply for permanent residency after six years in the country instead of the current five. That period can however be reduced to four years for foreigners who have fulfilled four supplementary conditions: displaying 'active citizenship' by participating in civic organizations or the passing of a citizenship test, steady employment for four of the past 4.5 years, an annual salary of 270,000 kroner for two years prior to application, or the completion of Danish 3 language courses.
-- Residence permits are shortened to two years from five for those granted a higher form of protection, meaning asylum seekers facing persecution based on their race, nationality, religion, political beliefs or association with a specific social group.
-- Refugees have to pay the transportation costs of family members they bring to the country.
-- A fee of 3,700 kroner (500 euros, $540) will be introduced on applications for permanent residence permits.
-- The selection of 500 yearly UN quota refugees will be based on their ""integration potential"" which includes criteria like language abilities, education, work experience, age and motivation.
The criteria were first introduced in 2005 by a right-wing government but were later rolled back.

SSI has warned Danish hospitals about the possible return of diphtheria and Metroxpress reported that asylum seekers have also been found to carry tuberculosis and malaria.
Unlike some European countries, Denmark does not screen arriving refugees for illnesses but Fuursted said that policy might change.
“There is no doubt that infectious diseases are coming in with the refugees that we aren’t used to. There have been discussions on whether all refugees who come to Denmark should be screened,"" he said.
Health Minister Sophie Lunde told Metroxpress that immigration officials and the Danish Health and Medicines Authority (Sundhedsstyrelsen) will discuss possible changes to screening policies.
Officials will also discuss the need to vaccinate arriving asylum seekers, who often come to the country without having been vaccinated against illnesses they risk catching in Denmark.
Denmark doesn’t not vaccinate arriving migrants despite recommendations from the World Health Organization to do so.
“Our position is clear: migrants and asylum seekers should be checked and vaccinated against the illness they are not protected against,” WHO spokesman Robb Butler told Metroxpress."

					14:55 CET+01:00				", The Local,Immigrants boost Denmark's rural towns,"More than one fourth of Denmark’s municipalities saw their populations grow over the past six years due to immigrants and refugees, according to an analysis from online journal Ugebrevet A4.
Working with figures from Statistics Denmark, Ugebrevet A4 found that 64 of Denmark’s 98 municipalities experienced a population decline amongst ethnic Danes between 2008 and 2014. But when immigrants, refugees and their descendants are factored in, 27 of those 64 municipalities actually experienced population growth. Many of the areas where immigrants are reversing population declines are rural communities that have struggled to retain residents. Pia Heike Johansen, a professor at the Danish Centre for Rural Research at the University of Southern Denmark, said that immigrants provide a vital boost to rural areas. “When immigrants move to rural areas, they help to keep local businesses alive. If they settle down and have children, that benefits the local schools and daycare institutions,” Johansen told Ugebrevet A4. “They really mean a lot to the rural municipalities and help ensure a higher level of both public and private services,” she added. Ugebrevet A4 pointed to Vejen in southern Denmark and the central Jutland municipalities of Billund and Ikast-Brande as examples of municipalities that have experienced decreases in their Danish populations but have grown by hundreds of residents thanks to immigrants. The mayor of Vejen, Egon Fræhr, said he is thankful for the newcomers. “It’s terrific that people want to work in our municipality. The immigrants are a part of our community just like all the other residents. Well-performing businesses and job opportunities are vital for a municipality to function, while the last names of the employees isn’t terribly important,” Fræhr told Ugebrevet A4. He added that even though it can be challenging to integrate immigrant children into the local schools and daycares, “we haven’t had big problems with immigration.” North of Vejen in Ikast-Brande, Mayor Cartsen Kissmeyer said the local business community “is dependent on attracting foreign workers”. “If we didn’t have immigration, the companies’ production would be worth less,” he told Ugebrevet A4. Steffen Damsgaard, the chairman for the rural districts’ association Landdistrikternes Fællesråd, said immigrants are helping to keep the parts of Denmark often deridingly referred to as “the rotten banana” alive. “One of the biggest challenges for the outlying municipalities is when the population disappears and the economy erodes. When residents instead choose to settle down, it ensures the foundation for the local economy,” he told Ugebrevet A4.
He cautioned, however, that immigration might not be the solution for every struggling community. “Immigration and refugees shouldn’t be forced upon rural people if they don’t want it. But when a large portion of the population moves away from rural areas, immigrants can definitely contribute to society’s bottom line,” he said. Earlier this year it was reported that in some parts of Denmark, as many in one in four homebuyers is from eastern Europe, helping to turn around moribund housing markets."

					15:34 CET+01:00				", The Local,Danish teen fought off her attacker - now she'll face fine,"A 17-year-old girl who was physically and sexually attacked in Sønderborg will herself face charges for using pepper spray to fend off her assailant.
The teenager told police that she was attacked in central Sønderborg on Wednesday at around 10pm by a dark-skinned English-speaking man. She said the man knocked her to the ground and then unbuttoned her pants and attempted to undress her.
The girl was able to save herself from further assault by using pepper spray on the attacker, but now she may be the one who ends up in legal trouble.
“It is illegal to possess and use pepper spray, so she will likely be charged for that,” local police spokesman Knud Kirsten told TV Syd.
The case has sparked a backlash among some Danes who point to increasing reports of sexual harassment in Sønderborg and other Danish cities at the same time that police say they are stretched too thin to properly carry out their duties.
Numerous readers wrote in the comments section on TV Syd’s story about the incident that they would be willing to pay the girl’s fine, which will most likely be 500 kroner.
The man who attacked the 17-year-old fled from the scene and has not been charged.
Sexual assaults have been in the news in Sønderborg recently after several women in the town reported earlier this month that they sometimes feel harassed by the aggressive behaviour of some male asylum seekers and refugees at the local asylum centre.
It is not known, however, if the assailant in this latest incident was an asylum seeker or refugee.
In related news, a nightclub in Sønderborg is now barring guests from entering if they cannot speak Danish, English or German. Other Danish nightclubs are also reportedly considering similar moves.
Note to readers: Due to a translation error, the story originally described the attacker as ""wearing dark clothing"" when in fact he was described as being ""dark-skinned"". We regret the error."

					19:43 CEST+02:00				",Punvi Kalia,Inclusion in Danish higher education 'a tough task': international students,"The Local’s Punvi Kalia spoke to past and present international students in Denmark about the challenges they faced trying to fit into life in the Scandinavian country.
Recently, a report released by NGO European Network Against Racism concluded that racism plays a key role in migrants’ exclusion in Denmark. The report made reference to verbal or physical threats, ethnic profiling, political trends and limited access to the labour market.
But what about students who are not migrants, who simply come to Denmark to attain further studies, with many of them paying out of their pockets? Do they really feel affected by racism?
Aarhus University, one of the oldest in Denmark, sees thousands of international students coming each year for one or two terms.
There are many events in place to make international students feel included, like free Danish language courses, scholarships as well as free public events giving exposure to Danish culture, but there still remains a struggle for newcomers to fit in.
For 36-year-old Moamen Abdelkawy, a scholarship holder and father of one, exclusion went beyond language barrier and cultural differences. Abdelkawy was accepted to a Master’s degree in Quantitative Economics at Aarhus University under a scheme aimed at highly qualified non-EU students admitted to graduate studies at an eligible Danish university. Abdelkawy, who is from Cairo, came to Denmark in August 2016 and left earlier this month.
“I was very happy the first two months in Denmark, there's no bureaucracy at all and the university is highly organised – and that's coming from someone who has dealt with a lot of universities and working in academia. I got my accommodation through AU housing and my neighbours are some of the best people I have met in my life.
""We explored the city, the weather was amazing and the Aarhus Festival Week was much fun. Compared to Egypt, Denmark is much more organised, more green, and the traffic is much, much better,” said Abdelkawy, who is now back home spending time with family.
His welcome week itself was a preview of what was ahead, especially being the only non-EU student in his programme. In the events during the welcoming week, other international students from various programmes told him that their access to the labour market is limited, and that many of them had taken a year to land a job despite having better qualifications than their Danish counterparts.
Many also criticised Danes for being “not nice” and “miserable,” which surprised Abdelkawy, given the “perfect” image of Denmark he had come to expect from social media such as Facebook.
Abdelkawy says he tried to learn some Danish a few months before arriving in the country. But the Egyptian doesn’t think language is the real barrier for foreigners in Denmark.

“The language is not the problem in Denmark, the real issue here is that when you discover that you're not accepted in that society, with a crazy government that pushes everyone out, and no chance of finding a suitable job. Learning Danish becomes totally useless since there's absolutely no use of that language outside the country,” said Abdelkawy, who by January 2017 had received over 45 rejection emails from different Danish companies.

The Danish concept of ‘hygge’, increasingly well-known internationally due to a foreign media infatuation over the last couple of years, can be a great coping mechanism against the country’s harsh grey winters.
One aspect of hygge is good company, for example sharing dinners and brunches, and while it works for many, some, like Abdelkawy, felt otherwise.
“I was extremely depressed, I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. I never heard about it before but I think I had seasonal affective disorder (SAD). I barely finished my first semester exams. It was still very bad and being surrounded by Danes didn't help. I felt as though I was in a prison and I didn't get better until May when I took the decision to leave Denmark,” he said.
When asked about the university authorities who might have helped in making the situation better for him, Abdelkawy said that “the university is very well organised, but there's a catch, as for everything in Denmark it's only suitable for Danes and they don't care if it's working for others.”
Blanka Eszter Koi, a Hungarian student who was on the Global Nutrition and Health programme at the VIA University, points out similar issues with the academic system at university level in Denmark.
“I do love Denmark and love the culture and don’t want to sound ungrateful or anything, but my study experience here was really bad,” Koi says.
READ ALSO: Denmark falls in international student satisfaction rank
Despite understanding Danish, Koi says she struggled to fit in, particularly when it came to group work assignments.
“Most of the Danes liked to work after school but majority of international students had jobs to go to. This made completing assignments a tough task and gave the impression that the non-Danish students were not sincere towards our studies. It came to a point where the Danes went to the teacher saying that they no longer want to work with international students and eventually the groups were separated – Danes and non-Danes.”
Koi remembers thinking of dropping out during her second year because she simply didn’t feel included.
“At the beginning, the class distribution was 50-50, with a total of 40 students, and in the end only five international students graduated,” she said.
Students in Denmark’s smaller towns, which do not see the influx of international students of main cities Aarhus and Copenhagen, noted similar experiences.

Waseem, whose name has been changed as he is still an active student, is an architecture student from Pakistan at a university in Kolding.
Waseem says that he and fellow South Asian students have experienced discrimination in public places such as 7-Eleven convenience stores, and even by European classmates.
“Although I do not have a problem with my university or the education system per se,” he added, but noted difficulties finding part-time work. Waseem, like his friends from India and Pakistan, has work experience of up to five years in his field, but has failed to land any job other than cleaning, dishwashing or similar unskilled roles.
“There is nothing wrong with putting restrictions when it comes to working hours for us international students, but the problem is the type of jobs offered to us on the basis of our skin colour,” Waseem said. He added that he tried to learn the language, and like Abdelkawy, felt that a lack of acceptance, rather than the language was the problem.
“I was aware of hate crimes in the U.S. and the U.K. and that is why I did not opt for them, but to be honest, what we call soft racism, it is not exactly that soft in Denmark,” he said.
He says that he cannot blame Danes for having certain perceptions about countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan or India, citing media depictions of those countries.
“But I hope something is done, by our government as well as theirs, to make further studies for professionals like me smoother, so that future students from such countries find it easier to survive here, especially when it comes to job opportunities.”
Abdelkawy, who is at present weighing his options in Cairo having been offered a number of European scholarships for the next academic session, said that he found the political reality in Denmark to be different from other western European countries.
“There's something very dangerous in Denmark compared to other European countries . In France or Germany or the U.K. you'll have one or two far right parties that want to push all foreigners out, while the other political main stream is reasonable in that matter. In Denmark, attacks on foreigners come from right and left. The far right party [Danish People’s Party, ed.] is the second biggest party in the parliament, and the current immigration policy is very successful in driving people away from Denmark. I'm a living example.”

These questions are not drawn from an admission test to a prestigious university but from Denmark's renewed exam for anyone aspiring to get Danish citizenship.
The Danes-to-be -- or rather wannabes -- have 45 minutes to answer the intensive multiple choice questionnaire covering the Scandinavian kingdom's history, culture, politics and habits from Viking times to the modern era.
The test can be a gamble for migrants, many of whom are unschooled and striving to decipher the country's tricky language.
And even Danes, who have had a go at the test for fun, have struggled to attain the minimum of 32 correct answers out of 40.
More than two out of three foreigners who gave it a shot in June's session failed the test, figures from the immigration and integration ministry revealed.
Those who failed will be given a second chance in December.

'Applicants not studying'
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg, who has in the past few months signed a series of reforms restricting foreigners' entry and stay on Danish soil, said 35 of the correct answers are included in material distributed to applicants free of charge before the test.
""The relatively high failure rate is due to people not preparing themselves properly and studying the material that is available to all,"" she said.
Foreigners are questioned about the adoption of female suffrage, taxes, electing members of parliament, the queen's role in politics or reinstatement of border controls during the migrant crisis in January 2016.
They are also asked if following a religious belief exempts them from respecting ""other rules that prevail in society"", in addition to several questions about the successive invasions and wars fought on Danish territory.
The predominantly Lutheran country has also thrown in a few questions about its religious identity, including the one about Easter eggs -- to which the correct answer is that they represent fertility.
While major events in Danish history may be useful for new citizens to learn, critics say other questions do little to assess the candidates' integration into their new home country.
'Humour and humanity'
The trivia that foreigners are expected to know includes the release year of the Olsen Gang, a popular Danish film series (1968).
One of its lead actors, Morten Grunwald, admitted even he could not remember when the first film had been released.
""A test like this should not define if one can become a Danish citizen or not. It's about other qualities, such as humour and humanity,"" Grunwald told broadcaster DR.
And when it comes to La Sylphide, few Danes would recall that Auguste Bournonville's ballet from 1836 tells the story of an unfortunate young Scotsman who abandons his fiancee for the ethereal beauty of a sylph and ends up losing both.
""The Danish government is doing what it can to avoid receiving too many people from outside, both refugees and regular immigrants,"" Luc de-Visme, a 70-year-old Frenchman who has lived in the country for 44 years and who sat for the test, told AFP.
Although he ended up passing, he admitted having guessed the answers to eight of the 40 questions.
For citizenship-seekers the grilling does not end at the general knowledge test. Then come the language exams, both oral and written.
Linguist Poul Neergaard said Danish is more difficult to learn than many other languages, not least because Danes barely pronounce their many vowels.
""We swallow half of the words,"" he said.
'Knowledge not memory'
When the general knowledge test was first introduced in 2007 by a centre-right government, the failure rates were even higher than now.
In 2014, the former centre-left coalition made the questions easier and focused the test more on modern Danish society than obscure historical information.

But throughout last year, tens of thousands of migrants arrived in or transited via Denmark, prompting the government to join forces with the far-right Danish People's Party to tighten the screw in the citizenship test, among a slew of measures destined to make the country less attractive for migrants.
Even the opposition Social Democrats were in favour of a stricter test but claim not to have had a role in choosing the questions.
""We wanted to see if the applicants knew a little about the Danish culture and history, not if they have a good memory,"" Social Democrat lawmaker Mattias Tesfaye told AFP.

As part of a hard-line migrant bill passed in January, and made infamous by the so-called ‘jewellery law’ clause, Denmark increased from one year to three years the waiting period for refugees before they can apply to bring their family members into the country.
Human rights experts protested vocally against the provision, saying it was a clear violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Refugee Convention. Many predicted that a legal challenge to the restrictions was inevitable and a suit has now been filed by a group of five Syrian refugees.

“This is our last hope. If this case doesn’t help us, I think that my father will go back to my mother and siblings in Syria,” 16-year-old Anas Omar Alzein told Politiken.
Alzein and his father, 47-year-old Omar Mohammad Alzein have filed the suit along with three other Syrian refugees who want to bring their families to Denmark.
The Syrians’ lawyer, Christian Dahlager, is confident his clients will prevail.
“We need to put a stop to this illegal law. It is not worthy and I firmly and fully believe that we will win all the way through the court system and on up to the Supreme Court,” he told Politiken.
Støjberg has acknowledged that her hard-line reforms could fall foul of international conventions.
""We have gone to the limits of the conventions and it is true that there is a (risk) in relation to the issue of family reunifications. But it's a risk I'm willing to take,"" she told news agency Ritzau in December.
She declined to comment on the Syrians’ lawsuit.
The three-year waiting period for family reunification applies to refugees who are granted temporary protections under a 2014 tightening of the nation’s asylum laws that was approved by the previous government.
The family reunification delay was just one of many restrictions introduced in January and in reality the wait for refugees to bring their family members to Denmark would be much longer than three years when case processing time is included.
Other changes introduced as part of the bill include the aforementioned (and thus far unused) ‘jewellery law’, the establishment of refugee tent camps, tougher language and employment criteria for obtaining permanent residency, shorter residence permits for refugees, higher case costs and new selection criteria for UN quota refugees that emphasizes their “integration potential”."

An estimated 800-850 refugees and migrants arrived in Denmark during the course of Monday, including the first group to arrive by train in Copenhagen.
A train carrying refugees from the harbour town of Rødby arrived in the Danish capital shortly before midnight on Monday. According to TV2, Copenhagen Police registered 30 individuals, including 28 who are seeking asylum in Denmark.
“On top of that we detained two people for illegal residence when they chose not to seek asylum. They will be transferred to the Danish Immigration Service, which will determine whether they should be deported with an entry ban and taken back to where they came from,” police spokesman Kristian Aaskov told TV2.
In a video shot at Copenhagen Central Station, refugees can be heard saying that they don’t want to be registered in Denmark and would prefer to go to Sweden:
According to South Zealand and Lolland-Falster Police, the location of some 300 of the refugees and migrants who arrived in the past two days is unknown.
“We have heard rumours that there have been many private residents who have driven the foreigners further along. That is maybe what has happened despite our warnings that it is actually illegal,” police spokesman Kim Kliver said.
Police on the island of Lolland shut down a motorway to protect the safety of the large group of refugees who set off toward Sweden by foot on Monday. Swedish officials said over 200 people successfully made it to Malmö, presumably by private vehicle. The motorway was closed at 8pm and reopened after 1am.

Danish police said the majority of the group attempting to walk to Sweden – a journey that would take around 50 hours and require several water crossings – had been returned to Rødby.
“We have brought the foreigners who were on the roads between Rødby and Sakskøbing back to Rødby, where they are being housed in a school and a sports hall. It has been a very difficult task that we have tried to carry out with as much empathy and professionalism as possible,” Kliver said.
Police at the border between Denmark and Germany also reported that they stopped a group of 20 refugees and transferred them to a school in Padborg.
Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said at a Monday press conference that around 400 refugees had entered Denmark over the past 24 hours but doubled that number to 800 a few hours later.
""We cannot just ignore our obligations and send them to Sweden without its consent, because then we would be doing the same as many other countries, which is the reason the European asylum system is under massive pressure,"" he said.
While Sweden has become a top EU destination for refugees by issuing permanent residency to all Syrian asylum seekers, Denmark has sought to reduce the influx by issuing temporary residence permits, delaying family reunifications and slashing benefits for newly arrived immigrants."

The signs were posted near the northern Jutland municipality of Thisted, which is home to six asylum centres.
Placed under existing signs, the new ones had a directional arrow and the text ‘Syrien 4426’ and ‘Irak 5317’, the distance in kilometres to the home countries of many of the asylum seekers.
The nationalist Danes’ Party (Danskernes Parti) claimed credit for the idea behind the signs on its website.
“The Danes’ Party has long planned a campaign in Thisted, which overnight on Friday was complemented by hanging street signs near the city, creating a major debate throughout the country,” the party wrote on its website.
The party didn’t say directly whether its members had hung the signs, an illegal act, but rather extended “a huge thank you to those who set up the signs”. The nationalists said that the signs were necessary to create a debate about what impact the asylum centres will have on the local community.
“The Danes’ Party wants to show the migrants the way back. That’s why we’ve started a campaign in Thisted to offer locals an alternative to the insecurity that has arisen in Thisted after the arrival of so many migrants,” party leader Daniel Carlsen said.
Carlsen referred to reports from local women in Thisted who said that they have felt harassed by refugees while out at night.

A tent camp hosting nearly 400 asylum seekers opened in Thisted in November and local officials have confirmed that some of the camp's residents have displayed behaviour that has left young women feeling unsafe in the streets and in area night clubs.
Split opinions
The short-lived presence of the signs were condemned by some and praised by others.
Thisted’s deputy mayor, Ib Poulsen of the anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party, said he saw no problem with the signs.
“We have a finance minister who has said that the migrant influx costs society 11 billion [kroner] per year – and that’s probably low. It could have made a difference to use that money on welfare. I want to have a debate on other ways to use that money. This is a way to create a debate on immigration and that is fine with me,” he told Ekstra Bladet.
Others, including the ruling Venstre party, said the signs were in poor taste.
“We want to reduce the number of asylum seekers in Denmark to the absolute minimum, but telling people to just shove off back to Syria where there is war is distasteful,” party spokesman Marcus Knuth told Jyllands-Posten.
Area resident Signe Marguard Rønn took the signs down along with a friend after seeing photos of them posted to Facebook.
“I think it’s a shame that people who have travelled thousands of kilometres to reach safety are greeted with a sign that shows them the way back and sends a signal to ‘scram’,” she told Jyllands-Posten.
Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants after Finland, Austria, Germany and Sweden. The government expects another 25,000 asylum seekers in 2016."

The man died in hospital two days later.
The man was escorted to Copenhagen Airport by police on Monday as part of a scheduled forced deportation.
He lost consciousness on board the aircraft and was then taken to hospital, but died on Wednesday, the Independent Police Complaints Authority (Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed, DUP) confirmed to news agency Ritzau.
A witness who was on board the aircraft told tabloid newspaper Ekstra Bladet that the incident seemed ""violent"".
“I was in seat 22A, and the Algerian man was in 23F, so I was almost next to him,” the witness, Michael Thorvaldssen, told Ekstra Bladet.
“I could see that there were three officers on him. Two of them were lying on him, and the third was holding him back in his seat. There was also a female officer who was guarding the way for passengers on their way into the aircraft,” Thorvaldssen continued.
The struggle between the man and the police officers lasted for around half an hour, before the Algerian became quiet, according to the witness.
“Shortly after they asked over the loudspeaker whether there was a doctor on board, and it turned out there was. The doctor gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR until an ambulance came and took him away,” he said.
Thorvaldssen also told Ekstra Bladet that he felt the police officers had been “far too rough” in their handling of the situation.
DUP has now begun an official investigation into the incident – a standard procedure when a person dies or is seriously injured when in police custody or care.
Once the investigation is completed, DUP will send a report to the Public Prosecutor (Statsadvokaten) in Copenhagen, which will decided whether any charges will be brought in connection with the man’s death.

After rising slightly for two days, the number of asylum seekers has steadily decreased from a daily average of about 100 to just 17 on Wednesday, according to the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen).
Denmark's integration ministry and the Danish Red Cross, which runs most of the country's asylum centres, declined to comment on whether the fall was due to the border controls.

Finland received 615 asylum seekers between January 4 and January 20, according to the Finnish Immigration Service. The number began to drop in November, from over 800 a week before Sweden introduced its border controls.
Indeed, the European Union's cherished passport-free Schengen area has come under huge strain, as many countries have reintroduced border controls to deal with the flow of migrants trying to reach the wealthy Nordic region from the main landing point in Greece."

					09:47 CET+01:00				", The Local,OPINION: Brexit and Brits in the EU - bargaining chip or afterthought?,"What will happen to reciprocal arrangements between EU countries and the UK when Brits abroad are reduced to an afterthought? Laura Shields of the Liberal Democrats examines the issues faced by anxious Britons.
Last week the British government successfully quashed amendments to its EU withdrawal legislation that would have required it to take proactive action on the rights of British citizens living in the EU and EU nationals in the UK.
The government doesn’t want any constraints on its Brexit negotiations. Its logic is that if it acts unilaterally to guarantee the rights of 3.3 million EU nationals living in the UK then it won’t have any negotiating capital with the EU 27 over the status of us 1.3 million Brits living outside the UK. Reciprocity is the buzzword and let’s not forget it.
As a British migrant living in Belgium I can understand the tactic but it’s more than a little dispiriting to be thought of as a bargaining chip. That said, I’m not even convinced the government does see us that way. Hell - bargaining chip? Afterthought is more likely.
At the moment, most of the political discussion around the twinned fates of Brits in the EU and their EU counterparts is about the ‘right to reside’. This simplistic view does not fully capture the complexity of the practical challenges that Brits living in the EU will face once the UK leaves the EU and we lose our EU citizenship.
I am not alone in this thought. A survey we (Brussels and Europe Liberal Democrats) recently did of 5,000 Brits living in the EU reflects the complexity and anxiety many here feel. It also chimes with a recent Alternative White Paper from Brits in Europe which made detailed policy recommendations to the UK government on how it could pre-emptively protect the rights of its nationals in the EU.
Contrary to the cliché, most British ‘expats’ aren’t wealthy pensioners who’ve retired to the Riviera to live it up in the sun. We heard from a 25-year-old studying in Paris who is worried what the loss of EU citizenship will mean for his job prospects in Europe.
Likewise, a woman living in Spain who is a full time carer for her son with Aspergers worries that he may lose his entitlement to PIP (Personal Independence Payments) and carers. Both are currently guaranteed by reciprocal arrangements between Spain and the UK as part of our EU membership.
And a woman in her thirties working in Ireland is anxious about what will happen to the working rights of her non-EU husband after Brexit. At the moment, Ireland grants non-EU spouses of EU citizens the automatic right to work. But no EU citizenship, means no automatic right to work for the spouse.
The EU Withdrawal bill has now passed to the Lords where Opposition Peers plan to re-introduce the amendments on EU and UK migrants when it has its second hearing next week. So we can expect the legislative ping pong to continue.
In the meantime, we bargaining chips can only wait and hope for a good hand.

					11:54 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Denmark to propose changes to Schengen to enable extended border control,"Denmark is hoping to change the rules of the Schengen agreement to allow border control to continue.
Denmark’s exemption from the Schengen open borders agreement expires on November 12th.
But instead of opening the borders, governments in several EU countries want EU rules to be change to enable extension of the measure for up to four years.
Immigration minister Inger Støjberg, along with counterparts from Germany, Austria, France and non-EU member Norway will propose the rule change at a meeting for justice and interior minister of EU member states in Brussels on Thursday, reports broadcaster DR.
Under current rules, Schengen countries can implement temporary border control for up to six months.
Once the initial six-month period has expired, the European Commission – and not the member state itself – decides whether the temporary border control may be extended, subject to approval by the remaining Schengen countries.
Denmark and the other countries behind the new proposal are calling for the Schengen countries to be able to decide unilaterally to extend their border controls, according to DR’s report.
Should the EU Commission not agree with extensions imposed by individual countries, the onus will then be on the commission to prove border control is not justified.
Although the current border controls were established as a response to a peak in migrant and refugee arrivals in Europe in late 2015, the proposal to be put forth Thursday is based on a need to take preventative measures against terrorism, writes DR.

The EU Commission hold the position that the migrant crisis and outer borders of the EU zone are now under control, nullifying the current justification for extending the temporary border controls, according to the broadcaster.
EU parliament member Morten Helveg Petersen of the Social Liberal (Radikale Venstre) party told DR that he expected the EU parliament to resist the proposal.
“I think many in the EU parliament will be critical of it, because free movement is an important issue, including across borders. If there is strict border control, and everyone has to get out of their cars and show their passports, free movement will clearly be disrupted. It costs money and jobs for freight trucks to queue at borders and many will be concerned with that type of argument, myself included,” Petersen said.
The EU MP said that he would prefer stronger control of the EU’s outer borders.
“I think it is better to tackle the problems we have together, rather than having police and home guard at [Danish border town] Kruså,” he added.

Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Friday lent support to his British counterpart who is seeking a deal that will keep Britain in the European Union.
Copenhagen was the next stop after Poland on David Cameron's whirlwind diplomacy tour aiming to shore up support for a deal.
""I'm not intervening in British politics, but I'm definitely hoping that Britain will remain within Europe,"" said Rasmussen at a joint press conference with the British premier.
EU President Donald Tusk on Tuesday unveiled key proposals to keep Britain in the bloc, including a four year brake on benefit payments for EU migrant workers and protection for countries that do not use the euro currency.
""I support all the elements regarding welfare benefits,"" said Rasmussen, whose centre-right government needs the backing in parliament of the eurosceptic, anti-immigration Danish People's Party.
""These elements will benefit Denmark as well as other member states, not just the United Kingdom,"" he said.
Cameron also said he believed the proposal ""will be good for Britain and other European countries as well.""
""The Europe I believe in has got to be flexible enough to deal with the concerns of countries large and small,"" he said in the Danish capital.
Other European leaders, particularly in central Europe, have been more sceptical, which could make it hard to reach a deal at the February 18-19 meeting of leaders of the 28 EU member nations.
Denmark and Britain have both chosen to remain outside the euro single currency and both countries have at different times requested and received exceptions to various EU regulations.
Cameron has been seeking to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU before a referendum on whether to remain a member, which could be held as early as June."

					14:55 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Danish police use infamous 'jewellery law' for first time,"For the first time since it came into effect in February, Danish police have confiscated cash from arriving migrants using the much-discussed ‘jewellery law’.
The Danish National Police (Rigspolitet) said in a press release that Copenhagen Police caught five people trying to enter the country on falsified documents.
Two men and three women between the ages of 26 and 35 with Iranian nationality were arrested late Tuesday at Copenhagen's airport and placed in detention for using fake documents.
The five arrested had in their possession more than 129,000 kroner and police used the 'jewellery law' provision to confiscated dollars and euros amounting to a total of 79,600 kroner.
The controversial legislation allows police to confiscate cash and valuables above 10,000 kroner from arriving migrants and asylum seekers.
All five who were arrested have asked for asylum, police added.
The ‘jewellery law’ put Denmark squarely in the international spotlight, with human rights groups describing the bill as “despicable” and “vindicative” and some international commentators even drawing parallels to the confiscation of gold and other valuables from Jews by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
The incident at the airport marked the first time that the provision has actually been used.
“Danish police are paying daily attention to whether those asylum seekers and foreigners we encounter who are here illegally have values that can help to finance the costs of their stay. Now, police have found valuables that could be seized for the purpose,” Per Fiig, the chief of the National Police Immigration Centre (NUC), said.
With the massive influx of refugees and migrants to Europe, many from war-torn Syria, Denmark received more than 21,000 asylum applications last year, a 44 percent jump from 2014.
The crisis has led the Nordic country known for its social benefits to tighten border controls which were recently extended until November.
Denmark has criticised the European Union for a lack of security at the bloc's external borders."

					14:20 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Former minister compares Danish People’s Party to Ku Klux Klan,"Henning Dyremose, a former minister with the Danish Conservative party, has been criticised after comparing the nationalist Danish People’s Party (Dansk Folkeparti, DF) to the Ku Klux Klan.
DF spokesperson Martin Henriksen said that the Conservatives should consider ejecting Dyremose from the party, reports news agency Ritzau.
Dyremose said during a broadcast on radio station Radio24syv Thursday that parallels could be drawn between populist political party DF and the racist, extremist American KKK movement.
“I think it’s absurd that a former minister and high-profile politician from the Conservative Party is comparing DF with the Ku Klux Klan, which has lynched people in all possible ways and has acted indecently and deeply, deeply unfairly towards people of another skin colour. The man must be insane,” DF’s immigration spokesperson Henriksen told Ritzau.
Henriksen said he was strongly calling for Dyremose to retract the statement and apologise.
“Many Danish people vote for the Danish People’s Party. They have done so because they are concerned about the trend [of immigration, ed.]. Not because they want to lynch people. So the Conservative Party must clearly state that this is completely unacceptable,” Henriksen added.

Dyremose said during his appearance on Radio24syv that he was “a little regretful” of the comparison, but found it a difficult one not to make.
The former minister described his own experience with the KKK during his youth in the USA.
“Some people were to a great extent socialists with regard to economic politics. They were [part of] the poor working class. But at the same time, they were hateful like mad towards black people,” Dyremose is quoted by Ritzau as saying.
“And that is a little like what I see in the Danish People’s Party: They have actually become socialists in their economic policies, but are hateful with regard in particular to the foreigners that are Muslims,” he said.

Henriksen told the news agency that he saw Dyremose’s words as a direct comparison that the ex-minister could not make any excuse for.
“[The Conservative leadership] should seriously consider whether a person that speaks about the Danish People’s Party in that way should be a member of the Conservative Party,” he said.
The Conservative Party itself has form for controversial statements regarding Muslims, most famously when it released an election campaign poster in 2015 with the slogan “Stop Nazi-Islamism”.
Conservative Party secretary Søren Vandsø told Ritzau via a written message that Dyremose must take responsibility for his own statement.
Dyremose was minister for employment and later finance minister under Poul Schlüter’s Conservative government during the 1980s."

					16:39 CET+01:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Denmark may have illegally deported seriously ill refugees as minister admits poor practice,"Seriously ill asylum seekers may have been refused humanitarian protection in Denmark in breach of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).
Minister for Immigration and Integration Inger Støjberg admitted during a parliamentary consultation on Thursday that her ministry had acted incorrectly in taking more than a year to adjust its processes to comply with the December 2016 ECHR ruling.
“Speaking straight, it took too long [for the ministry] to become aware of the ruling. And it also took too long for the [Danish] interpretation to be put in place,” she said during Thursday’s hearing at Denmark’s Christiansborg parliament, where she was questioned by fellow MPs.
Prior to Thursday’s hearing, newspaper Politiken reported that the ECHR ruling was relevant in 11 cases, in which seven have already resulted in persons leaving Denmark or being deported.
The ministry will now seek to find out where the relevant persons are with a view to reviewing their cases, the newspaper wrote.
The ruling – known as the Paposhvili ruling – did not become known to Støjberg’s ministry, which determines cases related to the granting of humanitarian residence, until March 2017, when it was notified by the Ministry of Justice, reports Ritzau.
Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbours Norway and Sweden had both already implemented the ruling into their practices by that time, according to previous reports.
Following the March 2017 notification, a further two months passed before the immigration ministry had prepared its own interpretation of the judgement for implementation into Danish practice, writes Ritzau.
The ministry viewed its practice for rejecting asylum on humanitarian grounds as already being broadly in line with the ruling.
“But that was wrong,” Støjberg said on Thursday.
It was not until last weekend that the ministry announced a four-week freeze on forced expulsions of rejected asylum seekers who are seriously ill while it further assesses the issue.
The consequence of the ruling for Danish asylum processes is ostensibly the need for more thorough assessment of whether a seriously ill individual is realistically able to access necessary healthcare in their home country before Denmark is able to reject an asylum claim by that individual.
“We have to investigate more. But that in no way means that the final decision for any particular case would have been different,” Støjberg said.
“Our practice will still be strict,” she added.
“In this instance, there was a regrettable course of events, which I as minister am obviously not satisfied with,” she said.
Støjberg said that a heavy workload in her ministry was one of the reasons for the breakdown in correct practice.
The ministry has no determined set of guidelines for how to follow new rulings made by the European Court of Human Rights, she said.
Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the opposition Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) party said questions over the issue had been left unanswered.
“You admit that seriously ill refugees have been sent out of Denmark, possibly illegally. I want to ask you whether you can see yourself how shocking that is,” Schmidt-Nielsen said to Støjberg during the hearing.
The minister did not answer the question as the allotted time for the hearing elapsed. Schmidt-Nielsen said she would repeat the question in writing and at a follow-up parliamentary hearing.

Denmark’s opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs grants it exceptions from EU asylum measures, but PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt said that the nation would lend its support to the EU’s plan and increase its contributions to the Triton maritime frontier mission.
“I expect that today [the EU] will increase contributions to the Triton operation so we can save more lives, and Denmark will also contribute to that,” Thorning-Schmidt told the national press before leaving for a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels later on Thursday.

The PM stressed however that Denmark would “under no circumstances” take in a greater portion of refugees that come to Europe.
“Denmark is out of the shared asylum policies and we will not contribute to a different distribution [of refugees]. Overall, I don’t think there is much appetite for that. It would mean that some countries would take in considerably more refugees than they do today,” she said.
Thorning-Schmidt said she would use Thursday’s meeting in Brussels to encourage other European countries to increase their foreign aid.
“Denmark is one of the countries that assumes a large responsibility. And one of the things I will encourage my colleagues to do is to get them to also contribute 0.7 percent of their GDP to foreign aid,” she said.
Thorning-Schmidt said that with increased foreign aid, African countries could create better conditions for their people and provide assistance closer to the source of the problem.
In addition to stepping up the Triton operation, the EU will also try to capture or destroy human trafficking boats, something the Danish PM said was essential.
“We need to help capture these human smugglers. These are incredibly cynical people who first drain these poor people for their money and then send them out in decrepit boats. We need to do everything we can to catch the smugglers, hold them responsibile for their crimes and if it is possible to destroy their boats, then we should also do that,” Thorning-Schmidt said.
The EU’s plan also calls for greater cooperation efforts with the countries bordering war-torn Libya, which is viewed as the epicentre of the Mediterrean migrant crisis.
Thorning-Schmidt said the problems in Libya make it impossible for the EU to adopt the ‘Australian model’ in which arriving boats of refugees are denied entry and sent back.
“The Australian model can’t work, because Australia cooperates with Indonesia, with whom they have a good relationship. That’s why we can’t do it. Libya is not a state and we don’t have any cooperation with them,” the Danish PM said.
