					11:52 CET+01:00				", The Local,"Rejected asylum seekers at Danish expulsion centre missed registration 10,000 times: report","Rejected asylum seekers and other foreign citizens facing deportation due to criminality at the controversial Kærshovedgård expulsion centre failed to meet registration requirements on thousands of occasions, according to a report.
Residents at the Jutland centre are not incarcerated but are required to live at the centre and register with authorities there up to seven times weekly.
But registrations have been missed 10,057 times since the centre was opened in 2016, Central and West Jutland Police have confirmed according to a report by newspaper Jyllands-Posten.
Some have absconded completely while others have absented themselves for long or short periods before returning, according to the report.
As such, a single individual can be responsible for large quantities of missed registrations.
243 people have been charged by police for failing to register, while other charges for failure to comply with rules relating to staying on the site have also been made.
The so-called udrejsecenter (departure or expulsion centre) houses rejected asylum seekers who have not yet left Danish territory, for example due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.
Others do not agree with the outcome of their asylum application or are unable to be voluntarily returned to their home countries due to the danger they believe that will place them under.
The facility is home to 189 people at the time of writing.
In October 2017, residents at the centre protested at what they called 'intolerable' circumstances surrounding their status.
An expert told The Local that living conditions at the centre had been proven by studies to cause psychological damage.

Denmark's prosecution service has now designated a special prosecutor to deal with the missed registration cases, according to Jyllands-Posten, with two days since the turn of the year having seen cases at Herning City Court.
63 foreign citizens have reportedly been prosecuted over the issue, with fines and short prison sentences given to some while others have been acquitted.
Defence lawyer Kaare Kristensen criticised the legal process as futile, with the majority of residents having no means of earning money or paying back the fines given their status as non-residents.
Kristensen and fellow defence lawyer Jakob Fastrup both said that they had experienced clients being pleased to receive prison sentences. The individuals said that prison was a preferable place to be detained than the isolated expulsion centre, according to Jyllands-Posten's report.
Immigration minister Inger Støjberg told Jyllands-Posten that residents of the centre had ""no business being in Denmark"".
""Until we can get them out, we need to keep track of where they are staying, namely at Kærshovedgård. If they don't stay there, we''ll punish them and put them in prison,"" the minister added.

The 31-year-old man was arrested shortly before Christmas for his role in a failed terror plot that was hatched with a 21-year-old Syrian man in November 2016.
According to police, the two men planned to stab people at random in Copenhagen and then detonate one or more bombs in the Danish capital.
Their plan was thwarted when the younger man was stopped attempted to cross the border from Germany to Denmark. The 21-year-old, also a Syrian asylum seeker, was reportedly carrying 17,000 matches, two kitchen knives and six walkie-talkies when the German police arrested him.
The two men were reportedly recruited and brought together by Isis. The younger of the two was convicted by a German court in July 2016, when it was documented that he had declared in writing that he was willing to kill in the name of the terrorist group.
The foiled plot was an apparent suicide mission. When crossing into Denmark, the 21-year-old had no change of clothes and just a small amount of cash. Farewell letters and bomb-making instructions were found in his phone.
The 31-year-old who on Monday had his police custody extended through June 11th has declared himself innocent.
Monday’s court proceedings in Copenhagen occurred behind closed doors and prosecutor Sonja Hedegaard was unwilling to provide any additional details about the case, including when the man is expected to face trial."

					09:46 CEST+02:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Harder for Denmark to return asylum seekers within EU: report,"It has become more difficult for Denmark to return asylum seekers to other European countries in which they were previously registered.
Ministry of Immigration and Integration figures show a drop in the proportion of people who left Denmark on this basis, newspaper Kristeligt Dagblad reports.
In 2013 and 2014, other European countries refused to accept returning asylum seekers in 10.7 and 22.5 percent of cases respectively.
That measure increased to 48 percent in 2016 and 34 percent in 2017.
Marlene Wind, a professor at the University of Copenhagen who specialises in EU law and politics, said she was surprised at the lack of agreement between Denmark and European countries on how to manage migrants that move between states.
“The Dublin rules state that there must be reciprocity in relation to asylum seekers whose cases have already been assessed in another EU country. That means it should be possible to send an asylum seeker back to the first country in which that person was registered,” Wind told Kristeligt Dagblad.
“So it surprises me that this is not working. But it shows, as experts have said for a year, that the Dublin Regulation is not working,” the professor continued.
Government leaders from across the EU last week met a summit in Brussels, where the issue of how to manage migration and refugees was top of the agenda.
At the summit, Germany secured an agreement with other EU countries to send some of its asylum seekers back to EU states in which they were originally registered after arriving in Europe, in accordance with the Dublin Regulation.
Researcher Catharina Sørensen of Danish thinktank Tænketanken Europa said one of the problems with returning asylum seekers was historical precedent.
“During the migration crisis [in 2015, ed.], several countries failed to register asylum seekers, who were then able to trickle up through Europe.
“Now Germany is pushing for the rules to be followed. But there is a risk of the system breaking down because there remains a strong desire to limit migration,” Sørensen told Kristeligt Dagblad.

The Swedish requirement for ID checks at the border between the two countries has resulted in 10,000 people being turned away from the ferry, that connects the Danish town of Helsingør with Helsingborg in Sweden.
Almost all of the rejections were due to normal travellers forgetting to bring their papers, reports Danish broadcaster DR.
ID and border checks were introduced on 4th January this year in an effort to prevent asylum seeker without papers from travelling to Sweden to seek asylum.
Only 200 hundred of the 10,000 recorded refusals during 2016 were potential asylum seekers, according to the report.
""The majority of the people we refuse boarding are Scandinavian citizens, mostly Swedes. We're obviously all used to travelling in a region where mobility is in flow,"" Henrik Rørbæk, administrative director of HH Ferries, told DR.
""It is a big procedure for the sake of relatively small figures. And in general, the flow of asylum seekers up here has not been very great. It also shouldn't be any secret that this is costing us large amounts each month,"" Rørbæk continued.
Rørbæk told DR that the ID checks cost the company three million Swedish kronor ($325,000) every month.
Over three million passengers passed through HH's ID checks in 2016, reports DR.
The company must pay fines of up to 50,000 kronor ($5,400) every time a passenger is stopped by Swedish border control without ID.
""Most people are understanding, but many others blame us for not being able to travel. So if I could have a little Christmas present, it would be that we found more convenient ways in which to maintain the border checks, so that they don't disadvantage individual travellers,"" said Rørbæk.
The director added that his company did not take any political position with regard to the ID checks.
Opposition party Enhedslisten (The Red-Green Alliance) decried the ID checks as a 'waste of resources'.
""These figures show that this border control is a bit silly. It does not stop criminals or asylum seekers, and in practice just cost money and inconveniences people,"" legal spokesperson Pernille Skipper told DR.
But Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told the broadcaster that she was not about to reconsider border control.
""We know that things can change very quickly and that a large number of asylum seekers who possibly want to travel on to Sweden might come here, and get stuck here, so as long as the Swedes maintain their ID checks, I see no reason why we should lift our border control,"" Støjberg said.
Martin Henriksen of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party told DR that if it was up to his party, it would ""always be necessary to show a passport to enter Denmark. Even for people coming from Sweden."""

The assault took place in the southern Jutland town of Haderslev, where local Danish women earlier this year reported that they had been sexually harassed by asylum seekers.
Police confirmed that the man has sought asylum in Denmark and currently resides in Beredskabscenter Haderslev, one of the 80 asylum centres across the country.
The man’s Monday court appearance was held behind closed doors and a police spokesman told broadcaster TV2 that the suspect would neither speak to police or the court.
South Jutland Police said that the rape occurred at a school building in Haderslev at 3.30am on Saturday.
“We received a report from a concerned resident who had heard yelling and screaming from the school. We therefore quickly dispatched officers to the scene, where a shocked woman was seen coming out from Sønder Otting Skole,” spokesman Anders Hansen told Jydske Vestkysten.
Police said the man was still on the scene when officers arrived.
“He was nearly caught in the act because he stood there practically zipping his pants up when we found him,” Hansen said.
The 19-year-old victim was taking to a nearby hospital where personnel confirmed that she had been raped.
The 24-year-old asylum seeker will be held in detention until August 11th as police continue their investigation."

					16:29 CEST+02:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Syrian asylum seeker remains detained in Denmark over terror case,"A judge at Copenhagen City Court on Monday extended the custody of a Syrian citizen suspected of being involved in plans to commit terrorism.
There is reason to believe that the 31-year-old from Syria intended to commit an act of terror in Copenhagen in November 2016, the judge found, and thereby extended the man’s custody by a further four weeks.
The man, who is an asylum seeker in Sweden, was arrested on December 21st 2017.
Police believe he was working together with a 21-year-old compatriot who was given a prison sentence in Germany in 2017 in connection with the same case. The 21-year-old was sentenced to six and a half years in jail.
According to charges raised by Copenhagen Police against the 31-year-old, the pair planned to attack members of the public in Copenhagen with knives before then detonating one or more bombs.
The plans were foiled when the 21-year-old was stopped at the border with Denmark and later arrested by police in Germany.
During his trial in Germany, it was revealed that the Islamic State (Isis) terror group put the two individuals in contact with each other.
Evidence showed that the 21-year-old had declared himself prepared to kill in the name of Isis, the court in the German case heard.
“We must assume that there was an intention to detonate several bombs,” the judge in that court case said.
Prosecution lawyer Sonja Hedegaard declined on Monday to confirm when a decision would be made over whether the man will be indicted in the case.
Court proceedings in the case have thus far taken place behind closed doors. As such, the nature of evidence against him is unclear.

					14:50 CET+01:00				", The Local,"One week after minister admitted mistakes, ill asylum seeker returns to Denmark","A refugee from Afghanistan who is suffering from heart disease has returned to Denmark, where he was previously refused asylum, a week after immigration minister Inger Støjberg admitted incorrect practise by her ministry.
During a parliamentary consultation last week, Støjberg said that her ministry had acted incorrectly in taking more than a year to adjust its processes to comply with a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling over the deportation of seriously ill asylum seekers.
Broadcaster DR reported on Thursday that Afghan national Naser Hosseini, who has a heart condition, has returned to Denmark despite having previously been refused humanitarian asylum.
Hosseini is unable to obtain the necessary medicine for his condition in Kabul, according to DR’s report.
The ECHR ruling, known as the Paposhvili ruling, is based on a Belgian case involving a man from Georgia. The EU court found that Belgium could not deport the man given his seriously, although not terminally ill condition.
According to the ruling, generally available treatment for the relevant condition in the country to which rejected asylum seekers are returned is not sufficient on its own for expulsion of seriously ill individuals.
The Ministry of Immigration and Integration, which determines cases related to the granting of humanitarian residence, did not become aware of the December 2016 ECHR ruling until March 2017, when it was notified by the Ministry of Justice, reports Ritzau.
Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbours Norway and Sweden had both already implemented the ruling into their practices by that time, according to previous reports. It was not until January this year that the Danish immigration ministry announced a four-week freeze on forced expulsions of rejected asylum seekers who are seriously ill while it further assesses the issue.
“In this instance, there was a regrettable course of events, which I as minister am obviously not satisfied with,” Støjberg said at last week’s hearing, adding that a heavy workload in her ministry was one of the reasons for the breakdown in correct practice.
The ECHR ruling has been reported to have been overlooked in 11 Danish cases, in which seven have already resulted in persons leaving Denmark or being deported.
Støjberg would not confirm whether Hosseini was one of those seven deportations, citing confidentiality in individual cases.
At last week’s parliamentary hearing, the minister confirmed that her department would seek to find out where the relevant persons are with a view to reviewing their cases.

					07:00 CET+01:00				", The Local,A record number of asylum seekers left Denmark voluntarily last year,"Throughout the course of 2016, 532 asylum seekers voluntarily left Denmark, numbers from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) released this week revealed.
According to broadcaster DR, which first reported on the statistics, that is the highest number ever and also the first time that asylum seekers leaving Denmark on their own accord outnumber those whose applications were rejected.
Three out of four of those who left did so before their cases had been processed. According to Jacob Jørgensen, an IOM spokesman in Copenhagen, most of those who left returned to Iran, Iraq or Afghanistan. There were also a significant number of voluntary returns among nationals of Russia and Ukraine.
Many cited long waiting times in Danish asylum centres, ill family members in their home countries and false expectations as the primary reasons for leaving.
“There are probably just as many reasons as there are people. We often hear about illness in the family causing people to want to quickly return home. Others are disappointed because their expectations, which may have been built up by human smugglers, did not match reality,” Jørgensen told news agency Ritzau.
The Danish Refugee Council cautioned against drawing the conclusion that those who left Denmark didn’t need help to begin with.
“Some of them may have travelled back and then left their home countries again to seek asylum again. But beyond that I would say that if people don’t want to seek asylum in Denmark then it is fine that they go back [home] again,” the council’s head of asylum, Eva Singer, told DR.
Denmark, with its population of 5.7 million, accepted 6,072 asylum seekers in 2016, a sharp drop-off from the roughly 21,000 who came to the Nordic nation in 2015."

					13:03 CET+01:00				", The Local,Danish police taking asylum seekers' phones,"Danish police have taken the mobile phones of at least 55 unaccompanied minor asylum seekers in recent months, according to a report from Politiken.
Police officers are taking the phones in an attempt to verify the identity and home country of the asylum seekers, a Danish National Police spokesman confirmed.
“If you come to the country and say that you are from Syria but don’t have anything but your blank expression to prove it, then mobile phones are the best way to ensure that you’re telling the truth or whether all of your calls turn out to be to Ghana,” Richard Østerlund la Cour told Politiken.
He said that all of the minors get their phones back after police have confirmed their identities, but Politiken reported that some minors have been without their phones for months and left unable to contact their family members.
After the publication of Politiken’s report on Tuesday morning, a number of politicians called on police to speed up the process. La Cour later told broadcaster DR that police are also sometimes taking the phones of adult asylum seekers as well and there is therefore a backlog causing delays in returning them.
“Everyone is aware of the situation in the second half of 2015, when we received more asylum seekers than ever before and that has challenged us in terms of both resources and capacity,” he said.
Over 2,000 unaccompanied minors sought asylum in Denmark last year, compared to the historic yearly average of 250.
La Cour said the Danish National Police were “aware” of the problem and working on getting the phones back to asylum seekers “faster than we have thus far”.
According to Politiken's report, many of the minors have been without their phones for upwards of one month. In one case, the phone of an underage asylum seeker was held for six months but police found evidence on the phone to tie him to a human smuggling case.
Save the Children Denmark (Red Barnet) criticized the police for holding on to the phones of minors for so long.
“One makes the youths, who are already so vulnerable, even more marginalized by taking their phones. They lose their photos, emails, and the numbers for their family and friends and are suddenly left alone,” the organization’s senior consultant Gitte Jakobsen said.
The phone confiscations are not directly tied to Denmark’s recently-passed – and much-discussed – ‘jewellery law’ but rather under existing rules that allow police to take the phones if they are “assumed to be of importance for establishing a foreigner’s identity”."

According to a report in Jyllands-Posten, DIS suspected that roughly 800 asylum seekers were lying about their age and thus asked the University of Copenhagen's Department of Forensic Medicine (Retsmedicinsk Institut) to run tests to verify just how old the asylum seekers really are.
Using X-rays of their teeth and finger bones, the institute concluded that 74 percent of those tested – or around 600 individuals – are actually adults.
The number of age tests requested by DIS thus far in 2016 more than doubles those performed in 2015, which was in itself a record year for age verifications. The Department of Forensic Medicine said it is likely to have performed 1,000 age tests by the end of the year.
In the Danish asylum system, unaccompanied minors are given a number of advantages over adults, including the ability to bring their parents to Denmark.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said the large number of apparent age cheats is proof that the Danish asylum system is working as it is supposed to.
“The Danish Immigration Service makes a major effort to expose those who are cheating and is also working on how it can happen even faster,” she told Jyllands-Posten.
But the head of asylum at the Danish Refugee Council warned that the age test results may not be as simple as they seem.
“There are many of these young people who don’t know precisely how old they are because it is not something that is registered in their home countries in the same way as it is in Denmark,” Eva Singer told Jyllands-Posten.
She added that Danish immigration authorities often rely solely on the results of the age tests and disregard information to the contrary.
“We can see it, for example, with Afghans. The [Danish] authorities say that everything can be falsified in Afghanistan and therefore they won’t accept paperwork. In that situation, we can have a guy who has papers showing that he is 18 but if the age test says 18, then it’s 18,” she added.
DIS denied that it disregards paperwork that might contradict the results of an age test and a spokeswoman said that the agency as a rule of thumb always “accepts a difference of one year between the youngest age within the likely age span [of the tests, ed.] and the age that the applicant reports”.
“If the [age test] result’s most likely span is 18-19, for example, and the applicant as report 17 years, then we set the age at 17 years,” Teresa McNair wrote in a statement to Jyllands-Posten."

New numbers released by the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen – DIS) on Wednesday revealed that May was another record month for the number of asylum seekers in Denmark.
Some 879 asylum seekers came to the country in May, which is the highest monthly figure in years. In comparison, there were 556 asylum seekers in April, and 723 in May last year.

The rising numbers indicate that 2015 may become another record year. According to DIS, 2,853 asylum seekers came to Denmark between January 1st and May 31st, 2014, whereas 2,995 have done so in the same period this year.
The number of asylum seekers in Denmark nearly doubled in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013.
Part of the explanation stems from the fact that an increasing number of Eritrean citizens are being granted asylum following the uproar surrounding a DIS report that claimed that it was safe to send refugees back to Eritrea. That report was disavowed by its one and only named source and heavily criticized by those with knowledge of Eritrea. The government eventually admitted it had 'doubts' about the report and ultimately decided to grant refugee status to nearly all Eritreans seeking asylum in Denmark.

In March, Denmark welcomed only 21 Eritrean refugees, while the number increased to 76 in April and 214 in May.
The rising number of asylum seekers are unlikely to be a welcome development for Venstre leader Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his allies in the blue bloc.

Immigration and asylum were major themes throughout the recent election, with Rasmussen’s blue bloc campaigning on implementing tighter restrictions.
Rasmussen argued during the election that it would be too late to take action after the summer.
“We cannot wait till October because we know that it is in the summer months that the pressure is greatest. That’s why we have to take action now,” he said at a press conference the week before the election."

A National Police document detailing the figure was seen and reported by Radio24syv.
The unaccounted-for persons could either be in Denmark, a second country or have travelled home.
The National Police believes the majority of the unaccounted-for persons to have left Denmark during the three years over which the total has accumulated, Helga Lund Laursen, who heads the Nationalt Udlændingecenter, the law enforcement’s unit for foreign citizens, said to Ritzau.
“A small number will, based on our experience, turn up again at their previous place of accommodation,” Laursen said.
“The police also encounter some of them as part of their daily patrol work and with their regular work in cooperation with tax and employment authorities in operations against social dumping,” she told the news agency via email.
MP Trine Bramsen, a spokesperson on justice with the opposition Social Democrats, called for a response over the report.
“They could easily be working illegally in Denmark and undermining the Danish labour market, or in the worst case be potential terrorists,” Bramsen said to Radio24syv.
The Social Democrat MP called for police to step up efforts to locate the individuals and said she had requested an explanation of the situation from immigration minister Inger Støjberg.
Naser Khader, justice spokesperson with the Conservatives, a junior party in the coalition government, said he was unconcerned by the reported figures.
“It’s difficult to get by in Denmark without identification papers. So I think there’s only a small number of these people still in the country,” Khader said to Ritzau.
“But if there is knowledge of any of the missing and rejected asylum seekers being criminals or extremists, I absolutely think an effort should be made to track them down,” he told Ritzau.
In addition to the 2,835 unaccounted for rejected asylum seekers, the whereabouts of a further 2,729 persons whose cases are unresolved are also unknown to police.

					15:05 CEST+02:00				",Michael Barrett,Denmark criticised for 'celebrating' plight of asylum seekers in damning report,"A human rights NGO has released a highly critical report on asylum and immigration practices in Denmark.
Denmark’s ‘prison-like’ asylum centres and failure to identify victims of torture, as well as possible detainment of children in unsuitable facilities, were among the concerns raised in the report.
The report, entitled ‘Immigration Detention in Denmark: Where Officials Celebrate the Deprivation of Liberty of “Rejected Asylum Seekers”’, was released last week by the Global Detention Project (GDP), a Geneva-based NGO that promotes the human rights of people who have been detained for reasons related to their non-citizen status.
During the past three years, Denmark has adopted just under 70 immigration-related amendments aimed at intensifying restrictions, dramatically cut back its asylum recognition rate, and called for detaining as many failed refugees as possible, GDP writes on its website.
“This is a gradual and permanent restriction where actually it’s not even necessary because (Denmark) is not under migration pressure. In Sweden, the factual context in terms of people arriving and seeking protection is completely different,” Izabella Majcher, one of the researchers and authors of the report, told The Local.
Majcher noted that a similar analysis of conditions in Denmark’s neighbouring country Sweden, set for release by GDP in June, had produced contrasting results.
“I would say that much [of the restrictions put in place by Denmark] are for nothing. So then you have to ask whether the politicians adopt these kind of regulations and new amendments to respond to the specific needs of the population with regard to something like national security, or whether it’s a kind of rhetoric,” the researcher added.

The organisation cites as a key concern Denmark’s continued commitment to a “highly restrictive migration agenda, adopting nearly 70 legal amendments tightening immigration laws between 2015 and 2018.”
The country’s rate of acceptance of asylum applications has plunged from 85 percent in 2015 to 36 percent in 2017, according to the report.
Minister for immigration Inger Støjberg’s hardline stance on asylum is also noted as a particular concern in the report.
Støjberg has advocated for the detainment of as many rejected asylum seekers as possible, “stretching” to the limit the country’s international obligations, GDP writes.
Meanwhile, there is little access to comprehensive statistics concerning detention in Denmark and the country does not provide data on the annual total number of immigration detainees.
The report also highlights Denmark's previous practice of detaining children in unsuitable facilities, including at Ellebæk and Aabenraa.
“Under (Denmark’s) Aliens Act [udlændingeloven in Danish, ed.] it is actually possible to detain children. They don’t say specifically (that you must not), but they don’t prohibit it either.
“In the case of Denmark, the only provision that is explicitly about children is that they can’t be detained in prison. So by implication they can be detained in dedicated facilities. So it’s a complicated situation,” Majcher said. She noted, however, that sources in Denmark state that children are no longer detained in these facilities.
After a 2014 visit to the immigration centre at Ellebæk, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture said that facility was not a suitable location for holding children.
The committee therefore recommended that the country put an end to the detention of children at Ellebæk altogether, according to GDP’s report.
Denmark’s time limit on immigration detention is also criticised. Danish law provides for an initial period of detention of no more than six months, which can be extended by another 12 months if deportation arrangements take longer, either because the detainee refuses to cooperate in the return process or there are delays in obtaining necessary travel documents.
In 2015, the UN Committee against Torture stated that the 18-month detention limit for asylum seekers was ""excessive.""
According to government sources, the average time a person spent at the Ellebaek facility in 2016 was 29 days, GDP writes.
Facilites such as Ellebæk and Aabenraa prison are used to detain asylum applicants, while others, including the controversial ‘expulsion centres’ at Kærshovedgård and Sjælsmark accommodate those whose applications have been rejected but have not yet left Danish territory, for example due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.

					08:35 CET+01:00				",Emma Anderson ,Denmark sees Ukrainian asylum seeker boom,"Denmark saw a huge spike in Ukrainians applying for asylum in 2014, according to data released by Eurostat last week and analyzed by The Local.
Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 - more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local. “In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
Denmark saw more than a threefold increase in Ukrainians seeking asylum between 2013 and 2014.
According to the Danish Immigration Service, there were 133 Ukrainian asylum applicants in 2014 compared to just 40 in 2013. Eurostat puts the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in Denmark just slightly higher at 135.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.
In Denmark, ten Ukrainian asylum applicants were rejected in their first attempts, and none were accepted in 2014, according to Eurostat data.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
The number of Ukrainian asylum seekers through the first two months of 2015 has dropped significantly in both Denmark and across the EU. Just nine Ukrainians sought asylum in Denmark in January and there were only three last month.
According to Zelvenska, only 125 Ukrainians applied for asylum across Europe in February.
Denmark has seen asylum numbers across the board drop significantly since the implementation of new stricter rules. Just 440 people sought asylum in Denmark in February, the lowest single-month tally since May 2012.
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013."

					11:22 CEST+02:00				",AFP/DPA/The Local,"Failed asylum seekers travelling from Germany pose terror threat, claims Denmark","The Danish government announced on Thursday that it was extending controls at its border with Germany. In a letter to the EU, Copenhagen cited the security risk posed by people fleeing deportation orders south of the border.
“The large number of illegal migrants and rejected asylum seekers who are awaiting deportation in Germany are a real security threat,” the Danish government wrote in a letter to the EU justifying the decision to extend border controls.
There is “a risk that terror groups will take advantage of their precarious situation,” the letter stated.
The Danish government implemented border controls in January 2016 and they have remained in place ever since. The decision overrides the Schengen Agreement of 1995 which abolished internal border controls in an area which currently encompasses 26 European states.
Although extensions to the measure have been granted several times, the border control had been scheduled to expire in November this year. But the government has now confirmed a further extension that will take the controls well into a third year.
Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg wrote in a press statement that, despite the drop in numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Europe in comparison with a peak in late 2015, the borders of Europe’s countries were still under pressure.
“We cannot close our eyes to the serious terror threat against Denmark. The government therefore finds it necessary to maintain border control for now,” she said according to DR.
Germany also announced on Thursday that it was extending border controls on its border with Austria on Thursday.
German interior minister Thomas de Maizière cited a terror threat as the reason for the extension.
“A complete return to a Schengen area without border controls is only possible when an overall positive development allows for it,” he said.
The EU had wanted the border controls to be abolished by the end of the year. But Germany and Denmark are two of five countries seeking to change the rules to allow for border controls to stay in place for up to four years."

Danish police officers were on board the flight on which the incident occurred.
The confidential report on the most recent Danish deportation to Afghanistan on 28th of February this year includes statement from 11 Danish police officials, writes Politiken.
The two men were beaten by the head of Afghan border police on board the aircraft when they refused to disembark after landing in Kabul, says the report.
Danish officers were present during the beating.
A total of 50 Danish officers took part in the deportation of a total of 16 rejected Afghan asylum seekers, which was subject to protests by activists in Denmark.
After landing, 11 of the 16 left the aircraft and a family of three were still sitting in their seats near the front when the two men refused to leave their places, according to the report.
“In this connection, he [the Afghan police officer] made use of force that would not have been deemed justifiable had Danish police acted similarly in the course of their duties in Denmark,” concludes the report.
A Danish police officer who was sitting behind one of the two men said that “four to six powerful blows on the head” were given to him.
Experts told Politiken that the incident is a clear breach of European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) provisions on torture and degrading treatment.
“There is no professional justification for police to use that kind of force,” said Peter Vedel Kessing of the Danish Institute for Human Rights.
There are also descriptions in the report of the two men being hit by fists, a plastic bag containing an unknown item and having their hair pulled by the Afghan police.

The extent of Danish intervention against the Afghan border policeman is not described by the report. Two Danish police officers are reported to have assisted the Afghan officer in placing plastic strip fasteners around the wrists of one of the men.
Both Kessing and Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen of Sweden’s Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights told Politiken that Denmark has jurisdiction on deportation flights, even after landing.
“In the situation described I would support the argument that there is shared jurisdiction. That means that both Danish and Afghan authorities have responsibility for the situation that developed on the plane,” said Gammeltoft-Hansen.
This would mean that Danish police officers in such situations would have to ensure that the refugees are treated in accordance with the ECHR and not handed over to countries where they are at risk of torture or degrading treatment.
“It is valid until the last moment. As long as the deported individuals are on board an aircraft chartered by Danish authorities, Danish police are responsible for assessing whether there are risks of breaching [human rights] in the present case,” Gammeltoft-Hansen told Politiken.
“Of course the deported people can’t just refuse to leave the plane so they are flown back to Denmark, but the reports does not say that any of the Danish officers tried to stop the [Afghan] police chief,” Kessing said.

The lawyer for the two deported Afghan men has contacted the relevant ombudsman, reports Politiken.
In an email to Politiken, immigration minister Inger Støjberg said that proper conditions should be ensured on deportation flights.
“The crucial thing for me is that we deport those that have no right to be in Denmark. I do not wish to talk about this specific case, but I would like to stress that deportations must be done in a proper and decent manner. That is also covered by our arrangements with the countries we deport to,” Støjberg wrote."

The Copenhagen police said they arrested the 30-year-old man jointly with the Danish Security and Intelligence Service on Thursday over a failed attack which he plotted with another 21-year-old man in November 2016.
“The man is charged with attempted terrorism for having, together with another man convicted in Germany, planned to randomly kill or hurt several people in an unknown location in Copenhagen,"" the police said in a statement.
The police added the two men ""wanted to attack people with knives and thereafter detonate one or several explosives, which failed when the accomplice was denied entry into Denmark and arrested by the German police"".
A German court in July convicted the 21-year-old, described as a Syrian refugee by the German media, for attempting an attack. He was reportedly carrying 17,000 matches, two kitchen knives and six walkie-talkies when the German police arrested him.
Earlier this year a would-be female jihadist was sentenced to eight years in jail for a planning to bomb two Danish schools. The Islamic State sympathiser, a Muslim convert, was just 15 years-old when she was arrested in 2016.

Crowds in Aarhus and Copenhagen protested on Friday against the Kærshovedgård deportation centre, demanding its shutdown and the re-opening of cases of rejected asylum seekers.
The Danish government houses rejected asylum seekers at departure or expulsion centers, at the Kærshovedgård centre, which is located in Jutland, as well the Sjælsmark centre in Zealand.
Some rejected asylum seekers who do not willingly leave Denmark are not deported due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.
Some of the Kærshovedgård residents joined the demonstration in Copenhagen, Kaisa Skoluda, coordinator of a solidarity project with rejected asylum seekers in the centres, told The Local.
The demonstrations were a cry for mercy for rejected asylum seekers who ""didn't do anything wrong except for the mistake of seeking asylum in Denmark,"" activist Anemone Samy told The Local.
""Our politicians and our government say that life has to be horrible for these people [so] they [leave], and anybody abroad hears about this will not come to Denmark,"" Samy said.
Martin Lemberg-Pedersen, assistant professor in Global Refugee Studies at Aalborg University's Department of Culture and Global Studies, told The Local in November last year that the circumstances at the centre had been proven by studies to cause psychological illness.
“This is a very serious situation, due in part to the very rationale behind such expulsion centres. They are built on a logic that people can be motivated to leave the country. This means that the centre's main function is to impose living conditions so intolerable that people will leave. Consequently, [the centres] are not created in a way that allows for a normal, healthy life,” Lemberg-Pedersen said.
""What we need to speak about in Denmark also is not just the fact that these camps are here, but the fact that we allow this to exist in a country that we say is a free country,"" Samy told The Local during Friday's protest in Aarhus.
On January 15th, immigration minister Inger Støjberg said to broadcaster DR following a visit to Kærshovedgård Departure Centre that those refused asylum must leave Denmark.
""I can understand wanting to be in Denmark. I'd also much rather be here than in Iraq or Afghanistan. But that makes no difference. If you are not being persecuted, you cannot be in Denmark - so you must leave,"" Støjberg said.
Kærshovedgård, a former prison, was converted into a departure centre in 2016. Its maximum capacity is 600 residents.

Asylum seekers commonly do not tell the truth about their situation when applying o be granted asylum in Denmark.
A newly-released review of 500 asylum applications rejected by the Danish Refugee Appeals Board (Flygningenævnet) shows that over half of these contained partial or complete falsehoods, reports broadcaster TV2.
“Some people have stories that do not have a basis in reality. The explanations just don’t hold up,” Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingeservice) vice director Anders Dorph told TV2.
Of 2,400 asylum applications received during the last three months of 2016, around half were rejected, according to news agency Ritzau. A ‘fair amount’ of these had issues with credibility, Dorph said.
“It’s not unusual that we hear stories about their lives being in danger in the country they come from. That is what this is all about – whether or not someone is persecuted, so it is a very ordinary story,” Dorph told TV2.
But when case officers ask for more detailed information on why the applicant’s life is in danger, and who is endangering them, answers do not add up, he said.
The Danish Immigration Service carries out long interviews with thorough cross examination.

Dorph told TV2 that it was his impression that many asylum seekers follow what they see as as a formula for correct answers when claiming asylum.
“You can say that a pattern emerges,” he said.
The immigration service vice director said that he could not be certain that all false stories had been exposed, and that asylum seekers were given the benefit of the doubt, should any exist.
The primary concern is to ascertain whether an individual is under threat, he said."

					14:11 CET+01:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Danish Social Democrats criticised for plan to 'send asylum seekers to Africa',"Parliamentary allies have responded sceptically to an asylum proposal announced on Monday by the Social Democrats, Denmark's largest opposition party.
According to the proposal, refugees would no longer have the option of claiming asylum 'spontaneously' at Denmark's borders or asylum centres.
Instead, the Social Democrats want to send asylum seekers to a Danish-run facility in an unspecified country in North Africa while their cases are processed.
Parties that would be required to vote through the proposal in parliament, should the Social Democrats win the next general elections, were quick to speak out against the idea.
""Integrating refugees is not without problems. But to imagine you can just wash your hands of the job by giving it to a country in North Africa, I honestly think shows a lack of solidarity,"" said the Red-Green Alliance's Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen to Ritzau.
Although the Social Democrats believe their proposal to meet international rights commitments, Schmidt-Nielsen expressed her doubt over this claim.
""I think the Social Democrats are very much alone in thinking this conforms with human rights,"" she said.
Pia Olsen Dyhr, leader of the Socialist People's Party, said she could see positive elements in the notion.
""In relation to helping refugees in a better and more sustainable way, increasing development aid, resuming acceptance of quota refugees and processing asylum cases in neighbouring countries, this is positive,"" Dyhr told DR.
The Social Liberal (Radikale Venstre) party said that, while it did not oppose accommodating refugees in North Africa in principal, the proposal by the Social Democrats was ""totally unrealistic"".
""We will never find an African country that will take on this task for us,"" leader Morten Østergaard said, calling instead for a ""much more obligating agreement with our neighbouring countries in the EU,"" providing for a more authoritative negotiating position with North African countries.
""It is building a castle in the sand to claim that a new government would be able to do this [without support of other countries]. Neither a new government not the one we have now would be able to,"" Østergaard added.
The environmentalist Alternative party called the proposal unrealistic and inhuman.
""You are proposing transferring the burden to a North African country… leaving the problem for neighbouring countries. And saying 'no' to individuals and displaced people that come here,"" the party's immigration spokesperson Josephine Fock said.
But Alternative praised another element of Monday's Social Democrat proposal, which would raise the amount of aid money paid to developing countries.
""But that is not the same as completely locking everything down here in Denmark,"" Fock said.
The proposal also brought forth reaction on Denmark's right wing.
""I wish we could click our fingers and create such a system. But unfortunately, the situation in many North African countries is so unstable that it would not be possible to build the camps,"" Marcus Knuth, immigration issues spokesperson with the governing Liberal (Venstre) party, said to Ritzau.
""And the countries that are more stable would not in their wildest dreams think about saying yes to this,"" Knuth added.
Martin Henriksen, immigration spokesperson with the anti-immigration Danish People's Party, said the Social Democrats would deserve a ""group hug"" if they were to follow through on the proposal.
Henriksen also suggested that the idea could work within human rights conventions.
""If this proposal is implemented in the right way, it could be done within the various conventions,"" Henriksen told Ritzau.

					09:56 CET+01:00				", The Local,Disappearing cast haunts Danish asylum ballet,"A performance at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre faces an unusual problem: the stars of the show -- sold out in advance -- could face deportation before the final curtain falls.
In ""Uropa -- An asylum-seekers' ballet"", six migrants tell their stories with the help of dancers from the Royal Danish Ballet, hoping to change perceptions of refugees in a country that has recently rolled out some of
Europe's strictest asylum rules.
""The hardest part is, during the rehearsals, to speak about your own issues... without showing any feelings,"" said Salam Susu, a 32-year-old PhD student in musicology from the Syrian city of Homs.
Disco funk music and ballet moves are mixed with harrowing tales of persecution and rape in the performance, which opened just days after Danish lawmakers voted to allow police to confiscate valuables from refugees and
delay family reunifications by three years.
With few props on stage, dialogue and dance are at the centre of the English-language play, which opened on Friday and runs for three weeks.
Although the script involves Susu and her partner, a music teacher, describing how their lives descended into chaos as Syria's civil war escalated, they say rehearsals helped take their minds off the nagging uncertainty that permeates life in an asylum centre.
Three days before the opening of ""Uropa"" -- the title being a play on the Danish words for unrest, ""uro"", and Europe -- they were finally told that their applications for asylum had been accepted.
""It's crazy, I cannot believe that before the premiere we had our asylum,"" Susu laughed.
Others have been less fortunate since an original lineup of 10 were recruited last year: Two cast members have had their asylum applications rejected and one person has gone into hiding.
A fourth asylum seeker, Mahyar Pourhesabi from Iran, was sent to France under the Dublin Convention, which requires asylum seekers to have their requests processed in the first EU country where they arrive.
In a segment of the play he appears to be sitting in an Internet cafe, speaking to the audience via a video link about living on the streets of Paris and sleeping in airports and train stations.
""The asylum system here is not working well at all,"" he says.
Director Christian Lollike said there was no guarantee the remaining cast of six wouldn't be decimated further, but maintained that using real migrants on stage was an essential part of the show.
""The meeting of their 'real' presence and the dancers, these two languages, when they meet that's when something new is happening,"" he said.
Lollike has previously cast maimed Danish war veterans in a ""war ballet"", and he courted controversy in 2012 by staging a play based on the manifesto of Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik.
""I'm hoping that people will have another view on what is an asylum seeker... And I (would) like the refugees to speak for themselves and to tell them how they have experienced coming to Denmark and meeting the Danish system,"" he said.
In one scene the actors echo some of the main arguments used by Danes who want to curb immigration.
""How much tolerance can we afford?"" asks Ali Ishaq, a 45-year-old gay man from Pakistan. ""Shall we tolerate these migrants who prevent their children from going to state schools? Or who force their women to dress or behave in a certain way?"" he says.
The dilemma of socially liberal Denmark admitting migrants with homophobic or misogynist views is all too familiar to Ishaq, who also gives a chilling monologue about being gang-raped in Pakistan following an argument about male chauvinism and Islam.
On stage he talks about a worsening climate for gay people in Pakistan. Off stage, he says he has encountered similarly negative attitudes from the Pakistani community in Denmark.
""I decided to come to Scandinavia for the human rights' sake,"" he said before a rehearsal, wearing a ""Copenhagen Pride"" t-shirt.
But the socially conservative attitudes of some migrants should not be enough to bar them from coming to Denmark, he said.
""They might have a political problem that might kill them in Pakistan,"" he said.
The play could be one of several small steps to change a widespread Danish perception of refugees as ""parasites"", he hoped.
""Politically I think they are tightening up this noose around the whole asylum system,"" he said of the recent moves to deter migrants from coming to the Scandinavian country.
But both Susu and Ishaq said their encounters with Danes had been positive.
""Everybody we've met until now has been friendly,"" said Susu."

The number of people seeking asylum in Denmark doubled in 2014 and Europe as a whole is facing one of the largest influxes of refugees in history, re-igniting the debate over who should be granted asylum and who should not.
For some would-be refugees who make it to Denmark, the criteria for their acceptance is a straight-forward application of Danish laws and international conventions. But many cases go beyond legal criteria and come down to the the stories told by each individual asylum seeker.
The theatre performance collective Paradox Intertainment is putting on a 'documentary theatre production' to shine a spotlight on this dilemma by staging four shows that will give viewers the opportunity to experience the asylum system from the inside out.
In 'Welcome to Denmark', four actual asylum seekers will tell their individual stories and express their reasons for seeking refuge in Denmark. The four cases will be used to put human faces on an asylum debate that has largely turned into discussions about raw numbers and quotas.
After the asylum seekers tell their stories, there will be a dramatic reconstruction of the difficult decisions that the Danish Refugee Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet) has to make when evaluating the merits of each individual case.
""For the refugee board, they have to look at trustworthiness and they only have a little amount of time to hear the story and consider all of the issues,"" Paradox Intertainment spokeswoman Henriette Kudsk told The Local.
""We don’t have a political motive, we just want to show how difficult it is for everybody in this field to decide who will get asylum or not,"" she added.
The productions will begin on May 13th with the story of Asif Danishyar, a former Afghan interpreter for Norwegian forces who has applied for asylum in Denmark. Subsequent productions will revolve around a Ugandan fleeing persecution over sexual orientation, an Iranian seeking asylum on religious grounds and a Syrian who fled that country's long and brutal civil war.
Dates for the four productions are May 13 and 19, June 2 and June 6. All will be held at Politikens Hus at Rådhuspladsen 37 in central Copenhagen and the productions will be a mixture of Danish and English.

Residents also filmed two incidents in which the camp’s staff used physical force against a Syrian asylum seeker, binding his legs and shoving his face into the ground.
A staff member can be heard yelling at the man in Danish: “I won’t have trouble in my camp – do you understand?”
Another clip of the same incident shows the staff members yelling at residents in English to “go away”.
Information reported that the man hired to run the asylum camp was found guilty in 2014 of using violence against residents at a children’ home where he previously worked. He was fired from that job but later hired by Langeland Municipality to run the asylum tent camp, which has space for some 400 asylum seekers.

After the newspaper’s report, the man was immediately put on leave but that did little to dampen the controversy.
Several politicians have vowed to hold Integration Minister Inger Støjberg accountable for the conditions in Danish asylum centres and several experts have called on Denmark to establish a new system for monitoring the centres, saying that current checks from the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen) and the parliamentary ombudsman are not up to the task.
“With so many new centres it’s obvious that things will happen and that you risk hiring people who don’t know what they should do or don’t understand their role. Therefore, the [annual] inspections from the ombudsman are not enough,” Eva Singer, the head of asylum at the Danish Refugee Council, told Information.
Langeland Municipality said it was considering implementing an immediate change to hiring practices following the report.
“When we hire new employees, we get a børneattest [a ‘childhood certificate' that includes information on any previous convictions for sexual assault, child pornography or incest, ed.] but we don’t ask to see their criminal records. That hasn’t been standard procedure but it could very well be that this [incident] gives rise to making it a part of procedure,” spokeswoman Sisi Eibye told news agency Ritzau."

“In recent days there has been a relatively large focus on the asylum camp in Næstved. When so many people are gathered in one place, it is hard to avoid friction. But the 34-year-old has gone significantly over the line in terms of what we can accept and he must now of course face the consequences of his actions,” police inspector Kim Kliver said in a press release.
South Zealand Police confirmed to TV2 that the man in question is the asylum seeker shown in videos released by Information newspaper being restrained by staff at the refugee tent camp. Those videos and reports of physical and emotional abuse led to the camp’s leader, Kent Nielsen, being fired from his position.

But Radio24syv reported on Tuesday that the 34-year-old asylum seeker has a history of abusive behaviour and aimed a series of threats at the fired Nielsen, other personnel and fellow residents of the camp.
According to documents obtained by the radio station, the man was brought to the tent camp in Næstved after officials at a Red Cross centre determined that he was a potential danger to both women and children. After arriving at the tent camp, the Syrian was involved in a number of incidents in which he threatened and/or verbally abused residents and staff.
Jan Olsen, a Danish Emergency Management Agency (Bered­skabs­sty­rel­sen) employee responsible for delivering food to the camp, told Radio24syv that the man “is a person who could create a civil war with just two people”.
“Even toward my kitchen staff, he was a very brash and provocative type who constantly seeks conflict and discord. He has expressed himself sexually toward the female [staff members] and would stand at the fence and yell at them when they went home at night,” Olsen said.
“He seeks out conflict from morning to night,” he added.
Radio24syv reported that prior to the incident that was caught on camera, the 34-year-old man had threatened to kill the now fired camp leader before attempting to break a window with the apparent intention of using a glass shard to attack the employee.
Nielsen told Radio24syv that he could not comment in detail to a confidentiality clause, but confirmed that the asylum seeker in question had threatened to kill him.
“He threatened my life and tried to hit me, upon which I attempted to pacify him by twisting his arm. However, he was acting out and was very aggressive so we put him in a leg lock. I don’t believe that I used too much force, but rather the amount of force that was necessary,” he said.
In addition to facing charges for threatening staff and residents, the 34-year-old Syrian is also being charged with violence for pushing a cameraman."

Three new tent camps, of the same type as the one currently housing 250 asylum centres in Thisted, will be located in Næstved, Herning and Haderslev, according to a ministry statement released on Tuesday.
The ministry also announced plans to build a new ‘departure centre’ near Ikast, in which temporary accommodation will be provided for up to 600 rejected asylum applicants as well as those granted asylum but later deported due criminal convictions.
“I believe that we have found a good solution for a pressing problem. Those persons who do not have the right to asylum can be placed in secured accommodation, from where they can be deported as quickly as possible,” Integration Minister Inge Støjberg said in a statement.
“It also sends a clear message to criminals and otherwise ejected persons that the government does not want them in Denmark,” she added.
In addition to the tents and departure centre, a number of shed-like structures in a so-called ‘barracks’ will be built at the new facilities in Herning and Haderslev in order to house families. This represents the first time families will not be accommodated in normal buildings.
Family reunification wait affects only few
In other asylum news, Politiken newspaper reported on Wednesday that despite the government's plan to increase the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years, the effort would, in fact, only apply to around 20 percent of reunification applicants.
While the government is able to enforce the prolonged waiting time on normal asylum seekers – for example those claiming asylum on the basis of the dangers of civil war in their homeland – many Syrian asylum seekers qualify for the international ‘convention status’. This means they are able to cite further threats to their wellbeing, specifically being called up for military service.
The government is unable to apply its reunification rules to refugees with convention, rather than normal asylum, status.
According to records since February this year – when restrictions put into place by the previous government began to differentiate the two statuses – only 809 of 3,831 asylum applications did not qualify for convention status.
Both the government and the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) have expressed disappointment with the apparent limitations of the recent tightening of family reunification rules.
“We would like the restrictions to also apply to convention refugees,” DF spokesperson Martin Henriksen told Politiken.
“This is not because it is our wish,” said Morten Knuth of the governing Venstre party. “We are bound by the conventions. We are of the opinion that we will do everything we can [to tighten the rules] while remaining within the limits of the conventions.”"

The recently-formed Venstre government announced on Wednesday that unemployment welfare benefits that asylum seekers coming to Denmark were entitled to under the previous government will be replaced by a new – and significantly lower – so-called ‘integration benefit’.
“The government will, as promised during the election, quickly implement a new integration benefit for new arrivals, in order to make Denmark a less attractive destination while making it more attractive to work and contribute to Danish society,” a press release from the Ministry of Employment stated.

The legislation is expected to be passed on Friday, with support from the Danish People’s Party, Liberal Alliance, and Conservatives and the changes are expected to go into effect in September.
During the recent election, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen frequently noted that he intended to introduce changes that would help reduce the number of refugees coming to Denmark.
“We want to get a grip on the immigration policy so that the influx of asylum seekers and people coming here through family reunification is brought under control,” the PM told journalists at a press conference in June.

The new restrictions will initially only apply to refugees arriving after September, but will from January 2016 be expanded to include all foreigners who have not resided in Denmark for seven out of the past eight years. The restrictions will also reportedly apply to Danish citizens who haven't lived in the country for seven of the past eight years.
The integration benefit will be lowered to the level of Danish student grants, meaning that a single adult with no children will receive 5,945 kroner per month before tax, compared to the current 10,849 kroner unemployment benefit – a 45 percent cut.
Foreigners will also receive a financial incentive to learn Danish, as those who pass the intermediate Danish language exam will receive a 1,500 kroner increase to their monthly integration benefit.

The Danish Refugee Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet) on Monday morning said it would review the woman's case, a process her lawyer Jytte Lindgaard said would take at least three months.
Lindgaard declined to comment on the decision.
“But I can say generally that the risk that something happens to her is much too great,” she told Denmark’s Ritzau news agency. “She has among other things given lectures on what it is like to be a lesbian asylum seeker.”
Denmark's decision last month to deny asylum to three Ugandan lesbians was harshly criticised by the campaign group LGBT Asylum, which fights for the rights of gays, lesbians and transsexual people within the Danish asylum system.
“We are very relieved!” the organisation posted on Facebook on Saturday. “But we can not relax completely. First, we must now work to ensure that she actually does receive asylum when her case be re-examined, and secondly there are still two rejected people in Ellebæk jail awaiting deportation.”
Asylum campaigners from the group Welcome to Denmark mounted a demonstration on Monday at Copenhagen Airport in support of the woman, with more than 20 protestors linking arms in front of the check-in at Terminal 2.
Being gay or lesbian has been illegal in Uganda since 1952, when the colonial government brought in a series of anti-gay laws.
In 2013, Uganda's parliament debated a controversial law that made homosexual acts punishable by death, although by the time it was enacted the penalty had been softened to life imprisonment.
The law was annulled by the country's Constitutional Court in August 2014, but gay Ugandans still face long prison sentences if caught by the police.
Hanne Gyberg from LGBT Asylum told Ritzau last month that this was far from the worst risk faced by homosexual men and women in the country.
“Homosexuals risk persecution from other civilians, their families and clan members as well as blackmail and assault,” she said. “Homosexuals cannot expect police protection if they are attacked, threatened or killed.”"

In a press release, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said that future arriving couples in which at least one of the people involved is under 18 will not be allowed to live together in Denmark. Likewise, underage married asylum seekers already in the country will be separated.
“It is completely unacceptable that there are currently minors within the Danish asylum system living with their spouses or partners and I have asked the Danish Immigration Service to immediately put a stop to it,” Støjberg said.
“We should naturally ensure that young girls are not being forced to live in a relationship with an adult at the asylum centres,” she added.
Last month, the Integration Ministry obtained an overview of the Danish asylum system that revealed that there are currently 27 minors who have spouses or partners. According to a Wednesday report in Metroxpress, there are two married 14-year-old girls at Danish asylum centres. One is married to a 28-year-old man, while the other is pregnant and has a 24-year-old husband.
Metroxpress reported that a political majority within parliament supports denying asylum to men who have so-called ‘child brides’.
“It’s called paedophilia when a man gets a 14-year-old pregnant. We can give asylum to the 14-year-old but we should kick the grown man out,” Conservative spokesman Naser Khader told the newspaper.
The ministry press release said that all asylum seekers under 15 would be separated from their adult spouses or partners, while immigration officials would evaluate the cases of those aged 15 and above individually.

Robel Kidane had meant to travel between Vellinge and Osby in southern Sweden but got on the wrong train and wound up in Denmark. When he and Red Cross worker Mikael Kinning contacted authorities for help he was instead removed from the asylum register and told he would have to reapply for asylum if he managed to return.
The pair initially did not know how they would get the boy back across the bridge to Sweden, where police border and ID checks have been in place for around ten months. But when Kinning visited Kidane at his temporary asylum youth home in Denmark to go out for pizza together in Odense on Thursday he decided to take his chances.
“When we were in the car I asked Robel if he wanted to have pizza in Sweden instead. He did,” Kinning, who works with the Red Cross in Vellinge, told the Sydsvenskan newspaper which first broke the story.
“We work with these guys and you can say that they get under our skin. And when you see what happens to them and they get stuck in Denmark unintentionally you have to act in some way. You have to test the system and see if it works,” said Kinning.
When they reached the police border control, Kinning showed his own ID and a copy of Kidane's ID for asylum seekers in Sweden and was let through.
“We've taken the first step now. He's back in Vellinge. He's going to stay here. This is where he goes to school, this is where he has his friends,” he said.
Kinning will now try to get Kidane's asylum application case file reopened. If not, he will have to reapply for asylum under Sweden's tough new rules which mean he will no longer be able to apply for permanent residency and can hope for a temporary permit at best.
But despite his uncertain future, Kidane said he was happy to be back in Sweden, where he has lived since August last year.
“It is great. I am very happy. Three weeks is a lot. In Denmark I was angry, very angry. In Sweden everything feels good,” he told Sydsvenskan."

					09:55 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Asylum rules hit Danish pre-election talks ,"Immigration and asylum issues feature high on the agenda in the upcoming Danish parliamentary elections.
Two of Denmark’s major political parties, the Social Democrats and the Danish People’s Party, have started a pre-election race, competing to be the party with the toughest stance on immigration and asylum issues.
Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (Social Democrats) is bound by law to call for an election to be held by September 15th at the latest, but speculation is widespread that she might call an early election.
After years of political wrestling over unemployment and the economy, the re-emergence of value-politics such as immigration may be a sign that the Danish electorate have finally left the financial crisis behind and shifted their attention to softer issues.
Everyone should contribute
At the end of March, the incumbent Social Democrats launched a campaign in which it called for stricter regulations for immigrants and asylum seekers. The campaign was launched just after a larger integration package.
Large posters of a smiling Thorning-Schmidt addressing all newcomers with the words: “If you come to Denmark, you should work” have been pasted along bike lanes and on buses all over the Copenhagen-area. Analysts say this message is in line with the party’s traditional ethos of everyone contributing to the society to the best of his or her abilities before claiming any entitlements.
Unhappy about copies
But the Danish People’s Party is not happy about the campaign, claiming that the Social Democrats have stolen its core political message in order to attract votes. Member of Parliament for The Danish People’s Party, Søren Espersen, said on the Danmarks Radio (DR) programme “Deadline” that he hoped the Danish voters would recognize it was a copy and differentiate it from the original.
A hard-line party on immigration and asylum rules since its inception, the Danish People’s Party has now hit back with a proposal that asylum seekers in Denmark should only be granted family reunion once they have been granted permanent residency in Denmark. This typically takes around five years, according to DR.
But human rights experts have warned that this would violate international human rights.
“I have problems seeing how that [proposal] would survive a human rights evaluation,” head of the Danish Institute for Human Rights, Jonas Christoffersen, told DR.
Fewer asylum seekers in 2015
In 2014 Denmark received some 14,800 asylum seekers, according to DR. This is far fewer than Sweden, however, which in 2014 received more than 80,000 asylum seekers, the second-highest number since the Second World War.
The tightening of the Danish asylum regulations seems to have had an effect already, however. In February, Denmark received some 440 asylum seekers, down from 637 in January, DR said. This is the lowest number for a single month since May 2012.
Part II: The economy
Separately, the Social Democrats just before Easter launched the second part of its election campaign, focusing on the economy. The key message is: “Things are getting better in Denmark,” referring to more jobs, shorter waiting lists in hospitals and an improved economy."

Ib Lauritsen, mayor in Ikast-Brande, and Morten Slotved of Hørsholm have both said that they would like to see asylum facilities in their jurisdictions closed.
The facilities in question are Denmark’s two so-called udrejsecenters (departure or expulsion centres), which house rejected asylum seekers who have not yet left Danish territory, for example due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.
Expulsion centres are located at Kærshovedgård and Sjælsmark, within the Ikast-Brande and Hørsholm municipalities respectively.
Lauritsen told newspaper Kristeligt Dagblad that he would like the Kærshovedgård facility to close.
“If I am to be honest, we never wanted the centre. So if it was announced that the centre was to close, we would welcome that. I would actually prefer the centre not to be there,” Lauritsen told the newspaper.
The Local has previously reported on the conditions at Kærshovedgård and has visited the facility to speak to people accommodated there.
Lauritsen said that the primary reason for his stance was the negative feeling towards the centre in Bording, the nearest town, and amongst others that live close to Kærshovedgård.
Some residents have put up fences and others have expressed concerns about having asylum seekers accommodated in the area, he said.
“I understand people that feel sorry for them and want to help. But I also understand neighbours who don’t want them there. It’s not a black-and-white situation. It’s complex, and it’s difficult to accommodate everyone in a small community,” Lauritsen, who represents the Liberal (Venstre) party – that of Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and immigration minister Inger Støjberg – told Kristeligt Dagblad.

Slotved, the Conservative mayor in Hørsholm, cited security issues in his calls for the Sjælsmark centre to be closed.
Internal conflicts and situation involving a hostage inside the facility are amongst those causing concern for residents, according to Kristeligt Dagblad's report.
“This is a big issue for us and it is more than our local community can cope with. So we are campaigning hard for it to be closed,” Slotved told the newspaper.

The reported concerns of local residents fit with a recognisable trend, according to Jens Peter Frølund Thomsen, a researcher at Aarhus University.
“When you have an asylum centre nearby, the problems just become more real,” Thomsen said to Kristeligt Dagblad.
Similar responses of small local communities to an influx of asylum seekers have been observed in other European countries including Greece and Italy, he said.
“What is interesting is that capital cities find it easier to accept the problems that can arise with other cultures and subcultures, while smaller local communities react quite negatively,” the researcher continued.
Pia Heike Johansen, a professor at the University of Southern Denmark and researcher into urban-rural relations and immigration, said that the injection of new residents to a local community is often an economic boon, but that context was important.
“(Immigration) brings more children to schools, more members in local societies and more customers to local shops,” Johansen said to Kristeligt Dagblad.
Problems arise when asylum seekers or foreign workers are introduced to a local community on a short-term basis, she added.
“There is simply lower tolerance if the foreigners do not stay there. Networks and relationships are not developed. If people are only there for six months and then move on, or are at a departure centre for an unspecified period, the tolerance threshold is completely different,” Johansen said.

Radio 24syv obtained the police report that Langeland Municipality delivered to Funen Police in June. In it, municipal officials say that they suspect the female employee of having sexual relationships with three boys at the centre.

The Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) last week announced its decision to shut down Børnecenter Tullebølle after being informed that two female employees of the centre are suspected of having sexually violated one or more boys under the age of 18.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told broadcaster DR that the two women in question were removed from their posts and that Funen Police will now investigate the sexual assault claims.
On Monday, police would neither confirm nor deny the new revelations.
“But it is clear that we are taking this case very seriously. When one’s role is to protect vulnerable children, this is a very serious allegation,” spokesman Sten Skovgaard Larsen told Radio 24syv.
Documents obtained by the radio station showed that although the sex abuse claims were first reported to DIS and the public last week, at least three high-placed municipal employees were aware of the situation as far back as June 10th.
Langeland Mayor Bjarne Nielsen was reportedly not informed about the sex case and said that he will now speak with other municipal leaders to find out who knew what and when they knew it.
The sex abuse allegations are the latest in a series of problems at the centre, which houses roughly 40 underage boys.
Last month, the centre’s residents were involved in a mass brawl. No one was seriously injured but an employee of the centre was struck by a 15-year-old boy with a metal pipe.
In August, five teenage boys from the centre were charged for sexual assaults committed during the Langelandsfestival. Three were charged with groping, and two for raping a 16-year-old girl.
The month prior, boys from the centre took part in a fight involving upwards of 100 minor asylum seekers during a football match against residents of another asylum centre."

Located near the town of Ikast, Kærshovedgård is one of Denmark’s two ‘departure centres’ (the term ‘expulsion’ is also commonly used, particularly by critics). Around 200 rejected asylum seekers are accommodated at the facility until they decide to leave.
One of the residents of Kærshovedgård, Jamiar, was waiting for us a few meters outside the gate. The security guards checked our IDs and let us in as Jamiar’s visitors. As we walked by, a few people stood around the old buildings of the facility watching us. Jamiar pointed at the buildings to our left.
Surrounded by fences within Kærshovedgård’s own periphery, “this is where people who committed crimes are kept,” he said.
Jamiar told us that Kærshovedgård’s residents go to court when they commit crimes such as stealing food or not reporting their presence in the camp when they are required to.
The residents of Kærshovedgård are adult men and women who have been permanently refused asylum and whose departure deadline has been exceeded, according to a Ministry of Immigration report.
There are different categories for residency in Kærshovedgård. Women and men live in separate buildings, while individuals who have been convicted of crimes stay in separately in buildings surrounded by more fences and surveillance cameras.
We walked a little further, to where Jamiar lives, on the second floor of one of the more modern, grey buildings. The narrow hallway has doors to more than a dozen rooms, one bathroom and one laundry room. “Please take off your shoes,” the sign on Jamiar’s door read.

The moment we walked in the room, we could smell the Persian spices Jamiar and his roommate keep. Although they are not allowed to cook inside the camp, Jamiar explained he obtained a small stove because he could not eat the food served in the cafeteria.
“The police say we cannot make food here. We can only eat in the cafeteria and it is only Danish food. I respect Denmark but I cannot eat Danish food,” he said.
Jamiar set up the floor for us to eat the Iranian lunch he had prepared for his guests, and his roommate.
“Thank you for coming, we are happy to welcome people, now we have friends from everywhere,” he said.
The Iranian and his neighbours are used to hosting friends and volunteers from different initiatives and NGOs including the Red Cross, which has a building inside the camp where residents can read donated books and clothes and socialise with each other.

One initiative, the Solidarity Project, arranges visits to Kærshovedgård, as well as trips for asylum seekers to other cities in Denmark.
“Our aim is to spend time with them and be friends with them, so we buy food sometimes and invite them to other cities to do workshops,” Kasia Sklouda, a participant in the project, told The Local.
While eating lunch, Hojat, who lives on a different floor of Jamiat’s building, joined us. Our conversation was a mix of English, Danish, Arabic and Persian.
Both men say they fled Iran on an 18-day journey to Denmark, escaping political oppression for joining opposition movements. They say that returning to Iran is not option for them.
“When I went to court, my lawyer told me if you stay one year I can [re-]open your case. But I stayed one year and it didn’t open. But I hope that in a few months I will be able to open it again,” Hojat said about his status.
Jamiar lived in a refugee camp in Aalborg before coming to Kærshovedgård. He said the Aalborg facility had better living conditions.
“Here, we have fences all around us,” he said.
“It is right, we are living here behind fences. But we are not criminals. We are good for Denmark,” Hojat said.
Jamiar, who was a hairdresser in Iran, occasionally cuts neighbours’ hair in Kærshovedgård.
“After I go out, I want to study to become a psychiatrist, I already have a diploma in humanities from Iran,” he said.

When I asked them how they spent their time in Kærshovedgård, Hojat said he played football with his friends and attended English classes in the camp from Monday to Friday, while Jamiar attended both English and Danish language classes.
“When we go outside we have to sign to report our attendance three days a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday,” he said, “If I stay outside the whole month they would take out my stuff from my room and send me to court, then to prison.”
After lunch, we met the only Dane we saw at Kærshovedgård, Annette.
Annette was celebrating her boyfriend’s birthday with their baby son and her 9-year-old daughter in a room her boyfriend shares with another man. We sat on a Persian rug on the floor while Anette gave us cake and told us it is the second birthday they have celebrate in the room.
“I have gotten used to it somehow,” Annette said, “I think that once you want to follow your heart, you don’t think about all this trouble.”
“We used to visit each other a lot, now it is less because he got caught.
“They make them pay a fine but they can’t pay it because they don’t have money. We just stopped caring about the rules,” Annette said.
It is common for residents of Kærshovedgård to miss their mandatory registrations. In March, a report showed that registrations have been missed 10,057 times since 2016.
“One of the [men] who lives here is married to a Danish woman and they have a child but it doesn’t change anything,” Annette said. “It is just a whole life of waiting”.

Martin Lemberg-Pedersen, assistant professor in Global Refugee Studies at Aalborg University's Department of Culture and Global Studies, told The Local in October last year that camps like Kærshovedgård are designed to psychologically coerce people to leave Denmark.
“This is a very serious situation, due in part to the very rationale behind such expulsion centres. They are built on a logic that people can be motivated to leave the country. This means that the centre's main function is to impose living conditions so intolerable that people will leave. Consequently, [the centres] are not created in a way that allows for a normal, healthy life,” Lemberg-Pedersen said.

As a result of the living conditions in Kærshovedgård, asylum seekers sometimes get in trouble, which the residents of Ikast can perceive as dangerous.
“Most of the people who live in this area they don’t like [the camp], because here when they don’t get money some of them would go out and steal or make troubles,” Annette said.
“So people who live around here get scared, and everyone you talk to around this place says (they) don’t like (it being) here because it is criminals who live here.”
In a report published by NGO Refugees Welcome Denmark, Michala Clante Bendixen, who heads the organisation, writes:
“In Danish prisons, an effort is made to maintain the inmates’ skills and sense of human worth, while also focusing on preparing them for life once they are released. As an inmate, you are invited to take part in activities all the time – it is the act of detention, which is the punishment. Now, they are working with asylum seekers, who have never done anything illegal – and yet the staff’s task is to make their lives as empty and unbearable as possible.”
Regardless of the conditions, Jamiar and Hojat still have hope that their cases can be reopened and that they will eventually leave Kærshovedgård.
“When I am an old man I will tell my children I was living behind the fences, but I was fighting for freedom,” Hojat said, “just staying here is fighting for freedom.”
Jamiar, Hojat and Annette requested their full names not be published.

					11:49 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Asylum and integration take election spotlight,"With more than a week to go until Danes go to the polls, the election campaign is focusing more and more on immigration and asylum.
Leading opposition party Venstre on Tuesday announced plans to put an “immediate halt” to the “massive influx” of asylum seekers coming to Denmark if his blue bloc is victorious in the June 18th election.
Party leader and former PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen presented Venstre’s proposed asylum reform and vowed to call parliament into an emergency summer session to address Denmark’s refugee policies.
“We cannot sit and wait until October because we know that it is in the summer months that the pressure is the greatest,” Rasmussen said at a press conference.
“In recent years we have been challenged by a nearly explosive influx of asylum seekers. It is the largest in 15 years and nothing points toward it tapering off,” the Venstre leader said.
Denmark saw its asylum seeker numbers double in 2014 compared to the year before, leading the government to tighten its immigration laws by introducing a temporary, one-year residence permit for asylum seekers fleeing civil wars such as the Syrian conflict. Refugees have also been limited in their ability to bring family members to Denmark.
Rasmussen announced an eight-point plan that includes decreasing the amount of financial support that refugees receive from the state, refusing to give permanent residence to refugees unless they are employed and can speak Danish and a reevaluation of Denmark’s international obligations when it comes to refugees.
Rasmussen said that his party’s plan would make Denmark a less attractive destination for asylum seekers, thus cutting the number of people who seek refuge in the country.
“There is no doubt that this tightening of conditions will give rise to fewer asylum seekers,” he said.
""Not a good day""
Andreas Kamm, the general secretary for the Danish Refugee Council, bemoaned the signals that Venstre's proposal sends to refugees already in Denmark.
""The election rhetoric is not helpful for integration or for people's sense of self-worth in Denmark. It is hard to feel welcome here when one listens to what is said in the election campaign,"" Kamm told Politiken.
""I am saddened that the focus has gone from providing persecuted people protection in Europe and Denmark to trying to avoid that that protection happens here. It is a frustrating development in every way,"" he added.
United front among opposition
On Wednesday, Venstre was joined by fellow opposition parties the Conservatives, Danish People’s Party and Liberal Alliance in a joint advertising campaign saying that Denmark’s “foreigner policy needs to get back on track”. The parties pledged lower social benefits for foreigners, tougher deportation rules, increased Danish language requirements, denial of citizenship to “suspected terrorists” and redirecting Denmark’s asylum policies to focus on helping refugees in their local communities rather than accepting them in Denmark.

Rasmussen has focused a great deal of his efforts on the contention that the number of asylum seekers coming to Denmark has grown under Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, saying that Denmark went from tenth to fifth among EU countries in accepting refugees.
Critics have pounced on those claims, pointing out that under his tenure as PM, Denmark was also as high as number five compared to other European countries and that the increase in asylum seekers in Denmark mirrors the trend seen across Europe.
“Venstre should stop trying to make Danes believe that there would have come fewer refugees to Denmark if they had been in power,” PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt has said.
Although Thorning-Schmidt rejected Venstre’s Tuesday proposal, she pledged to sit down with the party after the election “and create a framework for how we can accept these refugees,” she told Politiken.
A competition over the toughest rules
The PM has repeatedly touted the fact that her government has implemented tighter asylum rules, saying that it is the first time in 12 years that Denmark has made it more difficult to get refugee status in Denmark.
With both prime minister candidates expressing a desire to limit the number of refugees in Denmark, MP Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the left-wing Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) accused them of competing to see “who can make life hardest for people on the run”.
“Venstre and the Social Democrats have simply initiated a competition. They compete to see who can make the toughest rules. Thorning brags about removing the right of children to join the parents in safety here in Denmark,” Schmidt-Nielsen wrote on Facebook, referring to the government’s decision to restrict family reunification for refugees.
“Regardless of whether it is Thorning or Løkke who becomes prime minister, refugees will come. And they both know that. We should use our energies to discuss how to create much better integration,” she added."

The number of people applying for asylum in Denmark has plunged after the country tightened its immigration laws last year to stem the influx of Syrian refugees, data released Wednesday showed. In January, 626 people -- around half of them from Syria -- applied for asylum compared with 3,150 in September, according to the Danish Immigration Service. The government said in September it would introduce a temporary, one-year residence permit for asylum seekers fleeing civil wars such as the Syrian conflict. The new permit, which came into force this year, can be extended for another two years and does not allow family reunifications to be granted during the first year. See also: UN wants Denmark to drop refugee restrictions Denmark also introduced measures to make it harder for asylum seekers from Eritrea to come to Denmark. Due to those efforts, just three Eritreans sought asylum in Denmark in January, down from a peak of 510 in July. The restrictions on Eritreans were brought about as a result of a highly-controversial 'fact-finding report' that was roundly criticized by the report's one named source and other experts on Eritrea. ""I think one of the most crucial factors for how many people apply is the length of the asylum and the conditions for family reunification,"" the ruling Social Democratic party's spokesman on integration issues, Ole Hækkerup, told Ritzau. ""This is where the government has made an effort.""
Denmark already had some of Europe's toughest immigration laws after governments between 2001 and 2011 relied on the support of the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party in parliament, in exchange for which the party was allowed to help shape migration policies. The number of asylum applications also fell in neighbouring Sweden in January but by a much smaller percentage, down to 4,894 from 9,976 in September, according to the Swedish Migration Board. Sweden became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees and has since seen asylum requests rise to record levels, expected to reach about 90,000 in 2015. The country receives the highest number of refugees per capita in the EU and is second only to Germany as a destination for Syrians fleeing the Middle Eastern country's civil war. The number of migrants entering the EU nearly tripled in 2014 to 280,000 from to just over 100,000 the previous year, mainly due to the conflict in Syria, the bloc's border agency said on Wednesday."

Opposition party Venstre says that the large influx of asylum seekers streaming into the country – primarily from war-torn Syria – have conditions that are too generous. The party has vowed to make Denmark a less attractive destination if it wins back power at the next election. “The majority of asylum seekers have paid large sums to human traffickers who keep an eye on where asylum seekers are given the best living conditions. We want to change the conditions in Denmark so that it become less attractive to come here,” Venstre spokesman Karsten Lauritzen told Jyllands-Posten. Among Venstre’s proposals are banning refugees from working and only allowing them to eat at asylum centres rather than giving them money for food. The party also wants to see those whose asylum applications are rejected leave the country sooner. Fellow opposition parties the Conservatives and the Danish People’s Party told Jyllands-Posten that they supported Venstre’s plans, while libertarian opposition party Liberal Alliance said that it would prefer to make it harder to get refugee status in the first place. Andreas Kamm, the secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council (Dansk Flygtningehjælp), said he didn’t think worsening refugees’ conditions would have an influence on how many come to Denmark. “Asylum seekers are first and foremost fleeing from something and are to a less degree seeking out a particular country,” Kamm told Jyllands-Posten.
Denmark accepted nearly 4,000 refugees in 2013, nearly a third of which came from Syria. In relation to total population, Denmark accepted the fourth highest number of refugees among EU countries. From 2011 to 2013, there was a 98 percent increase in asylum applications. Just this week, local politicians in Rønne on the island of Bornholm and the Jutland town of Sønderborg agreed to take in hundreds of refugees. In Rønne, at least 300 asylum seekers will be placed in a former care centre, while former military barracks in Sønderborg will house around 300 Syrians. In Helsingør, politicians are considering the Danish Immigration Service’s (Udlændingestyrelsen) request to put asylum seekers in Helsingør Hospital, which closed on February 1st."

The man, who was arrested in December, was on Monday informed that he will be remanded in custody until July 9th, police prosecutor Sonja Hedegaard confirmed.
The decision to extend the 31-year-old’s preliminary detention was made behind closed doors at Copenhagen City Court on Monday. Hedegaard declined to give further details.
The man denies the charges.
Police believe the man, who is an asylum seeker in Sweden, was in contact with a 21-year-old Syrian who was sentenced to six years in prison in Germany in July 2017.
The two are believed to have planned to carry out random knife attacks on people in Copenhagen before detonating one or more bombs.
But the attack was prevented when the 21-year-old was stopped while trying to cross the border between Denmark and Germany, Ritzau reports.
He is reported to have been carrying 17,000 matches, fireworks, batteries, six walkie-talkies and kitchen knives.
Hedegaard said she could not confirm whether the police prosecution service would raise charges against the 31-year-old.

Figures released by the Integration Ministry on Monday showed the lowest the lowest number of registered asylum seekers in the ten weeks since Denmark started performing checks at the German border.
In the first week after border checks were put in place, there were 640 asylum seekers. That number hovered between 200 and 300 per week throughout most of January and February but had been below 200 for the past three weeks before plunging further to 80 last week.
On three days last week – Wednesday, Friday and Sunday – the number of asylum seekers was in the single digits, culminating with just five people on Sunday.
Denmark has extended its border checks four times since their introduction on January 4th. The most recent extension will keep the controls in place until at least April 3rd.
The Danish government has said that border controls will remain necessary as long as Sweden continues its ID checks, which have also been extended numerous times.
“While the Swedish border is de facto closed for asylum seekers without correct papers, there is a risk of large groups of refugees and migrants being stranded here in Denmark when they find themselves unable to travel onwards to Sweden,” Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said earlier this month.
Denmark, which has half the population of Sweden, received 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, a rise of 44 percent from the previous year. Sweden, meanwhile received 163,000 asylum applications last year, but has also seen the number of migrant arrivals fall sharply since introducing its border measures."

The number of refugees seeking asylum in Denmark nearly doubled in 2014, newly-released figures from the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) show. A total of 14,815 people sought asylum in 2014. Although the final number ended up significantly below the government’s estimate of 20,000, it is still nearly double the number from 2013, when 7,557 asylum seekers made their way to Denmark. The 2014 numbers represent a nearly fourfold increase over 2009, when just 3,855 asylum seekers came to the country. Nearly half of all the asylum seekers in 2014 came from war-torn Syria. The 7,185 Syrians who sought asylum in Denmark were more than three times larger than the next biggest group: 2,293 Eritreans. The number of refugees seeking and receiving asylum in Denmark was a dominant topic among the nation’s politicians and media throughout much of 2014. In September, the government announced that it would introduce a new, temporary type of residence permit for asylum seekers fleeing civil wars such as the Syrian conflict after a huge surge in the number of applications. Two weeks later, that was followed by the introduction of new restrictions on the ability of refugees to have their family members join them in Denmark. Those restrictions were criticised by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and a long line of human rights organisations. Denmark also controversially announced that it would tighten restrictions on Eritrean asylum seekers. After the number of Eritrean refugees spiked over the summer, the justice minister called on DIS to carry out a ‘fact-finding’ mission, the results of which were so heavily criticised that the government ultimately had to admit that it had “doubts” about the report and that Eritreans can expect to be ""granted asylum in many cases"". While the government was making it more difficult for refugees to get asylum in Denmark, opposition parties wanted to go even further, suggesting that asylum seekers should receive worse conditions or simply be sent back to where they came from. All of the asylum talk seemed to have a negative impact on the Danish people. One poll from December showed that 44 percent of Danes are sometimes “ashamed” by the national debate on immigration and foreigners while another showed that 51 percent of Danes think that the debate over asylum seekers has gone too far. Denmark’s integration minister, Manu Sareen, said the results of the polls should serve as a wake-up call. “We – especially those of us here in Christiansborg – should sometimes stop and think about how we talk about people. Words create realities and that means that we as politicians have a responsibility,” Sareen told Berlingske at the time. Of the 14,815 refugees who sought asylum in Denmark last year, 6,110 of them were granted refugee status. That 41 percent approval rate was lower than the 51 percent who were granted asylum in 2013. Denmark’s costs for housing refugees in 2014 is expected to be 9.2 billion kroner ($1.4 billion), a near doubling of the 4.7 billion kroner asylum costs in 2013."

A long line of Norwegian politicians distanced themselves from Denmark’s controversial bill allowing for the confiscation of cash and valuables from migrants, but Norway’s rules on how much an asylum seeker can bring in to the country are actually stricter, broadcaster NRK reported.
Denmark on Tuesday approved a sweeping immigration bill that among other things gives authorities the ability to confiscate cash and valuables worth more than 10,000 Danish kroner (around 12,500 Norwegian kroner).
See also: PM: Norway will not seize valuables from migrants
The Danish government has said that the cash and valuables will be used to offset asylum seekers’ stay in the country and use of social services.
The regulations of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI), however, state that asylum seekers who enter the country with more than 5,000 kroner risk losing access to social benefits.
In contrast to Denmark, Norway’s rules do not allow the police to confiscate any cash or valuables.
Still the lower monetary limit has led some to accuse Norwegian politicians of hypocrisy for joining in the international chorus of critics of the Danish law.
“If you just look at the value limit, the Norwegian rules are without a doubt more strict than the Danish law,” lawyer Cecile Schjatvet told NRK.
Christian Democrats spokeswoman Dagrun Eriksen said that few Norwegian politicians were aware of the rule. Now that it’s come to her attention, she said the value limit should be raised.
“I want to change the current rules in Norway. Five thousand kroner is too low. Even though the authorities don’t confiscate valuables worth more than 5,000 kroner, that isn’t the same as having a ban against confiscation,” she told NRK.
Denmark’s new bill has been heavily criticised by the international media and human rights groups.

Norway's rules aren't the only ones that are stricter than the provision passed in Denmark. Germany also long established rules on confiscating refugees’ valuables which are stricter than those set out by the new Danish law.
In Bavaria - where the vast majority of refugees arrive in the country - cash and valuables are confiscated with a value of over €750 (5,600 kroner). In the neighbouring southern state of Baden-Württemberg the rules are even stricter. There, refugees can have valuables worth more than €350 (2,600 kroner) taken from them.
Meanwhile in North Rhine-Westphalia refugees are only allowed to have €200 (1,500 kroner) in valuables before local authorities start taking their possessions."

If the number of people seeking asylum in Denmark does not begin to decline in 2015, Støjberg said that further action would be taken.

She did not specify what concrete measures may be in store, only ruling out that the government would disallow asylum seekers access to fundamental services such as health care.
The government’s new so-called ‘integration benefit’, announced yesterday, will replace the standard Danish unemployment benefits that jobless asylum seekers are currently entitled to.
The integration benefit will be lowered to the level of Danish student grants, meaning that a single adult with no children will receive 5,945 kroner per month before tax, compared to the current 10,849 kroner unemployment benefit – a 45 percent cut.
The Danish Refugee Council does not expect that the integration benefit, nor future restrictions, will help reduce the number of refugees coming to Denmark.
“I do not believe that the measures will have any meaningful significance on the flow of refugees coming to Europe, and consequently Denmark,” said General Secretary Andreas Kamm to Jyllands-Posten.
The number of asylum seekers in Denmark nearly doubled in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013.
The rising numbers indicate that 2015 may become another record year. According to DIS, 2,853 refugees came to Denmark between January 1st and May 31st, 2014, whereas 2,995 have done so in the same period this year."

“If you want to seek happiness in Europe, Denmark is not the right place.”
That’s the message that the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) wants to send loud and clear to asylum seekers.
DF spokesman Martin Henriksen is calling on Denmark to replicate Australia by releasing a video in English and Arabic that will discourage asylum seekers from making their way to Danish shores.
“Too many people are coming to Denmark to seek asylum and we want them to stay away from Denmark. That is the message we wish to formulate to human smugglers and potential asylum seekers around the world,” Henriksen told Politiko.
Henriksen pointed to a video made by the Australian government, in which a stone-faced General Campbell tells asylum seekers “you will not make Australia home”.
Henriksen wants Denmark to make a similar message that will include information about new restrictions on gaining asylum in Denmark and bringing family members to the country as well as the newly-announced cuts to refugees' benefits.
Governing party Venstre initially expressed a willingness to consider DF’s idea but as backlash to the proposal began to spread on Wednesday, Venstre spokesman Jakob Ellemann-Jensen threw cold water on the idea.
“I don’t think the Australian video is an example to replicate in Denmark. The video is a bit tough and I don’t think it is a Danish way to communicate. It’s fine if it works in Australia, but I can’t immediately see it being used in Denmark,” Ellemann-Jensen told Politiko.
Australia has implemented a strict policy of denying entry to boats filled with refugees and sending them out of Australian waters.
This is not the first time that DF has proposed using video to keep unwanted elements out of the country. In 2010, the party argued that an introductory film about Denmark should include shots of topless women sunbathing on the beach. DF contended that the bare breasts would keep extremists away by signalling that Denmark is a country with liberal attitudes and gender equality. The proposal did not get adopted."

Least of all in Denmark, where Norway’s southern neighbour has also introduced a long line of initiatives meant to discourage would-be asylum seekers.
Following the presentation of Norway’s bill on Tuesday, several Danish parties that support the current Venstre minority government said Denmark should adopt some of the Norwegian approach.
Of particular interest to the Danish parties is a provision in the Norwegian bill allowing Norway to deny entry to all asylum seekers who do not come directly from countries in conflict in emergency situations.
The provision would only be implemented if the Norwegian government concludes that the European response to a new large influx of refugees “does not work”. PM Erna Solberg also previously said that the legislation could be implemented “in the event that it all breaks down”, pointing specifically to the strain on neighbouring Sweden, which took in 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and expects an additional 100,000 this year.
Under the emergency provision, asylum seekers entering from Russia or other Nordic countries would be immediately rejected at the border if they are not coming directly from areas of conflict.
The anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) proposed last month that Denmark implement a similar plan to turn people away at the border if it can be proven that they came from a safe country.
Following Tuesday’s presentation of the Norwegian bill, the party once again called on Danish Integration Minister Inger Støjberg to pursue a similar measure.
“That the Norwegians are taking this step is completely understandable. Many of the asylum seekers who come to the Nordics have been in other countries, including the Nordic countries,” DF spokesman Peter Skaarup told Politiken.
“Just as they [the Norwegians] have a challenge in relation to the other Nordic countries, we have a challenge in relation to Germany, which we also consider to be a safe country,” he added.
Simon Emil Ammitzbøll, a spokesman for government support party Liberal Alliance, said it was “completely unbelievable” that Denmark hasn’t stopped people arriving from safe countries from seeking asylum.
“We can look enviously to Norway and I can’t see a single reason for why we shouldn’t do the same,” he told Politiken.
As is the case in Norway itself, opinions of the country’s hardline approach are split.
Danish opposition party the Social Liberals (Radikale) slammed the Norwegian asylum approach.
“It’s a crazy proposal. The Norwegian government is challenging basic human rights and is actually saying that there are situations in which they don’t apply,” party spokeswoman Sofie Carsten Nielsen told Politken.
The Norwegian asylum package was presented to parliament on Tuesday and will go to an open hearing on April 28th.
On Friday, Norwegian Integration Minister Sylvi Listhaug will visit her Danish counterpart Støjberg in Copenhagen but the latter declined to comment on whether Denmark had plans to copy the Norwegian provision."

That latter fact did not sit well with the committee’s chairman, Martin Henriksen of the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party.
“As far as I know this is the first time that Syrians have chosen to go back to Syria. And that says something about the fact that they are not as persecuted as they say they are,” he told broadcaster DR.
Henriksen said that the large number of application withdraws should serve as proof that those seeking asylum in Denmark are “convenience refugees”.
“They are migrants who are not fleeing directly from war but move around between countries to find the place where they can live the best life,” he said.
Støjberg said that in addition to the 279 asylum seekers who formally withdrew their applications, there could be a large number of others who have left the country without informing officials.
Those who leave through proper channels have their return airline tickets purchased by the Danish government.
Denmark received more than 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, a 44 percent jump from 2014. The number of asylum seekers has dropped significantly since the start of the year, when Denmark implemented border control measures that have since been extended six times.
While 641 asylum seekers entered the country in the week after border controls were introduced, just 45 came last week according to police data compiled by the government."

Johnny Bergenholz Jensen received a one year and six month prison term for attempting to set the Lyngbygård asylum centre on fire and torching a minivan on the property. No person was injured in the attack.
Bergenholz Jensen also drew swastikas, writing ""first warning"" and ""DNSB"", an acronym that refers to the National Socialist Movement of Denmark, on the building.
The asylum centre, run by the Red Cross, mainly houses families who have applied for asylum in Denmark. It was the third time the asylum centre was attacked last year.
Bergenholz Jensen said in his defence that be believed that non-Europeans should not live in Denmark and that he had carried out the attacks in protest at government policy, Danish broadcaster DR reported.
In court, Bergenholz Jensen said he did had not intended to harm the residents of the centre.
""I did not want to go after the residents of the refugee centre personally . If I had done so, I could have chosen to burn the centre down,"" he said.
The court took Bergenholz Jensen's racist motives into account when the verdict was announced, a decision the man's lawyer Lars Henriksen may use to mount an appeal, as he claims the racist motive is not clear.
""I find it a bit odd,"" Henriksen told Denmark's BT newspaper. ""The Attorney-General has decided that there will be a prosecution for racism in this case. Yet we spent most of the day talking about possible racist motives. It is also part of the verdict and sentencing. I am puzzled.""
Bergenholz Jensen has admitted to the crimes he was charged with.
""I regret what has happened. It's not a good way of doing politics,"" he said before the verdict according to Danish newspaper Ekstrabladet."

According to numbers released by the Immigration Ministry, just 36 people applied for asylum between August 22-28, marking the lowest weekly total of 2016.
It is also the sixth consecutive week in which the number of asylum applications has been below 100.
Denmark implemented border control measures on January 4th in response to a similar move by Swedish authorities. Since then, the ostensibly temporary measures have been extended numerous times.
In May, Denmark joined Sweden, Austria, Belgium, France and Germany in appealing to the European Commission for an extension of temporary controls at the internal borders of the Schengen area, as part of efforts to more closely monitor migration flows.
With the Commission’s approval, Denmark then extended its border controls through November 12th.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told news agency Ritzau on Thursday that the government’s moves have had their intended effect.
“Border controls have given us far better opportunities to manage both security and the flow of migrants. Border controls have been instrumental in maintaining public order and internal security in Denmark,” Støjberg said.
The Danish government is poised to present a comprehensive 2025 plan on Tuesday and it is expected that the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party will push hard for making Denmark’s border controls permanent. The party also wants to be able to deny asylum applications at the nation’s borders.
Through the first eight months of 2016, some 4,700 asylum seekers have come to Denmark. Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, making it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants but putting it far behind the 163,000 registered in neighbouring Sweden."

					16:57 CET+01:00				",Michael Barrett,Danish immigration minister escorted from deportation centre as tensions boil over,"Denmark’s minister for Immigration and Integration Inger Støjberg was hastily evacuated from the Sjælsmark deportation centre for rejected asylum seekers after tensions escalated during a tense visit to the facility.
Støjberg was escorted from the centre by security guards after an incident while she was visiting the centre, reports broadcaster DR.
The minister was at the Sjælsmark deportation centre as part of filming for the broadcaster’s 21 Søndag current affairs programme, according to the report.
Red-Green Alliance MP Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen was also at the centre in connection with the programme.
The group had visited a family accommodated at the facility to talk about conditions for children living there when the situation escalated to the extent that personal security guards and police officers decided to remove Støjberg from the site, according to DR’s report.
North Zealand Police confirmed to newspaper Politiken that the minister was unhurt during the incident.
“When we came outside after the visit, the atmosphere started getting aggressive. Residents started gathering around Støjberg,” journalist Martin Torpe, who was present during the visit, told DR.
Around 40 people gathered outside during the minister’s meeting with the Iraqi Kurd family, writes Politiken.
“Some people were shouting and taking hold of her. Eventually she was escorted to the minister’s car. Then a number of people gathered around the car and attempted to prevent it from driving away. A woman who was very upset threw herself on to the hood while the car was moving,” Torpe continued, adding that the events unfolded rapidly.
“As far as I could see, [the protesting woman] fell down in front of the car and may have been hit a little,” he said.
Nobody is thought to have been seriously hurt, according to Politiken’s report of the incident.
Several residents were already unhappy prior to the incident due to the fact that the minister only had time to speak to one family, thereby only learning of their individual circumstances, according to DR.
Journalist Olav Hergel, who was also at the scene, told Politiken that unrest spread after a rumour emerged that the family would be granted asylum after being visited by the minister.
Hergel described the situation as ""threatening"".
Sjælsmark is one of two so-called udrejsecentre (departure or expulsion centres) in Denmark, with the second centre located at Kærshovedgård in Jutland.
The centres house rejected asylum seekers who have not yet left Danish territory, for example due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.
Others do not agree with the outcome of their asylum application or are unable to be voluntarily returned to their home countries due to the danger they believe that will place them under.
Last month, residents at the Kærshovedgård centre protested against what they felt were intolerable living conditions at that facility.
Not being allowed to make their own food or volunteer to work at the centre, along with being cut off from society and repeated police interviews contributed to “making conditions intolerable"" for residents, Martin Lemberg-Pedersen, assistant professor in Global Refugee Studies at Aalborg University's Department of Culture and Global Studies, told The Local in October in connection with the Kærshovedgård protest.
""This kind of camp technology places already-vulnerable people in intolerable situations, and centres like this have a track record of breaking people down. Research tells us that people reach a threshold after which they begin to break down, with a range of severe psychological and psychosomatic consequences,” the assistant professor said.
Sjælsmark resident Valid Rahmati, who has been in Denmark for five years, told Politiken that he could “understand why people are angry.”
“They had baked cakes, bought flowers and made signs on which the words ‘we are not criminals’ are written. But we are all [considered to be] problems, so all she did was go in and talk to one chosen family,” Rahmati said.
Rahmati confirmed to Politken reports that rumours spread that the Kurdish family would be given special treatment as a result of the visit.
In a Facebook post on Friday afternoon, Støjberg thanked security personnel and her chauffeur for their response to the incident.
“Without you things could have ended very badly,” she wrote.

Roskilde’s Food Hall is under a roof, it is raining hard, and people are hungry. There are queues at all of the dozens of food stands. Not least at Sisters’ Cuisine.
Signs stuck to the hoarding above the counter reveal the menu at the stand: Persian veggie deal, Thai spring roll plate, Classic Tatar sandwich.
Behind the counter an all-female team works at chopping boards, saucepans and cash registers.
The 180 food stands at Roskilde Festival are run by a mixture of established service providers and organisations that don’t specialise in food.
Sister’s Cuisine, run by Copenhagen immigration activist organisation Trampoline House, falls into both and none of these categories.

“We want to open a small restaurant of our own, but this is a start,” says Tone O. Nielsen, a coordinator with Trampoline House, an independent community centre in Copenhagen that acts as a place of support for refugees and asylum seekers in Denmark.
3,500 people visit the organisation’s centre annually, where 200 volunteers give job training, advice and provide a social context for asylum seekers lacking a network outside of the facility in which they live.
Started in 2010 as an art project and now functioning as a community house with a range of weekly events and initiatives, Trampoline House includes as part of its weekly programme a women-only event.
“It is doubly hard to be a woman asylum seeker,” says Nielsen, adding that the centre’s events and meetings are “basically for anyone who feels a bit displaced in normative Danish society.”
Wanting to do something “more sustainable” with the project, Nielsen says that the women’s group has now branched from dinners every Tuesday and Friday into volunteer catering.
“It’s a big move for them to get into this setting. It’s a whole new challenge,” says Paula Duvå, who also volunteers with the organisation, gesturing towards the bustling queue and the women working behind the counter – who, Nielsen points out, represent as wide a range of nationalities and backgrounds as any other stand in the hall.
“Some of us are volunteers, others have cooking experience from their home countries,” Nielsen says.
“Some of them were raised in patriarchal households and learned to cook that way, others actually can’t cook at first,” she adds.
Duvå explains that life inside asylum centres can be uneventful, and the allowance given to people living in them does not allow for many trips outside.
“There are two things we really want to do with this. One is to get people out of the camps. The second is to provide them with some form of work, since it’s illegal for them to take on paid employment in Denmark,” says Duvå.
Mandana Yamolaei, an Iranian refugee who spent eight years living in Danish asylum centres before being granted asylum in 2008, comes out from behind the counter having finished her shift at the stand.
“This is a great privilege for me. I’ve worked in kitchens in places like Sandholm [asylum centre, ed.], but haven’t tried anything like this before,” she says.

“It’s very exciting. There are so many happy people here, it gives me the energy to keep working,” says Yamolaei, a trained cook.
Because of high demand, the Iranian has taken on extra shifts on two separate days, working 16 hours in a day in one case.
“It doesn’t matter. The energy here just rubs off on you,” she says.
Despite the extra hours being put in by volunteers, Nielsen is confident that the Sisters’ Cuisine stand has been a success.
“We were very popular yesterday. There was a big line. Maybe that’s because we are slower than the others. But there was a big line,” she says."

In a press release sent prior to Friday’s protest, Eritrean asylum seekers and refugees stressed that they “are very thankful to Danish people and to their democratic government for hospitality and liberty”. “We want to assure the Danish people that we are law-abiding citizens and hardworking people who are made to abandon their beloved country and family due to gross human rights violations in Eritrea,” the press release reads.

International standards are on occasions not met by Denmark’s processes for dealing with young asylum seekers, according to a report by the international charity.
The report looks into management of child refugees in all of the Nordic countries.
A particular area of concern is the way in which Denmark assesses the age of asylum seekers, Unicef Denmark general secretary Steen Andersen said.
“We are not good enough – none of the Nordic countries are – at ascertaining whether asylum seekers are under or over 18 years old.
“In those cases, we believe the child should be given the benefit of the doubt,” Andersen said.
Age is crucial in determining access to things like the school system and health service, the Unicef Denmark leader said.
Concerns are also raised in the report that minor-aged asylum seekers are not listened to in family cases that affect them – a practise that is otherwise standard in Denmark.
The report also recommends Denmark look into ways in which children given asylum can be introduced into the regular school system more quickly, and that they should be given the same access to services as Danish children.
Andersen said that it was difficult to determine the exact extent to which Denmark was falling short of its international commitments in the area.
“We can say that we have found cases in which our guidelines are unclear, thereby causing problems,” he said.
120,000 children have applied for asylum in the Nordic countries since 2015. 10,000 of these applications were in Denmark.

Unknown perpetrators vandalized the Red Cross’s Lyngbygaard asylum centre in the early morning hours of Thursday with a swastika and a message that this was the centre’s “first warning”, East Jutland Police said in a press release.
A minibus used by the centre, which hosts around 120 asylum seekers, was also set on fire. According to police, the car fire did not pose any danger to the centre’s residents.
Along with the swastika and warning, the graffiti on the building's garage also included the initials DNSB, short for ‘Danmarks Nationalsocialistiske Bevægelse’ or the National Socialist Movement of Denmark.
Police said that the asylum centre has also been previously been targeted by vandals.
“This is the third time that the asylum centre has been subjected to vandalism with an apparent political motive,” police wrote.
The other two incidents occurred on March 20th and July 31st and according to TV2, the initials ‘DNSB’ were also spray-painted on the building in the previous attacks.
Police said on Thursday that they believe that the same people were behind all three incidents of vandalism but had not identified any potential subjects.
A volunteer at the asylum centre said the first two incidents were largely written off as pranks.
“But it isn’t that now that a car has been set on fire,” Erik Boye Kirk told broadcaster DR, adding that the “cynical” people who vandalized Lyngbygaard were likely inspired by recent events in Germany.

On Tuesday evening in northern Germany, two drunk men broke into a refugee housing block carrying a knife and an unknown attacker set a fire in a building that was scheduled to be used as refugee accommodation in Leipzig. That fire was the third within a week set at a refugee and asylum-seeker home in Germany.
Germany also saw violent clashes between far-right protesters and police over last weekend in Saxon in what Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned as “repulsive” and “shameful”.

The minister gave an instruction in February 2016 to forcibly separate all asylum-seeking couples including individuals under 18 years of age, regardless of whether the couples had children.
The Ministry of Immigration (Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet) was subsequently advised by the Ministry of Justice that individual assessments of cases would be required before couples could be separated, according to the report.
But Støjberg went ahead with her order, informing parliament on March 9th last year that “no minor-aged asylum seekers under 18 years of age can be accommodated together with their spouse or partner from now on.”
On July 1st 2016, new directives were issued by the immigration ministry stipulating individual assessments, and separated couples were again allowed to live at the same accommodation.
But an internal ministry mail was also sent warning Støjberg of the legal issues with the order on 9th February 2016, the day before she made the order, reports newspaper Politiken.
Støjberg cut a key passage from the draft instruction put together by ministry officials relating to individual assessment of cases, rendering it illegal, according to the report.
In its review of the case, the Parliamentary ombudsman also stated that internal emails detailing the ministry’s “legal considerations” on separation of asylum couples were not logged properly – also an illegal action – and were first provided to the ombudsman at the second request in May 2016.
Politiken reported Sunday that a Syrian couple has been advised to take legal action against the minister after they were forcibly separated by Støjberg's instruction.

The couple, Rimaz Alkayal and Alnour Alwan, who arrived in Denmark in 2015 and were 17 and 26 years old at the time, were forced to separate by the February 2016 order.
Four months later they received a mail from the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen) informing them that the forced separation had been too “invasive” and that they had been given permission to live together at an asylum centre again, reports Politiken.
“We oppose forced marriages, they destroy families and should be prevented. But I still don’t understand why the authorities can’t distinguish between individual cases,” Alwan told Politiken.
The couple filed a complaint with the parliamentary ombudsman, which in March ruled Støjberg’s intervention illegal, calling it “particularly criticisable”.
A total of 34 couples, many of which had children, were affected by the instruction given by Støjberg.
Opposition parties have called for full details of the Ministry of Immigration communication over the issue to now be released.
“It is very obvious to me that everything must be laid on the table now. There seem to have bee warnings sent to [Støjberg] before the instruction was issued, and it seems as though important information was simply not given to parliament,” said Social Liberal (Radikale Venstre) immigration spokesperson Sofie Carsten Nielsen.
Politiken reports that Støjberg has not ruled out being warned verbally of the issue with the legality of the instruction, but said to the newspaper that nothing in writing was received by her.
Immigration spokesperson and former foreign minister Holger K. Nielsen of the Socialist People’s Party said that Støjberg was in “deep water” over the issue.
“Verbal warnings are just as serious as written ones, so if the head of department, for example, has given her the information, she has a problem,” Holger K. Nielsen said to Politiken."

Current trends point towards Sweden also gradually following the Danish line, according to the expert.
Denmark’s internationally criticized asylum policies are beginning to look like a model for the Scandinavian countries, after Norway’s Minister of Integration Sylvi Listhaug presented a series of new measures that she claimed would make Oslo’s asylum policies “Europe’s toughest.”
Kristian Kriegsbaum Jensen, a PhD student in Scandinavian integration policy at Aarhus University, told state broadcaster DR that Norway’s proposed new rules resemble those of Denmark “incredibly” closely.
Norway’s government wants to make family reunification harder as well as introduce stricter criteria for permanent residence to be granted.
“It is almost a copy of Denmark,” said Jensen, while noting that Norway, unlike Denmark, has not yet reduced welfare payments for refugees.
“Denmark has cut back on payments to refugees – so far, this has not been suggested in Norway,” said Jensen.
While Sweden has received significantly more asylum applications – around 190,000 compared to Denmark’s 18,492 (not including December) and 35,358 for Norway in 2015 – Sweden’s policies are also beginning to follow the examples set by its two Scandinavian neighbours, albeit at a slower pace.
Although Sweden has not cut welfare support and does not require asylum seekers to have language skills in order to be granted asylum, it has begun to tighten its family reunification and residency rules.
All three countries have now also introduced border controls.
“Sweden has a softer approach, but is basically using the same ideas. Denmark, Norway and Sweden are all following a formula whereby they try to make themselves less attractive for refugees relative to their neighbours,” Andreas Kamm, general secretary with the Danish Refugee Council, told DR."

Jannich Bisp, a supervisor at the centre, told the newspaper that concerns have been raised about a group of teenage boys.
“There are situations in which the boys receive a phone call, take off for a few hours and then come back with designer clothes,” Bisp said.
“We are worried about where the boys are getting the money,” he added.
The concerns at Center Sandholm, located some 30 kilometres north of Copenhagen, came to light after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan reported similar stories about refugee children at the Aleris Asylum Center in Malmö. There too officials said that the young asylum seekers would get phone calls, disappear for a few hours and then return with money or new clothes.
At Sandholm, personnel say that there have been a few occasions in which the teenage boys have reported sexual abuse but the teens left the centre before any action could be taken.
Bisp said that many of the teens in the asylum centre have a hard time trusting the workers there.
“This is a group of boys that have been treated poorly by adults and have maybe been abused throughout their lives. We use a lot of time creating comfort and trust between us and the boys but if they finally open up, they often disappear again before we can follow up on the case,” he told Berlingske.
He said that that some of the boys have told staff that “there is someone in Copenhagen who organizes prostitution”.
“We contact the police every time but it is hard for the police to do anything with the case when the boys won’t say anything more,” he said.
Caroline Madsen of the Danish Red Cross, which runs three other children’s refugee centres across Denmark, said that similar concerns have not been aired elsewhere as far as she knows.
""The staff is trained to observe disturbing and divergent behaviour, and we work in close cooperation with both the municipality and the Centre against Human Trafficking, which sometimes comes and talks with the kids if we have a particular concern,"" Madsen told Berlingske."

The fight between boys at the children’ asylum centres Børnecenter Tullebølle and Børnecenter Hundstrup broke out after a football match between the two groups on Saturday but was reported by TV2 Fyn on Wednesday evening.
Ulrik Pihl, the leader of the Holmegaard Asylum Centre, which administers the Tullebølle centre, told TV2 Fyn that things got out of hand after a referee gave a free kick to one of the clubs. A player heatedly disputed the call and things quickly escalated from there.
Witnesses told TV2 Fyn that upwards of 100 boys were involved in the violent fight.
A couple who lives next to the football pitch said part of the brawl spilled over into their yard and up to 15 boys went at it with both their fists and iron chains.
“We sat in the living room and heard a bunch of yelling and screaming from the yard. When we looked out we saw these ten to 15 boys wailing away on one another. It was a pure blood frenzy,” Karen Marie told TV2 Fyn.
Marie said that she and her husband then saw a group attack the bus that was transporting the boys from Børnecenter Hundstrup away from the scene. A photo from TV2 Fyn shows that one of the bus's windows was smashed in.
She and her husband called police but by the time officers showed up, calm and order had been restored.
""After a conversation with the police, we agreed it was best if we internally fount out who had an active role in the fight and who tried to stop it. And that's why it took a few days before we chose to report them to the police,"" Pihl told TV2 Fyn.
Marie said the incident has made her feel uneasy about living next to Børnecenter Tullebølle.
“Our own grandchildren can’t visit us anymore because their parents are afraid of what could happen if they are out playing in the yard at the wrong time,” she said.
The leaders of the asylum centre will attempt to assuage neighbours’ fears at an open meeting on Thursday evening."

The woman was beaten, attacked with flammable fluid and shot at after she refused an arranged marriage and instead wed a Pakistani man with Danish residence, her lawyer Niels-Erik Hansen told Politiken.
The woman's marriage took place in 2007, before she was forced to return to Pakistan in 2009 following the expiration of her visa, reports Politiken.
It was then that she was subjected to several episodes of violent abuse, and spent seven months in hospital with severe burns.
The woman later returned to Denmark and applied for family reunification. When this was rejected, she applied for asylum on the basis that she believed her life would be in danger should she return to Pakistan.
“In spite of this, the Danish authorities decided to deport her back to Pakistan,” Hansen told Politiken.
The FN rejected the woman's appeal on the basis of lack of evidence that the threats to her life came from her family, who are against her marriage.
But the UN's Commission on the Status of Women says that the motives are irrelevant – the woman is demonstrably at risk of gender-related violence in Pakistan and therefore entitled to asylum in Denmark.
Because of the UN ruling, the deportation has now been delayed – the first time the women's committee has decided the outcome of such a forced deportation in Denmark, said Hansen, who is also chairperson of the Society of Immigrant Rights Lawyers.
The Refugee Appeals Board (Flygtningenævn, FN) must now decide whether to reopen its case.
The case does, however, represent a trend of UN committee involvement in deportation cases. The Human Rights Commission has, for example, upheld five appeals against deportation rulings by the FN by finding them to be human rights violations.
“I cannot remember so many cases going against Denmark [as there have been recently],” Hansen told Politiken."

The Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) announced on Wednesday that the centre for unaccompanied underage asylum seekers will be shut down this week.
According to a DIS press release, the agency was informed last week that two female employees of the centre are suspected of having sexually violated one or more boys under the age of 18.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told broadcaster DR that the two women in question were removed from their posts and that Funen Police will now investigate the sexual assault claims.
The sexual assault suspicions are several months old, but Støjberg said that neither she nor DIS were informed until last week.
“Sexually assaults at a centre like this should have immediately been reported to me by Langeland Municipality,” she told DR.
Langeland’s mayor, Bjarne Nielsen, told DR that he himself did not hear about the allegations until recently and blamed the centre’s staff.
“It is completely unacceptable and we will take it up with the leadership,” he said.
The new allegations are the latest in a series of problems at the centre, which houses roughly 40 underage boys.
Earlier this month, the centre’s residents were involved in a mass brawl. No one was seriously injured but an employee of the centre was struck by a 15-year-old boy with a metal pipe.
In August, five teenage boys from the centre were charged for sexual assaults committed during the Langelandsfestival. Three were charged with groping, and two for raping a 16-year-old girl.
The month prior, boys from the centre took part in a fight involving upwards of 100 minor asylum seekers during a football match against residents of another asylum centre.
Støjberg said on Wednesday that it was time to close down the troubled facility.
“The centre will be closed because there have quite simply been too many instances of violence amongst the young boys, violence and threats against the personnel and other completely unacceptable behaviour on the part of the youths,” she told DR.
“Additionally, I was informed on Saturday that there have been serious allegations against the two female employees about sexually violating some of the boys,” Støjberg added.
According to DIS, the roughly 40 residents of Børnecenter Tullebølle will be transferred to other underage asylum centres across Denmark."

Newly-released figures from the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen – DIS) revealed that 1,038 people sought asylum in Denmark in July. That figure represents a significant decrease from July 2014, when 1,733 asylum seekers came to Denmark.
Through the first seven months of 2015, a total of 5,174 people have sought asylum in Denmark compared to 5,595 over the same period last year. However, August and September of 2014 were by far the biggest single months in terms of asylum numbers, with 2,302 and 3,147 respectively. According to a report in Berlingske newspaper, August 2015 is expected to end with over 1,500 asylum seekers and DIS has previously estimated that 2015 is likely to end as another record year.
The current Venstre government has announced plans to drastically cut the benefits that refugees are entitled to, arguing that the cuts will make it ‘less attractive’ to come to Denmark. The government also plans to run advertisements in foreign newspapers publicising these cuts and has said it wants to base its acceptance of UN quota refugees on their ability to integrate.

The benefit reductions come after the previous Social Democrat-led government introduced a new, temporary type of residence permit for asylum seekers fleeing civil wars such as the Syrian conflict following the September 2014 peak in asylum numbers. The previous government also implemented new restrictions on the ability of refugees to have their family members join them in Denmark.

The anti-immigration Danish People’s Party said that despite July’s fall in asylum numbers, there are still too many people coming to Denmark.
“The only positive thing one can say is that the numbers for July are lower than the same month last year and that the amount is generally being held down in relation to the massive influx that Europe is experiencing. But you can’t use that to explain away the fact that there are still too many coming to Denmark,” party spokesman Martin Henriksen told Berlingske.
Syrians continue to represent the largest group of asylum seekers. With the 479 Syrians who came to Denmark in July, 2,142 have sought Danish asylum thus far in 2015. In 2014, that number was 7,087.
The Syrians are fleeing a brutal civil war that has been raging for over four years and has killed as many as 300,000 and displaced an estimated 10.9 million Syrians, or almost half of the country’s population."

The Social Democrats on Tuesday backed a proposal from the populist Danish People's Party to empower the police to ban young asylum seekers from leaving their accommodation centres as a punishment for misbehaviour.
""These are young people under 18 years old. I therefore see nothing wrong in imposing an exit ban on them,"" Trine Bramsen the party's spokesman, told Denmark's DR broadcaster.
Her comments came after five boys of between 14 and 17 years old from Tullebølle asylum centre were charged for sexual misdemeanours committed at the nearby Langeland festival on the island of Funen. Three were charged with groping, and two for raping a 16-year-old girl.
Martin Henriksen, the DPP’s immigration spokesman, told the Jyllands-Posten newspaper last week that police needed to have some way of punishing young asylum seekers.
“The police should be allowed to issue exit bans on the centers if they believe that there is a need for it, until they can get to grips with the situation,"" he said.
Henriksen proposed the ban for asylum seekers under the age of 18, but Bramsen said she saw no reason why over-18-year-olds could not also be confined.
She said it was “completely unreasonable"" to let young refugees who misbehaved to move freely in society.
“These young people will have to learn the Danish rules of the game - also when it comes to the opposite sex,” she said. ""What we have seen at Langeland is simply unreasonable and must be stopped.""
Denmark’s immigration minister Inger Støjberg meanwhile on Tuesday refused calls to set up special high-security centres for troublesome immigrants, arguing that it would be better to split up the most difficult cases.
“I do not think it would be the best solution to gather them all at one centre,” Støjberg said. “I think it is much better to split them up, so they cannot run around in gangs.”"

An explosion in the number of asylum seekers from Eritrea has Denmark’s justice minister worried about human trafficking. Throughout the first quarter of 2014, roughly ten Eritrean asylum seekers arrived in Denmark each month. In July, that number jumped to 510, raising red flags for Justice Minister Karen Hækkerup. “We need to learn more about who the asylum seekers from Eritrea are, why they are coming to Denmark and if they have a legitimate need for protection. If not, they should be sent back,” Hækkerup said in a press release. The Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen) is currently investigating the situation and until its results are ready, Denmark will not be granting asylum to Eritreans. Hækkerup said that the sharp increase in asylum seekers could be a sign of organised human trafficking. “It is quite striking when the travel pattern of a particular group of asylum seekers suddenly changes so radically and without any obvious explanation, as is the case here. I know that the police have a strong focus on fighting human trafficking and the Danish National Police have announced that there is already a comprehensive effort underway to determine if this could be a case of organised human trafficking,” she said. The International Crisis Group warned earlier this month that Eritrea was facing an acute “youth exodus”, with large portions of the nation’s young people fleeing the Eritrean government’s authoritarian rule. “The impact of the exodus on final-destination countries demands a new approach to the current Eritrean government. In a Europe where immigration policies are increasingly in question, the Eritrean problem cannot be ignored”, Comfort Ero, the International Crisis Group’s African programme director, said in a statement. Last month, a man was arrested for smuggling six Eriteans across the Øresund Bridge, while a van filled with Eritreans was turned away at the border between Italy and Austria. Just this week, the Italian navy said that it has saved nearly 100,000 boat migrants this year, most of them from Eritrea, Somalia and Syria.

					08:18 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Danish People’s Party wants barbed wire fence on Germany border,"The nationalist Danish People’s Party wants to put up a barbed wire fence with motion sensors on Denmark’s border with Germany.
The party recently visited the border between Hungary and Serbia in order to study border security methods, reports newspaper Politiken.
In addition to the fence along its border, Hungary's model includes detainment of asylum seekers in camps for unlimited time periods while their applications are reviewed.
The model used by Hungary on its border with non-EU Serbia should be copied by Denmark, says Anders Vistisen, group chairperson with the Danish People’s Party (DF) in the EU Parliament.
DF is currently Denmark's second-biggest party, holding 37 of parliament's 179 seats, but is not part of the centre-right coalition government.
“We in DF are very excited about what we experienced in Hungary. The model is identical to the one we propose be introduced between Denmark and Germany,” said Vistisen to Politiken.
The fence would consist of a three-metre border fence with barbed wire, motion sensors and surveillance cameras.
EU politicians and a number of international organisations have criticised the methods used in Hungary. Denmark’s state Refugee Board (Flygtningenævnet) recently announced that it found conditions for asylum seekers in Hungary too insecure for Denmark to send its own refugees to the central European country.
“It was not luxury in any way, but conditions were perfectly fine for the purpose, which is to detain people until their asylum applications have been processed,” said Vistisen.
The Danish People’s Party has long called for tight border control with Germany.
Vistisen told Politiken that he saw the system as having the potential to enable Denmark to return 95 percent of its asylum seekers to Germany, since Denmark would be able to prove that people detained on the border had already been in a country in which they could have applied for asylum.
“If the Germans have a problem with it – if they say that the refugees come from Greece or Austria – then the Germans will just have to get control of their own borders,” Vistisen said.
The 174-kilometre fence between Hungary and Serbia - which is not encompassed by the same rules as internal EU borders - cost Hungary $602 million dollars to erect, reports Politiken. A similar cost corrected for the length of the Denmark-Germany border would give Denmark a bill of around 1.5 billion kroner ($226 million).
In 2015, the hitherto peak year for asylum seeker arrivals in the EU, Hungary took in 177,000 asylum seekers and Denmark 21,000, according to the newspaper.
Denmark's oft-extended emergency border controls were introduced in January 2016 and have seen border police return to the frontier with Germany.
The Scandinavian country was recently encouraged by the EU to phase out the border checks it currently has in place on its borders with Germany over the next six months.
A situation in which the EU would grant Denmark permission to erect a barbed wire fence on its border is “unthinkable”, said Frank McNamara, border control expert with thinktank European Policy Centre.
“EU institutions are against border fences. They have said this again and again. And the EU is generally against the Hungarian model. I think it is laughable to suggest that model can be used between Denmark and Hungary,” McNamara told Politiken.
Vistisen told the newspaper that he was aware that the fence would likely breach EU rules, but that DF is prepared to risk a trial over the issue.
“Schengen rules aren’t being followed at the moment,” he said, with reference to the current ID checks on the Denmark-Germany border.
Morten Løkkegaard, EU Parliament representative with Denmark’s governing Liberal (Venstre) Party, called the DF proposal “absurd”.
“If you want to barricade Denmark with bricks and fences, you can take inspiration [from Hungary], but the Liberal party does not support that. It makes no sense to throw a three-metre fence up in the middle of Europe,” Løkkegaard told Politiken."

Swiss asylum law has since the 1990s required asylum seekers to contribute to the costs of hosting them in the wealthy Alpine country.
The country is permitted to confiscate from people seeking asylum in the country amounts over 1,000 Swiss francs ($995, 913 euros), Celine Kohlprath, a spokeswoman for Swiss migration authorities, told AFP.
Kohlprath's statement confirmed information revealed in a debate programme on the public SRF channel on Thursday.
""This practice is based on the fact that Switzerland (wants) people arriving in Switzerland to contribute as far as possible to the costs of the asylum process and the social assistance provided,"" she wrote in an email.
An information notice given to asylum seekers on arrival was displayed on Thursday's ""10 vor 10"" debate programme, stating: ""If you have ... more than 1,000 Swiss francs when you arrive at the reception centre, you must hand them over against a receipt.""
Kohlprath stressed that ""in practice, the person must have at least 1,500 Swiss francs in their pocket"" before any cash is confiscated.
The Swiss law also differs from the bill being debated by the Danish parliament in that it does not allow for material goods to be taken, she said.
The Danish proposal would allow authorities to seize asylum seekers' cash exceeding 10,000 kroner (1,340 euros, $1,450), as well as any individual items valued at more than 10,000 kroner.
Kohlprath's colleague Lea Wertheimer also told Thursday's programme that ""if a person leaves of their own accord within seven months, they can retrieve their money and take it with them.""
'Unfair'
A Syrian refugee invited to speak on the programme meanwhile showed a receipt he allegedly received from Swiss authorities in exchange for the money he had left over after paying off traffickers to get him and his family to Switzerland.
The married father of three insisted the law was ""unfair"".
Swiss law also requires refugees permitted to reside and work in the country to hand over 10 percent of their earnings over a 10-year-period, or up to 15,000 Swiss francs in total, to help cover the costs of their asylum process.
Stefan Frey of the Swiss Refugee Council lashed out against the measure, telling Thursday's programme it was ""disgraceful"".
The UN refugee agency, which has condemned the bill being debated by the Danish parliament cautioning it will fuel xenophobia, meanwhile said Friday it had previously raised concerns about the Swiss law with authorities.
""UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that, having to contribute a part of their salary, could be an obstacle to accessing the labour market and to the integration of asylum seekers and persons with recognised protection needs,"" spokesman William Spindler told AFP in an email.
""There is a new legislative proposal to abolish this provision and we would very much hope it will be adopted."""

Official DIS figures released on Monday confirmed that October set an all-time asylum record in Denmark with 3,646 applications.
With only two exceptions, the numbers increased month after month in 2015 and October’s total alone represents more asylum applications than Denmark received in all of 2011.
With the new applications in October, it looks almost certain that this year will top the 2014 totals, when 14,815 people sought asylum. That number represent a near doubling of 2013 totals and an almost fourfold increase over 2009, when just 3,855 asylum seekers came to the country.
Syrian asylum seekers were by far the largest group, with 1,459 Syrian applications processed in October. In 2014, Syrians accounted for just under half of all asylum cases.
Although Denmark recently implemented its third round of restrictions within the asylum area, the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) used the new figures to accuse the government of “doing nothing”.

Among the proposals that would be of particular interest to The Local’s readers are changes meant to make it harder for foreigners living in Denmark to obtain a permanent residence permit.
Saying “the government is working for Denmark to be open for those who can and will, but also to close the doors for those who can’t”, it announced plans to “tighten the rules further”.
The plans call for foreigners to first be able to obtain permanent residency after living in Denmark for eight years, as opposed to the current six. At the outset of 2016, that time period was just five years before it was increased as part of a comprehensive immigration bill.
Additionally, the government wants to further tighten the employment requirements so that foreigners will have to have been employed for 3.5 of the past four years when they apply for permanent residency. It’s currently required that foreigners have been employed for 2.5 of the past three years, but that too was changed as part of the January immigration bill. The previous rules called for employment for three of the past five years.
The government has tried to maintain an “incentive” for foreigners by saying that if they meet four supplementary conditions – displaying 'active citizenship' by participating in civic organizations or the passing of a citizenship test, steady employment for four of the past 4.5 years, an annual salary of 270,000 kroner for two years prior to application, or the completion of Danish 3 language courses – permanent residence can be achieved sooner.
It also wants to increase the incentive to leave the country, offering ""increased support for the repatriation of foreigners who have a residence permit"" in the form of financial payments to cover such things as health care and education in a foreigner's home country.
'Emergency brake' for asylum
The majority of the government’s immigration proposals have to do with asylum, which is currently at its lowest level since this year. Denmark has thus far received roughly 4,700 asylum seekers, a far cry from the 21,000 who came last year.
Nevertheless, the government entitled its plan ‘A Stronger Denmark: Control of the Refugee Flow’ and promised a number of initiatives to bring the number down even further. It said it expects 10,000 asylum seekers by the end of 2016, though that would require more to come in the next four months than in the previous eight.
“Even though the number of asylum seekers is lower this year than we initially expected, 10,000 asylum seekers is still too many and we want the number to go further down. At the same time, we need to be ready to handle an acute pressure if holes again emerge in Europe’s borders,” Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said in a press release.
The government wants to lay the groundwork for an ""emergency brake"" that can be initiated to reject asylum seekers at the border under ""a crisis situation"". It also calls for tougher requirements to qualify for the controversial 'integration benefit' introduced last year.
The government also says it will redistribute one billion kroner of money saved through asylum restrictions at home to countries like Syria, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
""The government's tight immigration policy and the EU's agreement with Turkey has led to significantly fewer asylum seekers in Denmark. This means that we can now move more money to helping refugees in the world's hotspots rather than asylum seekers in Brande and Brønderslev,"" Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen said in a separate press release.
