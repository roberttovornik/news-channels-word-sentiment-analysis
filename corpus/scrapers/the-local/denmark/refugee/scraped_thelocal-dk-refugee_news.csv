					13:34 CET+01:00				", The Local,Why do refugees prefer Sweden to Denmark?,"Border controls were recently reinstated between Denmark and Sweden. But The Local looks into why so many new arrivals would still rather seek asylum east of the famous Öresund bridge.
1. It's a numbers game
Put simply, Sweden takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation, while Denmark has a track record for adopting some of the toughest immigration policies in Europe.
Almost 163,000 refugees sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, according to the country's migration agency, compared to Denmark's 18,000.
Around 9.5 million people live in Sweden while there are 5.6 million in Denmark.
2. Sweden has offered permanent residency to all Syrian arrivals
Refugees fleeing the violence in Syria make up the largest proportion of people seeking asylum across Europe and in 2013 Sweden became the first country in Europe to rule that all refugees from the war-torn nation would be granted permanent residency in the light of the worsening conflict.
However the Swedish government announced plans to tighten the rules again again in November 2015.
Denmark introduced temporary one-year permits for Syrian refugees last year with the stated intention of sending them back home ""as soon as conditions improve"" in the war-ravaged country.

3. Many refugees already have family in Sweden
Given the huge numbers of Syrians who have already been given protection in Sweden (16,785 in 2014 alone), it is unsurprising that many refugees would prefer to set up home close to friends and family.
Sweden has previously offered residency permits to immediate family members of those already granted asylum (husband, wife, partner and children - under the age of 18), but announced stricter time limits in November.
Last year, Denmark said it would only allow for family reunifications if a refugee's initial one-year residency permit was renewed, a move heavily criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency and others.
4. Sweden offers strong social benefits for refugees
Asylum seekers are offered immediate emergency accommodation on arrival in Sweden before being relocated to temporary housing. Single adults are given a daily benefit of 71 Swedish kronor per day (2,159 kronor or $256 per month), with more available for those with families.
Those granted asylum are then given help finding accommodation, are entitled to free Swedish for Immigrants lessons and may also be offered an 'introduction benefit' from Arbetsförmedlingen, Sweden's Employment Agency, giving them an income of 6,468 Swedish kronor per month ($769) while they search for work.
Denmark also offers social benefits and free language lessons for immigrants. But while it is generally more expensive to live in Denmark than in Sweden, the Danish government has recently slashed the amount of so-called 'integration' money it gives to new arrivals by 45 percent to 5,945 Danish kroner ($891) for a a single adult with no children. This too was subject to criticism from the United Nations and humanitarian organizations.

5. Global reputation
Sweden has an international image of openness and tolerance. The current government is a Social Democrat-Green coalition which has spoken out strongly in favour of helping refugees. However it announced in October 2015 that pressure on resources meant that it could no longer guarantee accommodation for everyone. Meanwhile, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party is growing in popularity, but is not part of the government or the country's main centre-right opposition Alliance bloc.
By contrast, Denmark's new single-party government is led by the right-of-centre Venstre, which needs the support of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party to push its agendas through parliament.
The Danish government recently launched an information campaign in foreign newspapers to deter refugees from setting foot on Danish soil. Even the country's former centre-left government headed by Helle Thorning-Schmidt touted a hard-line approach to refugees and immigrants, a record that came back to haunt her on Wednesday when she was passed over for for the position of UN High Commissioner for Refugees."

					17:09 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,Denmark refuses to take in UN quota refugees in 2018,"Denmark said Thursday it would not take in any refugees under the UN's quota system in 2018, focusing instead on integrating those recently arrived in the country.
In 2016, the Scandinavian country suspended its participation in the UN refugee quota system, and has yet to resume it.
""We're still in a situation where we're struggling to integrate the many refugees who have come to Denmark in recent years,"" Immigration Minister Inger Støjberg said in a statement.
So-called UN ""quota refugees"" are offered resettlement in a third country if the country where they first register as refugees cannot accommodate them.
A member of the liberal Venstre party in Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen's conservative coalition government, Støjberg has orchestrated Denmark's immigration policy since 2015.
""While an increasing number of refugees have entered the labour market, there are still too many who cannot support themselves,"" she said.
The country registered 3,500 asylum seekers in 2017, according to the ministry, the lowest number since 2008.
For the first 10 months of 2018, some 2,600 applications have been received.
A new immigration law adopted at the end of 2017 stipulates that the number of refugees received is to be decided by the immigration ministry.

					10:00 CEST+02:00				",Michael Barrett,Pione Sisto: Danish World Cup hope who outgrew role of refugee-turned-matchwinner,"Celta Vigo winger Pione Sisto's lively pace and skill could be a ket asset for Denmark at this summer's World Cup. Sisto’s breakthrough was an exciting side plot in qualification as the country reached only its third major finals since 2004.
On June 17th, 2015, then-20-year-old Pione Sisto, a youth product with Danish Superliga side FC Midtjylland, scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win for Denmark’s Under-21 side against the Czech Republic in Prague.
The victory in the opening match of the U21 European Championships was hardly front page news, even in Denmark. But it made the front of one newspaper, and in some style.
“Today I’m a Danish Matchwinner: Once, I was a Refugee”: proclaimed the sports section of tabloid Ekstra Bladet, which was, up to that point, not known as a champion of positive stories about refugees.
The second clause of the headline was written as a hashtag, reading as #EngangVarJegFlygtning in Danish. The hashtag had been trending on social media in the run-up to that year's general election.
With immigration, as it often is, a key topic in election campaigning, many people were using the tag to highlight their personal success stories since arriving in Denmark as refugees.
After the youngster's winning goal for the under-21s, Ekstra Bladet’s headline shot the hashtag – and the catchphrase – into the stratosphere, making Sisto a household name in the process.

“It is not a political statement, merely two factual statements. The matchwinner and his background as a refugee along with his family. If some people interpret it politically, well, let them. Sport and politics are and always will be inseparable. It’s bloody naïve to think anything else,” Ekstra Bladet’s sports editor Allan Olsen wrote subsequently.
Sisto was indeed once a refugee. Born to South Sudanese parents in Uganda, he arrived in Denmark at the age of two months. He received Danish citizenship in 2014 – just a year before his goal in Prague.
But the winger’s career arc and performances since Ekstra Bladet’s inspired 2015 headline have ensured that his sporting reputation is no longer defined by his former political status.
A tricky dribbler blessed with lightning pace, he became a regular in the FC Midtjylland first team in the 2012-13 season. Sisto moved – 112 appearances and 28 goals later – to La Liga side Celta in July 2016.
The move to Spain came at the end of a campaign in which he scored twice for Midtjylland against Manchester United in the Europa League, including a memorable dribble and strike from the edge of the box in the home match.

He had already graduated from the U21 to the full national side, having made his debut under former manager Morten Olsen the previous year. Olsen’s successor, Norwegian coach Åge Hareide, then put his faith in Pione at international level as the nitty gritty of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup got underway.
He has now started every game for the Danish national team since October 2016. The Red and Whites successfully qualified for the finals in Russia after hammering Ireland in a play-off match. Sisto scored his first goal for his country in a friendly against Panama at Brøndby Stadium in March.

Meanwhile, his assists statistics for Celta reached such high levels that, at one point earlier this season, he trailed only one player – Manchester City’s David Silva – in the charts for the whole of Europe, earning himself the nickname ‘Pione Asisto’.
“I have always known I have an eye for my teammates, even though I also like dribbling. I’ve been good at assisting recently,” he told broadcaster DR at the time.
Hareide has said that the player has improved dramatically since his move to Spain and has the ability to be the difference at the World Cup.
Denmark's first match in Russia is against Peru in Saransk on June 16th before a clash with Australia in Samara five days later. They travel to Moscow to face France in their final group game on June 26th.
“Sisto has developed his play incredibly at Celta Vigo. Especially in his defensive work, where he has been fantastic for us in recent games,” the coach said to DR during the qualifying campaign.
But the young attacker seems to trust his attacking ability as much as anyone.
“There’s a big difference between dribbling when you have confidence and when you don’t. I have much more self-confidence now than I have last season. That makes a big difference as to whether the things I try come off,” he said in October last year.
Danish fans will be hoping that confidence is one of the features of this year’s World Cup finals. If it is, Sisto could well be on front pages again, this time for his matchwinning ability alone.

Shortly after the government announced in July that it would significantly cut benefits to asylum seekers, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said that she would make sure that asylum seekers and human smugglers were directly informed of the policy change through advertising and social media campaigns.
On Monday, the first adverts from the Danish government were published in four Lebanese newspapers.
An English-language version, published in Lebanon's The Daily Star, informs readers that “Denmark has decided to tighten the regulations concerning refugees in a number of areas.”

Støjberg’s ‘scare campaign’ has been highly controversial, even leading to criticism from within her own Venstre party. On Monday, Venstre MEP Jens Rohde accused his party cohort of making a political show for the gallery.

“One wishes that our minister – before she sets a bunch of things in action and appears on TV thumping her chest about how strong she is – would do some field studies so she could actually see what the conditions are like in Syria, Libya, Greece and the refugee camps,” he told Jyllands-Posten.
Migration experts have also cast doubt on the effectiveness of the ads, which cost the Ministry for Immigration, Integration and Housing some 252,000 kroner ($37,650).
""As the refugee pressure looks in Europe right now, I don't think one will redirect many by giving out this kind of information,"" Ninna Nyberg Sørensen, a migration researchers at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told Jyllands-Posten.

Støjberg took to Facebook to defend the ads.
""Today I have, as promised, published advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers informing about the changed conditions for people who apply for asylum in Denmark,"" she wrote.
She said the text would also be placed in asylum centres in Denmark in ten different languages and spread on social media.
""The aim is to inform objectively and soberly about [Danish rules], which the government is in the process of tightening,"" she added. ""In light of the huge influx to Europe these days, there is good reason for us to tighten rules and get that effectively communicated.""
Her Facebook post garnered over 5,000 likes, though some left critical comments.
""You should be ashamed,"" wrote user Dorthe Agertoug from the southeastern town of Køge.
""One of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes in recent times and our government's answer is to publish advertisements. It's a parody,"" added Vivi Ravnskjaer Terp in the southwestern town of Vojens.
A spokeswoman for Denmark's integration ministry denied a report that five major newspapers in Turkey had refused to carry the adverts.
A privately-funded campaign purchased advertisements in the UK paper The Guardian and a Germany newspaper last month to counter the government’s own ads. Those ads told refugees that “we welcome you to Denmark” and accused Støjberg of acting on “the ill-conceived and erroneous logic that families calculate where they may profit the most from settling as refugees”.
The government’s campaign has been published in ten different languages on DIS’s website and according to Jyllands-Posten, flyers in all ten languages have also been posted in asylum centres across Denmark. The Arabic text is also reportedly being circulated widely through social media.

Støjberg spent part of Thursday at the Aarhus software company CloudPartners, where two refugees have become the first to have successfully completed the two-year ‘basic integration education programme' (integrationsgrunduddannelse, IGU).
Launched in 2016 as an effort “to bring more refugees close to the labour market”, those on the IGU scheme are paid a salary of 50 to 120 kroner (€6.70 to €16) an hour for up to two years. The refugees also take part in skill development or education courses of up to 20 weeks.
The IGU programme is currently scheduled to expire next summer, but Støjberg said she wants to see it extended.

“I’m of the opinion that as long as refugees are in Denmark, they should provide for themselves,” she said. “And when we have some very strict demands on those refugees who come here, we must also give them the opportunity to actually enter the labour market. IGU is a very good option.”
Over 1,500 refugees have signed up for the programme and the two CloudPartners employees are the first of many who are expected to complete it in the coming weeks and months. But the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) is not impressed and believes that IGU should be abolished or restricted.
""We don’t think it works. It has been a stunt meant to show that integration will succeed, just like 20-plus other integration plans,” DF spokesman Martin Henriksen said.

Støjberg disagreed, saying that the programme has been effective.
""We can see that all the actions we have taken have resulted in far more refugees and their family members being a part of the labour market than they were before. Thus I believe that IGU and the other schemes have been successful in getting more refugees to support themselves,"" she said.
Støjberg stressed however that completing the IGU programme does not guarantee refugees or their families the right to permanently remain in Denmark.
“The refugees must return home when there is no longer any need for our protection. But as long as they are here, they must support themselves and not burden society,” she said.
There are currently 1,616 IGU participants spread across 999 companies in 94 municipalities. Just over half of the participants are from Syria. The courses are mainly in public administration, retail, transport and freight management."

The party’s deputy chairperson Anders Vistisen said that he supported leaving the arrangement if it obliged Denmark to accept refugees.
“If the Dublin Regulation stipulates taking in quota refugees then there is no longer rationale for Denmark to take part,” Vistisen said.
Mandatory quota refugees are included in a proposal to update the regulation accepted by the EU Parliament’s citizens’ rights committee, reports Ritzau.
Due to an opt-out clause between itself and the EU, Denmark is not currently covered by the union's quota for relocation of refugees.
But the Scandinavian country is a part of the Dublin Regulation, which states that refugees must be processed in the first EU country they reach.
The EU Commission has proposed that refugees are redistributed automatically between EU countries if some member states receive significantly more than their quota stipulates.
Having voted in favour of the proposal European Parliament must now agree on a compromise with the EU’s council of ministers over an exact procedure to be adopted by member states.
“If the Dublin Regulation is to be changed, Denmark must decide whether we take the new Regulation or withdraw,” Vistisen said.
“The Dublin system doesn’t work anyway. We cannot return refugees to countries the treat them badly,” he added.
“We can only deport 800-900 people under the Dublin system, according to new government figures. If we are also to take part in the EU’s relocation circus then there is no reason to take part,” Vistisen continued.
The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland also want to opt out of accepting a mandatory minimum number of refugees.

					13:36 CET+01:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Denmark extends block on UN quota refugees,"Denmark’s minister for immigration Inger Støjberg has announced a continuation of the government’s policy not to accommodate UN-stipulated quota refugees.
A parliamentary majority including the opposition Social Democrats – but without the populist Danish People’s Party – supports Støjberg’s law proposal, which would see Denmark refuse 500 UN quota refugees in 2018, a continuation of the country’s policy in 2016 and 2017.
Lawmakers in Denmark's parliament began on Tuesday the process of passing a law which would continue the policy of not accepting UN quota refugees.
The proposal has been criticised for adding pressure on countries bordering conflict areas, including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, which already accommodate large numbers of refugees.
The UN has encouraged EU countries, including Denmark, to ease the burden on countries such as these by accepting its quota for relocation.
The quota system enables the UN to relocate refugees whose needs cannot be met in countries that neighbour the conflicts they have fled from.
This might include refugees needing special protection, torture victims, unaccompanied women or children with rare illnesses.
Denmark is currently the only UN country currently refusing to accept quota refugees, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
“We have paused [the UN quota refugee programme] because we need to be able to keep up. We simply need breathing space,” Støjberg said on Tuesday.
The minister denied that asylum seeker figures in Denmark, which are now at their lowest lever for nine years, constituted that ‘breathing space’.
“We have a very, very low refugee flow to Denmark. We have not seen a lower number in the last nine years, so there is no doubt that the [immigration] curbs we have introduced have worked,” she said.
“But there are still too few providing for themselves. So that is one of the relevant factors,” she added.
The minister added that the issue of taking in UN quota refugees would be reassessed by the government “year by year”.
She also said that a successor to her post in any future left-wing government would not be able change Denmark’s position on quota refugees without first “asking parliament”.
That aspect of the proposal was the basis for the lack of support for the motion from anti-immigration Danish People’s Party, said Martin Henriksen, the immigration spokesperson for that party.
“The proposed law leaves a number of interpretations possible,” Henriksen said.
Henriksen’s opposite number in the Social Democrats – who voted in favour of Støjberg’s proposal not to accommodate quota refugees – said that a future government led by his party could consider reversing the decision.
“A Social Democrat government could well take in quota refugees. That also forms part of the proposal: that any minister can assess it,” Mattias Tesfaye told newspaper Politiken.
Tesfaye added that the extended refusal to take in quota refugees was a “temporary measure, that we have supported this year and next year.”
The MP also told the newspaper that his position was not in conflict with party leader Mette Fredriksen’s previous statements confirming that her party would not seek to relax immigration laws should it lead the government after the next election.

The issue is one of a number to be discussed by government leaders in meetings in the Belgian capital on Thursday and Friday.
Rasmussen is set to speak about a project, already discussed by Denmark and Austria, to establish an expulsion centre for rejected asylum seekers in an “unattractive location outside of the EU”.
The PM wants more countries to support his idea, which has so-far only received the backing of Austria's nationalist populist government, but said it could become a reality regardless.
“What is needed is for someone to take a new path, and Denmark has always done that in foreign policy,” he said to Ritzau.
“I will not hide that I would like to have more (governments) on board. But it is not something that will prevent us from being able to do it alone,” he added.
After announcing the idea in a Constitution Day speech earlier this month, Rasmussen said that Germany and the Netherlands, as well as Austria, were amongst the countries discussing the plan with Denmark.
But Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and the German interior ministry both said they were not aware of any specific proposal, Jyllands-Posten reported.
Albania's prime minister Edi Rama told German newspaper Bild that his country would “never accept this kind of EU refugee camp”.
Rama added that he was against the idea of ""offloading desperate people some place or other, like toxic waste no-one wants"".
Rasmussen said on Thursday that the proposed expulsion centre, which could potentially replace facilities in Denmark such as the controversial Departure Centre Kærshovedgård, would aim to “stop some migrants from showing up in the first place.”
“This is about managing a situation in which someone arrives in an EU country but has no right to asylum and must therefore be sent home.
“They would then be transferred to such a centre,” he said.

""It will give the municipalities a little breathing space and room to better take care of those who have already come here,"" Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told a meeting in the Danish parliament.
Støjberg, an immigration hardliner, said in August that the reception of 491 refugees through the programme this year had been postponed.
The decision to suspend the programme indefinitely had been taken so that Denmark could cope ""economically, socially and culturally,"" she said.
The centre-right minority government's move was backed by the anti-immigration Danish People's Party as well as the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats.
Denmark, which has a population of around 5.7 million, has received around 5,700 asylum seekers so far this year, and expects the annual number to be less than half of the 21,000 applications it received last year.
In 2015 an influx of migrants led to chaotic scenes with hundreds of people marching on Danish motorways -- most trying to reach neighbouring Sweden, which has more generous asylum rules.
Copenhagen enacted a host of measures to deter migrants from coming to the country earlier this year, including a controversial rule allowing police to confiscate their valuables to help pay for their accommodation.
It has also introduced legislation to allow it to turn back asylum seekers at its borders if the number of migrants spikes, and has made it harder for migrants to obtain permanent residency."

The party’s chairman, Daniel Carlsen, said the spray is a necessary legal alternative to pepper spray, which is illegal in Denmark.

He said that Haderslev was the perfect location to hand out the cans, given the reports of local women being harassed by refugees and asylum seekers.
“I don’t think it is provocative. We are tackling an actual problem in our society, where many Danes feel unsafe. Partially because there are so many migrants in the country and partly because one isn’t allowed to defend one’s self,” he told TV Syd.

One woman interviewed by TV Syd said she “can’t even find the words to describe how outraged” she was by the spray.
“I think it is disgusting. I’m simply so offended,” local resident Helle Byg said.
Another woman, Charlotte Bech, was overcome by emotion and gave a tearful interview to the TV station.
“They've been through so much and then they're told that they are so undesirable that we had to make a spray to use on them. One thing is the opinion that we don’t have the capacity [for refugees] or an opinion that some of them might not fit in to our culture.

Earlier this year it was behind an advertising campaign featuring the white silhouettes of playing children with the slogan “Your children deserve a Danish Denmark.""
A few months later, it tried to piggyback on the popularity of the Icelandic football team by posting a racist image to Facebook insinuating that France’s national team should not be allowed in the Euro 2016 tournament because of the African heritage of its players.
The Football Association of Iceland released a statement slamming the ad, which cautioned that “Europe and Denmark [will] be transformed into an African backyard”.

The problem doesn't seem to be contained to the Thisted tent camp. Nightclubs in the southern Jutland towns of Sønderborg and Haderslev have also reported that some asylum seekers harass female guests.
“We must say that a large number of the male guests who come from the local asylum centre have a very hard time respecting the opposite sex. In my eyes, it is harassment when one or more men continue to touch a young woman after she has said ‘stop',” Glenn Hollender from the Sønderborg club Den Flyvende Hollænder told TV Syd.
Rafi Ibrahim, a Syrian who has lived in Denmark for years, said that in Hadserslev the city's new refugees and asylum centres “don't know the rules” about how to behave around Danish women.
“If they see a girl, they go nuts. They simply can't handle it. The try to grab ahold of the girl's clothes or paw her,” he told TV Syd.
Ibrahim said that there simply is a marked difference between the newcomers' view of women and what is the norm in Denmark.
“In Syria and many other countries, it is not normal for a strange woman to smile at you. Those girls who are harassed aren't necessarily scantily-dressed or drunk. Some times it is enough just to be a girl,” he said."

Kristian Thulesen Dahl, the leader of the Danish People’s Party (DF), said in an interview with Berlingske that his party is open to the possibility of Denmark accepting more refugees as Europe struggles with what he called “maybe the biggest overall crisis since World War 2”.
Dahl said there needs to be a “national compromise” that would involve Denmark bringing in more refugees but with the clear intention of sending them back out of the country as soon as possible.
“If we were ensured that we are only helping refugees with temporary protection in Denmark, then we would be much more positive towards more coming to Denmark. That is something we are ready to accept,” Dahl told Berlingske on Wednesday.
Whereas DF has earlier said that Denmark should accept no refugees at all, the party now suggests establishing state-run centres throughout the country that would house refugees until they can be sent to their home countries again.
Dahl acknowledged that the centres could house refugees for many years, but “it would be worth it” if it minimized other societal problems.
“You can’t have your cake and eat it too. We must make the landmark decision that we don’t want to move the refugees here for life,” he said.
Party cohort Søren Espersen followed his DF boss’s suggestion with a recommendation for the perfect place to establish a large refugee centre: Greenland.
Espersen said that the former Navy station Grønnedal in southern Greenland should be converted into a state-run facility.
“This is completely perfect because it was abandoned a year and a half ago and is in tip-top condition. It has everything one can dream of, with health clinics and teaching locales. Up to 300 people could live there and on top of that it is in one of Greenland’s most beautiful areas,” Espersen told political site Altinget."

A rule previously imposed by the Danish government, preventing refugees given so-called ‘temporary’ asylum in Denmark from applying for family reunification for three years, means Denmark is ahead of its neighbour in keeping down numbers of refugee families in the country, the PM said.
In a painstakingly-negotiated coalition deal, Germany’s governing parties have agreed that no more than 1,000 people per month can enter the country under family reunification, with only immediate relatives eligible.

But Denmark is not in a position of having to limit numbers, Rasmussen said in parliament during a Prime Minister's question time exchange with Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF).
“The Germans are in a tricky place now. Because they didn’t get [the situation] under control in time. We have,” Rasmussen said.
“I am pleased we are not in the same situation as Germany,” he added.
The PM said he will take a closer look at the German proposal over the issue once it has been finalised and would discuss its potential consequences with DF.
“I am interested in seeing the German legal argument,” Rasmussen said.
Dahl has said that Denmark should follow Germany’s example and implement a limit, should Berlin pass the proposal.
But legal precedence in Denmark would make that step difficult in the Scandinavian country, according to Rasmussen.
The number of refugees taken in by Denmark constitutes a tiny fraction of those offered protection by Germany.
Denmark has taken in 31,000 refugees over three years, while the equivalent figure in Germany is 1.4 million, Rasmussen said.
“That is because we have this under control. Because we, along with the Danish People’s Party, have tightened things up,” he said.
“We have such good control over refugee arrivals that we do not expect more than 1,500 to maximum 3,000 family reunifications over the next three years. That is a good match for the level we would have if Denmark had a ‘German’ limit.
“So why explore the limits of conventions and supreme court decisions when this is unnecessary?”, he added.

The figures come from the country’s Ministry of Immigration and Integration (Udlændinge- og Integrationsministeriet).
During 2015 and 2016, the years in which refugee flow is considered to have peaked, 14,792 and 21,316 people respectively sought asylum in Denmark.
Immigration minister Inger Støjberg said that immigration curbs imposed by the government since 2015 have contributed to the fall in asylum seeker numbers. 67 such restrictions have been implemented since 2015.
“I am in no doubt that our strict line on immigration has become known well outside of our borders, and that is exactly the effect I wanted,” Støjberg said in the press statement that accompanied the figures.
“I have never been in doubt that refugees differentiate between what welfare goods they can get in different European countries, and the government has now put a stop to the Danish gift shop,” the minister added.
Migration experts have previously cast doubts on the effectiveness of measures such as 2015’s publication of details of Denmark’s newly-tightened asylum rules in Lebanese newspapers.
Refugees in Denmark have also said in the past that strict asylum rules were not their primary consideration when fleeing to join relatives already in the country.
Nordic neighbour Sweden reported last year a drop in asylum applications after it tightened its own policies on the issue, including the introduction of border controls in the south of the country and temporary residence permits for those offered protection, instead of permanent permits as had previously been the case.
In addition to curbs introduced to Denmark’s immigration laws, including 2016’s controversial jewellery law, the EU’s agreement with Turkey the same year, which effectively closed the Balkan migration route, is also responsible for the reduced asylum, Støjberg said.
In accordance with that agreement, migrants and refugees who arrived in Greece from Turkey after March 20th 2016 who are considered not to require protection are sent back to Turkey.
For every Syrian citizen sent back to Turkey, another must be relocated from a Turkish camp to an EU country, under the terms of the agreement.
“I hope that we will receive very few refugees in the coming years. The best thing is to help refugees in neighbouring countries, before they begin on often life-threatening journeys,” Støjberg said.
In a report on durable solution for Syrian refugees published in October 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) wrote that the “key durable solutions for refugees from Syria are resettlement and complementary pathways of admission to a third country, voluntary return to Syria in safety and dignity, and protection and assistance in countries of asylum.”
As of September 2017, there were 5.2 million Syria refugees hosted in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, according to that report. In Lebanon, one in five people is a refugee.
In total, 3,458 people applied for asylum in Denmark in 2017. 35 percent of asylum cases processed in 2017 resulted in asylum being granted, according to the most recent review dating from November, reports news agency Ritzau.

The UN’s high commissioner has called for Denmark to resume accepting its quota of relocated refugees, with asylum applications in the Scandinavian country at a record low.
But the country’s two biggest political parties, the Venstre (Liberal) Party, which is the senior partner in the coalition government, and the opposition Social Democrats say that it is too early for Denmark to accept refugees relocated to it by the UN, writes Politiken.
“Since 2015, the number of asylum seekers in Denmark has fallen dramatically. This year only approximately 2,000 new asylum seekers have come to Denmark. This would be a very good time for Denmark to resume accepting quota refugees,” Melissa Fleming, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told Politiken.
The quota system enables the UN to relocate refugees whose needs cannot be met in countries that neighbour the conflicts they have fled from.
This might include refugees needing special protection, torture victims, unaccompanied women or children with rare illnesses.
The UN is currently able to relocate one percent of its registered refugees, although as many as ten percent actually need to be relocated, according to Politiken’s report.
Denmark has accepted 500 of the UN’s quota refugees annually since 1989 – until last year, when it suspended its participation in the programme. Several other countries have also stopped accepting or reduced quota refugees.
Marcus Knuth, immigration spokesperson with Venstre, told Politiken that Denmark could resume taking in quota refugees in future.
“But we need to look further ahead. We have big integration problems with the large number that came in 2015,” he said.
The Social Democrats also dismissed immediate recommencement of quota refugee arrivals.
“We are not against taking in quota refugees. On the contrary, all refugees should come to Denmark via that system,” MP Dan Jørgensen told Politiken.
“We would prefer the EU to control its outer borders, so we can stop the terrible trafficking by people smugglers over the Mediterranean. Then we would be about to take in a number from the UN system,” he said.

A construction site that was destined to become home to 25 refugees was damaged by arson over the weekend.
Dragør Council is overseeing construction of the new refugee homes and said that its project was targeted by unknown perpetrators.
“We are currently establishing water, sewer and electrical connections to the pavilions. But there has been vandalism. Petrol was poured into the pipes and over the electrical installations and then set ablaze,” Dragør Mayor Eik Bidstrup told broadcaster DR.
The council has reported the incident to the police but at this point can’t say if the site was vandalized specifically because it will house refugees.
“If it is politically motivated, that is deeply troubling. The refugees are coming and we need to help them and take care of them. This will only affect taxpayers because it will end up costing extra money,” Bidstrup said.
Bidstrup said that there have been no previous reports of refugees being harassed in Dragør Council, which is located south of Copenhagen Airport on the island of Amager.
In August, a 26-year-old man was arrested for allegedly setting fire to an asylum centre minibus in Jutland and vandalizing its garage with a swastika and a message telling the centre that this was its “first warning”. Around 2,000 people from the local community later came out to support the centre’s residents.
While attacks on Danish refugee centres have been rare, the problem has been raging in Germany for months. Just this week, several fires were set in and around refugee homes in at least four separate German districts.

A decade’s worth of efforts to integrate refugees into the Danish labour market have failed, a new analysis from the Confederation of Danish Employers (Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening - DA) shows.
Berlingske newspaper crunched the numbers from a DA investigation and found that just one out of every four refugees who came to Denmark between 2000-2003 was employed ten years later.
The head of DA said the Danish government has “truly failed” in its efforts to get refugees working.
“It is catastrophic that we are so bad at integrating refugees into the Danish job market. That is not acceptable for our refugees, and as a society we simply cannot afford to let this group be taken care of by public benefits,” Jørn Neergaard Larsen told Berlingske.
Government officials acknowledged the problem, with Employment Minister Henrik Dam Kristensen calling the findings “deeply frightening” and Economy Minister Morten Østergaard saying the figures were “an admission of failure”.
DA’s Larsen placed the lion’s share of blame on municipalities that aren’t good enough at helping refugees into the job market. He told Berlingske that without the local authorities’ guiding hand, refugees too often end up on public benefits instead of in a job.
“It’s deeply troubling that we have the world’s most lucrative cash welfare system. If we made a larger distance between the welfare benefits and low-paying jobs, it would of course be easier for the municipalities to convince the refugees that having a job is better than being an outsider,” he said.
Andreas Kamm, the general secretary of the Danish Refugee Council, agreed that not enough has been done to integrate refugees properly into Danish society and the national labour market.
“No one comes here with the idea that they won’t have to work. They are used to fighting for their very existence, also when they are on the run,” Kamm told Ritzau.
Kamm said that the refugees need more help making sense of Denmark’s complicated and generous welfare system.
DA’s investigation looked into how many of the 7,700 refugees who came to Denmark between 2000-2003 were employed between 2010-2013.
The figures come at a time when more and more asylum seekers are flocking to Denmark. The 14,815 people who sought asylum in Denmark in 2014 was nearly double the number from the year before and an almost fourfold increase from 2009.
Those numbers fell drastically in January due to the implementation of new restrictions aimed at both Syrians and Eritreans."

As part of ‘fundamental changes' to Denmark's approach to asylum wanted by the right-wing party in exchange for its support of the government's tax cut proposals, DF wants the ‘basic integration education programme' (integrationsgrunduddannelse, IGU) to be cut from immigration provisions.
Introduced by minister Inger Støjberg's Ministry of Immigration and Integration in 2016, the IGU initiative provides opportunities for refugees to take short-term jobs at an apprentice salary level of between 50 to 120 kroner (6.70--16 euros) per hour.
The IGU jobs can last for up to two years and refugees are offered skill development or education courses of up to 20 weeks.
In what it has called a ‘paradigm shift' on immigration, DF has proposed all refugees granted so-called temporary asylum (midlertidigt ophold in Danish) be denied the right to family reunification and returned to their home country once it is considered to be safe, as well as for IGU to be scrapped.
Those policies fall into line with the DF view that the status of refugees should always be considered as temporary.
Newspaper Politiken reported on Monday that the IGU scheme offered considerable economic benefit for Denmark's 92 municipalities.
Figures provided to the Ministry of Immigration and Integration by consultancy firm Mploy demonstrate the potential windfall for authorities, writes Politiken.
In Aalborg Municipality, where the economic potential was found to be greatest, the city council stands to save 100 million kroner (13.4 million euros) if 100 refugees receive income through IGU rather than the state income payment for refugees (integrationsydelse in Danish).
In addition to savings on welfare payments, the municipality would also receive a results-based bonus from the state should refugees complete six months in IGU apprenticeships.
At least 34 refugees are currently engaged in such programmes in Aalborg, reports Politiken.
“We have had good experiences with the IGU, and it is – as these analyses show – a very economically viable option,” Confederation of Danish Employers director Jacob Holbraad told the newspaper.
The full potential of the scheme for individual municipalities depends on the number of eligible refugees living there, but the average saving over a two-year-period could be up to 5.5 million kroner (740,000 euros), according to the report.
Should the IGU programme result in a full-time job offer, those potential benefits stand to increase even further.
Although different employment schemes have different degrees of success, the IGU model is strong since private businesses are generally responsible for paying participants' wages, a labour analyst told Politiken.
“From the moment an individual who would otherwise be unemployed enters an IGU scheme, that person is contributing to providing for themselves. That is a positive economic story for the business, the individual and for the state, including the municipal coffers,” Torben Tranæs of the Danish Centre of Applied Social Science and the Danish Economic Councils said.
DF's immigration spokesperson Martin Henriksen told Politiken that, although his party would prefer refugees to provide for themselves, DF was also against IGU, since the scheme increased the likelihood of individuals remaining in the country in the long term.
He also said that discussion of economic benefits should take into account other municipal, regional and state costs of providing asylum.
“It would be very good for our country culturally and good economic business if people were sent back [to their home countries],” Henriksen said.

					14:27 CET+01:00				", The Local,Danish government wants to turn away child refugees at the border,"Denmark’s government wants to be able to block unaccompanied refugee children from entering the country if borders are closed due to exceptional circumstances.
Children could be turned away from the border without any assessment of their claims for asylum, should a proposal by the Danish government become reality.
The government’s proposal for the so-called ‘emergency brake’ (nødbremse) law, originally proposed in September 2016, would allow completely closed borders in an emergency situation.
In such a “crisis situation”, the EU’s Dublin Regulation would not apply, according to the proposal put forth by the government. What actually constitutes the crisis situation is yet to be fully clarified.
Integration minister Inger Støjberg has said that, had all other factors been identical, the ‘emergency brake’ would have been applied during the September 2015 influx of refugees which saw large groups walking along motorways in southern Denmark.
There had been doubt as to whether the emergency brake provision for closing borders, which has now reached the agenda for parliamentary voting, would include any provision for unaccompanied minors or whether they would be excluded from it.
While no statement on minors is included in the proposal itself, Politiken reports that the Ministry for Integration informed it in an email that “in principal, everyone will be turned away – including unaccompanied minors. There may be exceptions, however, for example if the parents are already in Denmark.”
Humanitarian organisations and opposition political groups have already voiced their outrage at the potential law change.
“If there are three children standing alone at the border, and we as a country say ‘tough luck’ – I think that is so small-minded that it almost can’t get any smaller,” Sofie Carsten Nielsen, deputy leader of the Social Liberal (Radikale Venstre) Party, told newspaper Politiken.
The proposal was scheduled to be brought up in parliament on Thursday.
1,184 unaccompanied children came to Denmark in 2016, according to government statistics. But many of those included in the figures were boys between 15 and 17 years old, according to Støjberg.
Støjberg said that should, for example, a 10-year-old girl present at the border, the emergency brake rules would also apply in this case.
“The fact of the matter is that if you come here as an unaccompanied minor then you have travelled through Germany and other countries, so you are not coming from an unsafe country,” Støjberg told Politiken.
Humanitarian organisations were also strongly critical of Støjberg’s position.
“When vulnerable refugee children come here after a dangerous journey, the last thing they need is an otherwise progressive and child-friendly country sending them away,” Save the Children Denmark’s general secretary Jonas Keiding Lindholm told the newspaper.
The largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said that it would be supporting the government proposal for the emergency brake law.
“I find it hard to imagine that we will not be supporting the final proposal,” said the party’s naturalisation spokesperson Mattias Tesfaye, according to Politiken.
Other critics of the proposal, including the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten), have called for Støjberg to explain how police officers will be able to make qualified assessments of children’s best interests when they present at the border – a task that does not lie within the police remit."

In a move already signalled earlier this week, Denmark has said it will not participate in the EU’s plans to resettle some 160,000 refugees.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg confirmed on Friday that Denmark will not be involved in the distribution of refugees amongst EU countries, a plan championed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday.

“We will not take part in the 160,000 asylum seekers that shall be distributed. We won’t do it because we have an opt-out [on EU Justice and Home Affairs, ed.] and because we are already taking in a great deal now,” Støjberg told Berlingske.
Støjberg said that Denmark’s decision should come as no surprise.
“We have an opt-out – it is very well-known that we won’t participate in the redistribution of these 160,000 so therefore I don’t think this is in any way something dramatic from a Danish viewpoint,” she said.
Speaking to Jyllands-Posten, Støjberg said that she saw “simply no reason” to take some of the asylum seekers since Denmark is already “taking absolutely a very large portion already”.
Denmark received more than 15,000 asylum requests in 2014. In relation to its population size, it was the fifth-biggest recipient in the EU, ahead of Germany, according to Eurostat.
According to a memo from the Ministry for Immigration, Integration and Housing obtained by Jyllands-Posten, Denmark could risk exclusion from the EU’s Dublin Regulation on asylum seekers if the nation does not agree to the redistribution plan. Støjberg however said she didn’t think the plan that Juncker put forth on Wednesday will be approved in its current form.
“If the proposal from the commission is implemented from one end to the other as it looks right now, then it is correct that we sooner or later will face a decision [on Denmark’s continued participation in the Dublin Regulation, ed.]. But I think it would be the first time in Europe’s history that such a major proposal would be but implemented from one end to the other,” she told Berlingske.
The integration minister stressed that Denmark strongly prefers to remain part of the regulation, which which states that the first EU nation to register an asylum seeker must process the claimant’s application.
Denmark is part of the Dublin rules despite its opt-out because it entered a so-called parallel agreement with the EU. According to the parallel agreement, Denmark will have to inform the EU if it intends to go along with changes to the regulation. If Danish officials don’t clarify the country’s stance within a given time period, Denmark’s parallel agreement is considered annulled.
Experts have warned that if Denmark does not go along with the EU plan and thus ends up excluded from the Dublin Regulation, the nation would become a prime destination for asylum seekers and human smugglers because Denmark would no longer have the option of sending people back to another European country.
Denmark's opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs makes the Nordic nation exempt from having to participate in a shared European approach to the current refugee crisis, even though joining a EU-wide solution could result in Denmark taking in fewer refugees than it does now.
Denmark will hold a referendum on ending its opt-out on December 3rd, but the new proposed ‘opt-in’ model would have no bearing on Denmark’s asylum and immigration policies."

What are the challenges in the interaction between having a job focus while also supplying Danish language education,” Employment Minister Jørn Neergaard Larsen told reporters after the tripartite negotiations on Friday.
Under the plan, Larsen said that local municipalities must focus exclusively on getting refugees into work, even at the expense of learning the Danish language.

Heading in to the negotiations, PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen had made it clear that getting refugees into the Danish labour force would be at the heart of three-party talks.
Denmark has had a poor track record of getting refugees into the labour market. A 2015 analysis from the Confederation of Danish Employers (Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening) showed that three out of four refugees who came to Denmark in the early 2000s were jobless ten years later.

Rasmussen told parliament earlier this month that there is a potential savings of 200 kroner per citizen every time a refugee finds work and leaves social welfare support and he warned that if Denmark’s refugee employment rates are not brought to the level of other non-Western immigrants, the national economy stands to lose 2.5 billion kroner ($300 million) in ""just a few years”.
The 21-point plan includes calls for better screening of refugees’ competencies, tying refugees’ housing opportunities to employment, and a “clear requirement that they [refugees] need to work and provide for themselves and their families”.
The plan also calls for Danish language courses to “supplement” the job focus and calls on the language courses to be modernized and made more relevant to the job market. Businesses that hire refugees are also given the opportunity to provide their own language lessons with financial support form the local municipality.

Nadim told broadcaster DR that she was aware that her achievements as a footballer could see her being perceived as a role model.
The striker said she was keen to do her best in the role.
“I think it’s a very big thing. I am very grateful to be able to inspire off the pitch. I never thought I’d be in that situation. But I think it’s great the people can see it and can use me as an example,” Nadim told the broadcaster from the training camp of Denmark’s Kvindelandsholdet (Women’s National Team) in the Netherlands.

					14:35 CET+01:00				", The Local,PM: Refugees in Denmark should work 'from day one',"Refugees must find work and be given jobs faster, Danish PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen said ahead of the tripartite negotiations with business and union representatives this week.
Getting refugees into the Danish labour force will be at the heart of three-party talks between the government, the labour unions and the employers’ association that get underway on Thursday.
PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that he wants to improve refugees' integration by getting them quickly into work.
""Since Europe’s borders were breached, we have found ourselves in an extraordinary situation,” Rasmussen said in parliament on Tuesday, as quoted by Information. “If we don’t solve it, it will worsen our chances of overcoming many other challenges.""
Rasmussen pointed to a potential savings of 200 kroner per citizen every time a refugee finds work and leaves social welfare support.
If refugee employment rates are not brought to the level of other non-Western immigrants, the Danish economy stands to lose 2.5 billion kroner ($300 million) in ""just a few years"", the PM claimed.
Some 25,000 refugees are expected to arrive in Denmark in 2016 with 17,000 of these eventually being transferred to municipality integration programmes, according to a press release by the Ministry of Employment.
In January, parliament passed tighter asylum regulations including allowing authorities to seize valuable items from refugees and increasing waiting times for family reunification to three years, provoking international criticism.
With the restrictions now in place, the government has tried to pivot toward getting those refugees who are already in Denmark to enter the labour market.
""Expected to work from day one""
“From now on, new arrivals will be expected to work from day one. This will be based on focusing on an effort to find work for everyone from the very start,” a government commission for the tripartite meetings is quoted as saying in a communication obtained by Politiken.
One measure the government aims to make use of is finding a model by which refugees can gradually be brought into employment even though they may not initially be able to work on the same basis as others. This includes making use of the so-called lower ‘apprentice wage’ (elevløn) and enabling refugees to work before they have passed Danish language exams.
“Training should be combined with existing opportunities for Danish lessons and other basic qualifications, supported by a better understanding for the job market,” says the commission statement, according to Politiken.
Last week, the Danish Chamber of Commerce (Dansk Ehrverv) said that it was open to the challenge of employing refugees who could not yet speak Danish, after Løkke stated that this was a potential area in which waiting times for placing refugees in work could be shortened.
“Only four out of ten [refugees] in Denmark are in work after ten years,” Stine Pilegaard, vice-director of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, told broadcaster DR. “So we think it is right to get them into work sooner, so they don’t lose motivation.

“Our experience shows that refugees learn Danish twice as quickly if they are working, compared to in a normal programme of language lessons,"" Pilegaard added.
'Introduction income' faces resistance
But it may be more difficult to convince unions to agree to lower-than-normal wages for refugees, even if this is a measure that might encourage businesses to employ them. Finance Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen met with opposition from employee and employee associations alike when mooting a similar idea, a so-called ‘introduction income’ (indslusningsløn) in January.
Opposition leader Mette Frederiksen of the Social Democrats criticised Rasmussen’s aims for the tripartite meetings as ""unambitious"". Frederiksen told DR that integration should not be the sole priority of the upcoming talks, but that the government commission should be focusing on other aspects of the job market, such as finding internship places for the young and improving working environments to avoid the risk of employees becoming ‘worn out.’
The government hopes to reach an agreement by Easter, enabling employers and unions to implement their parts of the deal by autumn 2017."

Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said on Thursday that she is prepared to run advertisements in foreign newspapers that will contain information aimed at deterring refugees from coming to Denmark.
The announcement was made shortly after Jyllands-Posten revealed the contents of a document that human smugglers use to help asylum seekers compare the different levels of benefits in Europe.

The document compares monthly waiting times for family reunification as well as the monetary amount of monthly benefits that are available to refugees in countries including Denmark, Germany and Sweden.
“There is something strange about the fact that a refugee would travel through several countries before ending up in Denmark, Norway, Sweden or Germany,” Støjberg told DR.
Støjberg said that the document vindicates the Venstre government's decision to cut benefits to asylum seekers by up to 45 percent shortly after taking power, which critics argued would do nothing to stem the flow of refugees. Now she wants to make sure that human smugglers and potential refugees get the message loud and clear.
“The ads will contain factual information on the halving of benefits as well as other restrictions that we will be enacting. That kind of information spreads very quickly,” Støjberg told DR.

The Danish People’s Party made a similar proposal last week, although instead of newspaper ads they wanted the government to launch a video campaign clearly telling refugees to stay away, akin to the one developed by the Australian government.
The proposal was heavily criticized however, leading Venstre spokesman Jakob Ellemann-Jensen to dismiss the idea as 'un-Danish'.
“I don’t think the Australian video is an example to replicate in Denmark. The video is a bit tough and I don’t think it is a Danish way to communicate. It’s fine if it works in Australia, but I can’t immediately see it being used in Denmark,” Ellemann-Jensen told Politiko.
Despite her party's criticism of the proposed video, Støjberg said that a newspaper campaign will be put in motion, although when and where is still in question.
“It could be in countries such as Turkey and other places that human smugglers keep an eye on,” Støjberg told DR.
The ultimate goal of the campaign is to spread to social media where such information can be rapidly disseminated.
Denmark saw its asylum numbers nearly double in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013. A report from the Danish Immigration Service last month showed that 2015 is on pace to be yet another record year.
Per capita, Denmark took in the sixth highest number of asylum applications in 2014. But due to its opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs, it is not participating in the European plan to redistribute refugees even though it could end up with Denmark taking in fewer numbers than it does now."

The Confederation of Danish Employers (Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening, DA) says the positive news can in part be put down to the tripartite agreement the government entered into with businesses and union representatives last year.
Under the agreement, a new so-called ‘basic integration education programme’ (integrationsgrunduddannelse, IGU), was introduced, aiming to put refugees in short-term jobs at an apprentice salary level of between 50 to 120 kroner ($7-$17) per hour.
The IGU jobs can last for up to two years and refugees are offered skill development or education courses of up to 20 weeks.
Asylum seekers cost the Danish state an average net total of 163,000 kroner ($23,000) per person in 2014, according to figures published by the Ministry of Finance on Monday.
But other numbers released by the report paint a more positive picture.
Refugees have come a long way as far as finding work in Denmark goes, with more people finding work more quickly in recent years, according to the figures.
“There are a lot of signs that things are going in the right direction. Refugees are more commonly making it on to the job market, finding employment, wage subsidised work and internships than before,” Berit Toft Fuhl, senior consultant with DA, told newspaper Dagbladet Information.
Much of the improvement in refugees’ employment prospects can be put down to the tripartite agreement, said DA.

Prior to the agreement, only three percent of refugees were considered available for immediate employment. Today, the figure stands at 60 percent, and DA expects it to continue to rise, reports the newspaper.
A significant number of refugees also found work with Danish businesses last year, according to Confederation of Danish Industry (Dansk Industri) figures, with 3,100 finding full-time employment between March and November last year – an increase of 75 percent.
Another positive development was in the area of welfare-supported internships (virksomhedspraktik), an oft-used intermediate step towards work in the Danish job market. Approximately 6,000 refugees are currently engaged in this type of employment activity with Danish businesses, reports Information.
The introduction of IGU has also helped almost 400 refugees into part-time work, according to the report.
Ministry of Finance figures in turn show that refugees are finding work sooner and that the number of asylum seekers is falling.
In 2015 – the peak year for asylum arrivals in the country – around ten percent of refugees on two-year asylum permits were in work. In 2016, this proportion had increased to 25 percent, according to Dagbladet Information.
“There are, as such, signs that those granted asylum are finding work faster than previously,” writes the ministry in its report, adding that “there is still some way to go to reach the government’s target, whereby half of all asylum seekers should be working three years after arrival in Denmark.”
The ministry also notes that there may be some difference between its own registration-based analysis and figures posted by the Ministry for Immigration.
The anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF) recognised the positive signs of the figures but maintained that immigration was a huge drain on the Danish economy.
“We did not support the tripartite agreement because of IGU and the right to social welfare, which is given on a flimsy basis, while others spend several years earning it. And if you look at the report overall then you can see that integration has failed. The bill will continue to increase for many years if we don’t limit the amount of people coming here,” DF party chairperson Peter Skaarup told Dagbladet Information."

In at least 23 municipalities, officials plan to place refugee children directly into the public school system even if they haven’t yet mastered the local language.
Broadcaster TV2 surveyed officials in Denmark’s 98 municipalities on their plans to educate refugee children. Of the 75 municipalities that responded, 23 of them said that refugee kids would be placed in normal classes rather than special introductory courses that have been offered in the past. A number of additional municipalities said that they are considering following course.
In most instances the school officials said that special language training and other initiatives would be available to the refugee children, but that hasn’t stopped the Danish Union of Teachers (Danmarks Lærerforening) from criticizing the plans.
“Under all circumstances, this will mean that a student who doesn’t speak Danish will require something extra and that will naturally take away from the other students,” the union’s deputy chair, Dorte Lange, told TV2.
Although his municipality told TV2 it would not be placing refugee children in normal classes this year, Aalborg Mayor Thomas Kastrup-Larsen said that mixing refugees with other Danish children as soon as possible is a wise strategic move.
“It is an investment that is made based on what will provide the best integration and the best school, while also proving to tbe the most effective in the long run,” he said.

Data published by the Danish Refugee Council shows that the number of people accepting the offer of 131,242 kroner ($19,451) has fallen from 261 in 2011 to 152 in 2015.
Now both government and opposition parties are looking into reforming the repatriation scheme, according to a report by Berlingske.
""It is possible that the 'carrot' offered to return home should be bigger, but the scheme is very generous as it is,"" Peter Kofod Poulsen, acting immigration spokesperson with the right wing Danish People's Party (DF) told Berlingske.
""Some countries should be pressed economically into taking back citizens who can easy return home when there is peace,"" Kofod continued.
The governing Venstre Party's acting political spokesperson Louise Schack Elholm also said that the effectivity of the scheme should be increased.
""We also want more people to return home,"" Elholm told Berlingske. ""We have suggested that the funds could be linked to state support for developing countries [diverting funds assigned for aid to developing countries to the scheme, ed.], and have not ruled anything out.""
Mattias Tesfaye, member of the opposition Social Democrats' immigration committee, said that information campaigns could be the key to improving the success of the scheme, adding that changes to they way it is funded may be necessary.
""We neither dismiss a discussion of the actual amount or the limit on existing fortunes that makes up part of the rules for the scheme,"" Tesfaye said to Berlingske.
""We are also open to discussing how to use state funds for developing countries to force other countries into taking back their citizens,"" said Tesfaye.
The number of people granted asylum in Denmark has increased significantly over the last five years, from a total of 2,249 people in 2011 to 10,849 today.
The Danish Refugee Council's statistics show that, of the 152 people that accepted the repatriation of in 2015, 53 were from Bosnia and Herzegovina. One Syrian citizen left Denmark under the scheme along with eight Iraqis - a huge drop from 87 in 2011.
Andreas Kamm, General Secretary of the Danish Refugee Council, told Berlingske that the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan made it unsafe for people from these countries to return home for the 'foreseeable future'.
Denmark would therefore be unable to withdraw asylum for individuals from these countries without breaking international conventions.
""I am often perceived as someone who fights for more and more refugees coming to Denmark and staying here forever. But my fundamental view is that refugees should be given protection for the entire period they need it. And that the ideal solution for most refugees is to be able to go home,"" said Kamm."

Denmark and the Netherlands are often seen as one and the same from abroad (if you don’t believe us, check out the first point in Vox’s recent primer on Denmark), and the Dutch comedy programme ‘Zondag met Lubach’ recently attempted to capitalize on that confusion by redirecting refugees to Denmark.
Sunday's episode of the satirical weekly news programme said that with the refugee crisis creating division within the Netherlands, the country can no longer guarantee the safety of refugees and asylum seekers.
“So to anyone coming our way, we have one clear message: Try Denmark!”, the video says, before extolling the virtues of the Danes.
See it here. Story continues below.
“Denmark’s population is highly intelligent. They all watch complicated Danish TV series without subtitles. Furthermore, people who have lived in Denmark for over five years automatically get their own internationally-acclaimed drama series”
The video, which can be seen as a response to Denmark’s own infamous message to would-be refugees, also wades in to a touchy area by bringing up the 2005 Mohammed Crisis spurred by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten’s publication of 12 caricatures of the prophet.

“Fun fact: Denmark has many cultural links to the Muslim world. For instance, the Prophet Mohammed was originally from a suburb of Copenhagen. This we know because the first drawings of the prophet were found here,” the narrator states.

""As a Dane, I approve of this message ^^ it's funny! Well played, Holland, well played!"" one YouTube user wrote.
""We deserve this for making those stupid ads in the first place,"" another wrote.
The video clip concludes with what could very well be a new national slogan for the Dutch.
“Come to Denmark: It’s the Netherlands, but somewhere else,” it states, before throwing in the bonus offer of Borgen box set for any refugees who “migrate within the next ten minutes”.

Carried out by Voxmeter on behalf of the Danish Red Cross, the survey shows that 9.4 per cent of Danes state that they would give money to refugees today compared to 4.5 per cent in 2016 and 2.3 per cent in 2013.
The results reflect a significant change in the attitudes of Danes towards helping others, according to the secretary general of the Danish Red Cross (DRC).
Anders Ladekarl, DRC's general secretary, told news agency Ritzau that Danes have become better at talking about solutions to the refugee issue and the consequences of not helping refugees.
“There's been a significant change in people's attitudes towards helping people. It's related to an increased understanding of the fact that it's important to help refugees,” Ladekarl told Ritzau.
“This also signals that even though many Danes are concerned that too many refugees are coming to Denmark, this does not necessarily mean they do not want to help,” the NGO general secretary continued.
Ladekarl told Ritzau that more people now wished to support refugees than animal welfare, and that the conflict in Syria, now entering its seventh year, had been the main eye-opener for Danes on the need to help refugees.
“That brutal war has made its victims seem very close at hand for a lot of people,” he said, adding that the massive focus on the issue by media and politicians had been a large factor in Danes' awareness of the seriousness of the issue.
The Danish arm of the Red Cross received 7.9 million kroner ($1.1 million) in donations to Syria in 2016 compared with 3.5 million ($0.5 million) kroner in 2013, reports Ritzau.

In a stunt that elicited strong emotions and attracted international attention, Carlsen took to the streets of Haderslev in southern Jutland to distribute over 100 cans of what he called ‘refugee spray’.
The cans actually contained hair spray but were relabelled as an “effective” and “legal” means for Danes to protect themselves from refugees and asylum seekers.
On Wednesday, South Jutland Police confirmed to TV Syd that a racism charge had been filed against Carlsen.
Carlsen, a former member of a Nazi party, said the police charge was “political theatre”.
“I think it is a very, very weak case. We handed out hairspray with a sticker on it so I doubt that anything at all comes out of the charges,” he told news agency Ritzau.
He added that the police likely acted on “political pressure” from parliament.
Carlsen said that the cans of ‘refugee spray’ were meant to help people feel safe in Haderslev, where a migrant centre currently houses around 140 asylum seekers, according to the Danish Red Cross.
Earlier this year, there were reports of local women being harassed by refugees and asylum seekers at the centre.
“There is a sense of insecurity, including in Haderslev, where we have experienced a rape committed by an asylum seeker and that is the insecurity that we are trying to do something about,” he told TV Syd while handing out the cans last month.
Denmark’s so-called ‘racism paragraph’ often leads to formal police complaints. Convictions, however, are somewhat rare. On Thursday, prosecutors said that no formal charges would be pursued against a Danish People's Party (DF) politician who was reported for racism after she said that foreigners ""cheat, they steal, they rape and they kill"".
Another DF politician Alex Ahrendtsen, was formally reported to police for racism on Monday over remarks he made about Muslims. He contended that the racism paragraph has become a political tool.
“People use the [racism] paragraph as a tool to shut the mouths of politicians and it is always rejected by the police,” he told TV2 over the summer.
Recent exemptions include a Danish People’s Party politician being convicted of racism for comparing Muslims to Hitler. A Lolland man who spit on refugees also recently accepted a 5,000 kroner fine to avoid his racism case going to court."

PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen, flanked by his integration and justice ministers, announced on Friday that his government will allow authorities to house refugees in tents, shorten refugees' residence permits and make them wait three years before bringing their family to Denmark.
Rasmussen introduced 34 initiatives spread across five main areas: changes to the conditions faced by asylum seekers, better options for sending rejected asylum seekers out of the country, new housing and detention options for immigration authorities, new possibilities for police to control the arrival of foreigners and relaxed requirements for municipalities in accommodating refugees. The full list of initiatives can be read here (in Danish).
Among the government’s plans is the establishment of tent camps to house some of the 13,000 asylum centres currently spread across 33 different municipalities.
To begin with, there will be tents erected in Thisted next week, which primarily house single male refugees.
“The Danish Immigration Service is working to find accommodation for the growing number of asylum seekers, including in the form of regular housing but also though the use of mattress solutions in schools, community centres, etc,” the government’s plan reads.
“Beyond that, there is work to establish a large number of extraordinary accommodation spaces at the Danish Emergency Management Agency’s (Beredskabsstyrelsen) centres and defence barracks as well as the erection of tents,” the plan continues.

Shorter permits, longer family reunification times
Rasmussen also announced plans to shorten the length of residence permits given to refugees. UN convention refugees will see their permits shortened from the current five years to three, while the residence permits for refugees granted regular protection status will drop from five years to two.
Those on the previously-introduced temporary residence scheme will still be granted one year permits but will only be able to renew them for one year at a time instead of the current two years.
Among the government’s other plans is to further delay the ability of refugees to bring their families to Denmark under the family reunification scheme. The previous Social Democrat-led government had already implemented a one-year waiting period, but Rasmussen’s cabinet wants to extend it to three years.
In announcing the new measures, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said that the number of refugees in Denmark “challenges our immigration authorities, our municipalities and our society in general”.
The further tightening of Denmark’s asylum policies are thus designed to make the country a less desirable destination.
“Denmark should not be a magnet for asylum seekers,” she said.
In a Wednesday press conference previewing the coming changes, Rasmussen said that Denmark planned to take its asylum policies ""to the edge of international law"".
On Friday, he said that he was confident that the new measures would not violate international conventions, even though the UN Refugee Agency and others have sharply criticized the existing one-year waiting period for family reunification.
""It is definitely our believe that this is in accordance with international conventions. We have worked with this question for a long time and believe that what we are presenting today respects our international obligations,"" Rasmussen said.
Justice Minister Søren Pind said the three-year waiting period for family reunification is “tenable and within the European Convention on Human Rights”.
The extended waiting period for family reunification applies to those refugees who have been granted temporary residence as part of the scheme introduced last year for refugees fleeing the civil wars like the one in Syria.
The government's new plan comes after Denmark experienced an all-time single-month high for refugees in October, when an estimated 3,500 sought asylum. Figures from the Danish National Police also showed that at least 10,900 people crossed into Denmark between November 2nd-9th. The number is significantly higher than the 3,500 to 6,000 who have arrived in recent weeks.
However, the vast majority of those refugees were just passing through to elsewhere, primarily to Sweden, which received more asylum applications last week than Denmark did through the first nine months of 2015.
Rasmussen has said that Denmark has no plans to implement border controls following Sweden's decision to do so."

Denmark’s minister for employment has called the figures an “incredible development”, reports the Berlingske newspaper.
The figure represents a considerable increase in the number of refugees finding work, according to the report.
According to Ministry of Employment figures quoted by Berlingske, the percentage of people in employment within three years of coming to Denmark as refugees or under family reunification rules stood at 12 percent in June 2015.
By June 2017, that figure had increased to thirty percent.
The ministry bases its figures on those in what is considered ‘normal’ employment – in other words, jobs that are not supplemented by state support.
Minister for Emloyment Troels Lund Poulsen told Berlingske that the apparently substantial increase in the amount of refugees in work represented a “paradigm shift”.
“Even though the starting point was low, this is amazing and an incredible development in a short space of time,” Poulsen said.
The minister added that he believed the government target of a 50 percent employment rate for newly-arrived refugees – those that have been in the country for three years or less – by 2020 was achievable.
According to Poulsen, one reason for the dramatic increase is a focus on what refugees have to offer Danish society.

Torben Tranæs, head of research with the Danish Centre of Applied Social Science (Det Nationale Forsknings- og Analysecenter for Velfærd), told Berlingske that a new approach by municipalities, as well as generally high employment rates, had contributed to the positive figures.
Berit Toft Bihl, head consultant with the Confederation of Danish Employers (Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening), told news agency Ritzau that she also considered the news positive, but that there was still much work to be done.
“We’ve made a good start, but we also had a low starting point, so we still need to work hard to make the numbers rise,” she said.

The refugee tent camps that were established in November 2015 as Denmark faced an influx of migrants and asylum seekers will be phased out by the end of the month, DIS said.
The agency plans to close a total of 4,800 migrant accommodations, including the tent camps operated by the Danish Emergency Management Agency (Beredskabsstyrelsen - DEMA).
DIS said that 2,800 of the accommodations would be closed permanently while the other 2,000 would remain available if refugee numbers suddenly picked up again.
The tent camps are being closed because Denmark’s initiatives to reduce asylum numbers have proven effective. According to numbers released by the Immigration Ministry on Monday, just 43 people claimed asylum last week, marking the seventh consecutive week in which the number of asylum applications has been below 100.
While Denmark registered 21,000 asylum applications in 2015, only 4,700 were registered through the first eight months of 2016.
“We are following the developments in the entry numbers closely and we believe it is the right time to significantly reduce the overall capacity,” DIS head Tanja Franck said in a press release.
Of the 2,000 spaces that will be kept on stand-by, 1,000 of them will be DEMA tent spaces that “can be put in use again with a few days’ warning”.
“Experience shows that the developments within the asylum arena can quickly change and therefore we will keep a few spaces ready that can quickly be used again if the development turns around,” Franck said.
“That way, we will be better prepared for future increases in the accommodation levels than in the past two years,” she added.
Denmark saw a marked increase in asylum numbers in September 2015, when some 400 migrants and refugees arrived within a 24-hour period. That was then followed by an all-time refugee record in October.
In January, Denmark implemented border control measures in response to a similar move by Sweden. Since then, the ostensibly temporary measures have been extended numerous times and are currently in place through November 12th.
Denmark also passed a comprehensive immigration bill in January that aimed to make the country less attractive to refugees and migrants. The bill included the infamous ‘jewellery law’, which allows authorities to confiscate valuables from arriving migrants. Although it took effect in February, it wasn’t used for the first time until late June.
Home to 5.6 million people, Denmark's 21,000 asylum applications in 2015 made it one of the top EU destinations per capita for migrants. The totals, however, were far behind the 163,000 registered in neighbouring Sweden."

After an October that set an all-time record for the number of asylum seekers, the Danish National Police (Rigspolitiet) estimate that at least 10,900 people crossed into Denmark between November 2nd-9th, significantly more than the 3,500 to 6,000 who have arrived in recent weeks.
The National Police stress that its number is an estimated minimum, based upon observations of arriving ferries, trains, private vehicles and buses.
As has been the case since refugees and migrants starting arriving in waves in early September, it is believed that the majority of last week’s record number are merely passing through Denmark rather than planning to seek asylum in the country.
New figures from the Swedish Migration Board seem to indicate that many of those who cross in to Denmark are continuing on to Sweden. Last week, Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbour saw its highest ever number of refugees over a seven-day period with 10,201 asylum applications.

Sweden’s one-week figure tops the 9,793 asylum seekers that Denmark received throughout the first nine months of 2015.
Andreas Kamm, the secretary general of the Danish Refugee Council, said that the massive numbers seen in the past week could reflect the fact that would-be asylum seekers are aware that Nordic countries, even traditionally open-armed Sweden, are moving to make it more difficult to receive asylum.

“It is now well-known that it is possible to come to Europe and many are speculating how long it will remain possible,” Kamm told TV2 News.
Kamm is currently in Jordan and said that word has spread about the new realities in the Nordics.
“I’m sitting with the Jordan Times and it has an article about the chillier [reception] in the Nordic countries. It states that the asylum rules are being tightened in Sweden and the fires at Swedish asylum centres,” he said.
Sweden said last week that it can no longer guarantee beds for all new arrivals. Sweden’s migration minister, Morgan Johansson, said at a press conference that with the country unable to promise accommodation, refugees may want to “go back to Germany or Denmark.”

That comment was quickly rebuked by his Danish counterpart, Inger Støjberg, who said “Sweden put itself in the situation it is in by carrying out extremely gentle immigration policies in every way.”
Both Støjberg and Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen made it clear that Denmark would not offer to take any of Sweden’s refugees."

Denmark has been in damage control mode as of late in an effort to counter the negative attention the Nordic nation received when its parliament overwhelmingly approved a migrant bill that allows for the confiscation of valuables and makes some refugees wait three years before they can apply for family reunifications.
After the bill was heavily criticized by human rights groups and the international media, Danish embassies began a counter-information campaign aimed at dispelling the myth that the nation has turned cold-hearted toward refugees and asylum seekers.

The Danish Embassy in the US took to social media to share ‘facts about Denmark and the refugee crisis in Europe’, tweeting that Denmark was one of the ten EU member states that received the most asylum seekers per capita in 2015 and that the 21,300 asylum seekers accepted by Denmark would be the equivalent of the United States receiving 1.2 million refugees.

Denmark has also belatedly pointed to laws on the books in other countries, including neighbours Germany, Sweden and Norway, that allow for the confiscation of valuables from refugees.
But the international criticism keeps coming.
In an editorial published in Tuesday’s edition of the International New York Times, Denmark was singled out for the strategy it has adopted to limit the number of asylum seekers.
“In what sometimes seems to be a race to the bottom among European countries to see who can be the least welcoming to asylum seekers, Denmark last week adopted an appallingly cruel strategy: stealing from people fleeing war. A law approved by the Danish legislators allows immigration authorities to seize valuable items, including jewellery and cash, to offset the cost of resettling them,” the Times editorial board wrote.
The editorial went on to criticize the government’s publication of advertisements in Lebanese newspapers that told would-be asylum seekers that benefits had been slashed and that those rejected for asylum would be sent out of the country post haste.
The paper did acknowledge Denmark’s contribution to Europe’s biggest refugee crisis sin decades, but accused the country of not keeping its head cool.
“Like many other Western nations, [Denmark] is panicking about the costs and burdens of the largest displacement crisis since World War II,” it said.
After chastising US for not doing its fair share, the Times called on Denmark to return to its historical position as a humanitarian leader.
“Denmark needs to be a leader in handling this crisis. It was the first nation to ratify the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, a pillar of international law. With every act of selfishness, nations like Denmark are rendering the promise of the refugee convention increasingly hollow,” the editorial concluded.

					12:07 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Denmark is forgetting itself in the wake of the refugee crisis',"Social scientist Nicol Savinetti argues that the state's response to the refugee influx and the backlash against a citizens' movement to help the newcomers serve as proof that Denmark has lost its way.
Denmark appears to be forgetting itself in the wake of the so-called refugee crisis. As a long-term resident of Copenhagen and a great supporter of the Venligboerne (‘Friendly Neighbours’) movement, I have found the recent hostile bullying tactics of leading political figures against ordinary Danish citizens a cause for great concern.
As one Facebook supporter of Venligboerne put it, Denmark is scared and refugees are scared.
When writer and activist Anne Lise Marstrand visited the refugee ‘tent’ camp in Haderslev she was so troubled by what she saw that she exercised her right to freedom of speech and told Denmark about the living conditions the asylum seekers are subjected to, and the working environment the staff are expected to perform within.
Marstrand wrote about the tent camp in Information and later expanded on her reasoning for speaking out in a column posted in Point of View International.
“I wanted to take the readers with me into the camp. I wanted to say: ‘Come along! See for yourself, listen for yourself, judge for yourself.’ And most importantly, I wanted to give a voice to some of the people who seldom get a chance to be heard,” she wrote.
Marstrand wrote that children in the camps only have the option of sitting in their cots or running around outside on what is essentially an unsafe building site with flammable materials and electrical installations that would be illegal anywhere else in Denmark; that the blocked toilets present a health hazard especially for children; that healthcare is only available in cases of emergency; and that the staff do not have the resources they need to carry out their work satisfactorily.
She also pointed out that the government had explicitly stated that the establishment of such tent camps was part of a strategic plan to deter asylum seekers from coming to Denmark.
Her reportage was seemingly offensive to Integration Minister Inge Støjberg, who reacted by publicly accusing Marstrand of lying about the camp conditions. When invited to a public debate about the situation in Haderslev, Støjberg declined, preferring to abuse Marstrand from a distance with the assistance of the Danish media. Unsurprisingly there was Facebook fury from the extensive community of Venligboer.
Meanwhile, the head of news for Radio24syv, Simon Andersen, commented that the asylum seekers and refugees should clean the toilets themselves and wondered how they had let the toilets get into such a sorry state in the first place.
His comments and the mocking tone in which they were presented provoked Mads Nygaard, one of the founders of Venligboerne, to write a very personal post that expressed in no uncertain terms what he thought of the journalist and his comments. He did not mince his words.
Within the next few days, Conservative MP Naser Khader, launched an attack on the Venligboerne initiative in his blog in the popular tabloid newspaper BT, saying that half of the group is made up of “semi-intellectual, arrogant, know-it-all wannabe attention-seekers”.
This is laughable. The positive outcomes for asylum seekers, refugees and regular citizens and residents of Denmark that are a result of the Venligboerne movement are truly immense and deserve the recognition they are getting from international organizations like the UNHCR. The movement has even been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by a Danish professor at Yale University.
To put things into perspective, take a look at the Danish prison system that was recently praised by a group of American professors in an article in the Washington Post. Prisoners enjoy the freedom to cook for themselves and have extended private family visits once a week, among other perks. The focus is on improving their lives and on personal and social reconstruction so that when they re-enter society they are ready to be productive and active citizens.
In light of such treatment of inmates, it is somewhat perverse that asylum seekers living in refugee camps and asylum centres in the middle of nowhere liken their situation to being in prison. The reality is that their situation is far, far worse.
According to a study carried out by Morten Goll, the founder of Trampoline House, residents of asylum centres in Denmark experience isolation, poverty and mental paralysis and after long stays. Upon ‘release’ when they get their refugee status, they often—unsurprisingly—become the very welfare clients that the state says they don’t want them to become.
Denmark is scared and refugees are scared. It is indeed scary that in a country that prides itself on its democratic values, its universalist approach to welfare and wellbeing and its relentless advocacy of freedom of speech, politicians attempt to silence civil society, or at the very least bully individuals and groups simply because they have the power to.
The reality is that the state subjects asylum seekers fleeing war and persecution to far worse treatment than prison inmates who have been convicted of crime.
Yes, Denmark has received one of the highest proportion of asylum seekers relative to its population. And yes, 81 percent of asylum applications have positive outcomes. And yes, it is one of the countries that spends the most on refugees per capita. But these statistics perhaps make the current situation all the more disturbing.
One might expect lively Facebook discussions and alternative points of view to be reported in the press in a country where there is freedom of expression, opinion and thought as well as a fervent anti-foreigner sentiment (as in the rest of Europe).
But targeted attacks by leading politicians on individuals and groups who, often in collaboration with the local authorities, are active in improving the everyday lives of refugees and asylum seekers, are tactics one might associate with authoritarian dictatorships rather than not constitutional democracies.
I am left wondering why Denmark seems to ignore the long-term impact of its supposedly ‘deterrent’ asylum policies, which ultimately produce welfare clients at a cost to state and society instead of active, resourceful, healthy networked citizens and denizens?
Residents of asylum centres and refugee camps have the potential to be the latter with the help of the Venligboerne and other grassroots initiatives, without dipping into the public purse. Attempts to silence voices from and beyond the camps destabilizes society and is harmful to Denmark’s international reputation for democracy, freedom of speech and consensus.

					08:36 CEST+02:00				",Sören Billing/AFP,Denmark sticks to hardline refugee stance,"Denmark's government, which depends on the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DF) to pass legislation, is sticking to a hardline stance on refugees despite growing public support for a more open approach.
""Denmark has become the Hungary of the Nordic region, a transit country to a place that will welcome a refugee,"" the liberal Politiken daily wrote recently.
Known for their egalitarian policies, the Danes have been named the world's happiest people in numerous surveys and enjoy one of the world's highest standards of living.
But as Europe's refugee crisis spread to Scandinavia, many were shocked to wake up to pictures of refugees running from police and walking on motorways just to reach the Swedish border.
""Denmark is not a good country for us,"" Abdulrahman Alshehagi, a 26-year-old Syrian lorry driver, told AFP after walking on the country's roads and then taking the train across a bridge to the southern Swedish city of Malmö.
For Copenhagen politicians, the sight of refugees avoiding Denmark at all costs may initially have seemed like something that would appeal to voters, especially the one-in-five who in a June general election backed DF.
The right-of-centre Venstre party, which took power as a minority single-party administration in June, campaigned on tougher asylum rules and halving benefits for newly arrived immigrants to make the country less attractive to refugees.
To ensure that they got the message, it placed adverts in several Lebanese newspapers on September 7 warning that ""Denmark has decided to tighten the regulations concerning refugees.""
Counter reaction
Published just days after images of drowned Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi shook Europe and the world, the adverts drew widespread criticism and helped galvanize those who oppose the government's immigration policies.
Within days, a Facebook group for Danes helping asylum seekers with their everyday lives attracted thousands of new members and became a forum for people willing to drive refugees to Sweden, which has more generous asylum rules.
Nynne, a 44-year-old woman from an affluent part of Copenhagen, said that although she had never considered herself an activist, she got into her car and drove to Lolland, a rural part of Denmark where many refugees arrive on ferries, because she ""wanted to do something.""
After unsuccessfully scouring the pitch dark roads, postings to the Facebook group eventually guided her to three Iraqi Kurds who wanted to go north of the border.
To avoid unwanted attention, the three spent the night in her apartment until the border crossing was busier.
After briefly suspending rail links between Denmark and Germany to prevent refugees from entering, Danish police last week said they would allow people to pass through the country without registering if they were not planning to seek asylum.
On Tuesday they said 7,500 migrants had entered the country since September 6th, of whom less than 1,000 had applied for asylum.
Refugees welcome?
In another sign that public support for Denmark's ever-tighter asylum rules may be waning, some 30,000 people joined a Copenhagen rally on Saturday in favour of taking in more refugees.
Paul Tyler, a consultant who moved to the city from London 10 years ago, said he went to the demonstration with his children because the dramatic gains of DF meant ""people are now realizing that if you want things to happen you have to be more proactive.""
EU member Denmark has negotiated an opt-out of Europe's immigration policy and there is little support in parliament for accepting refugees under a European quota plan.
Some lawmakers say Denmark has done enough: Last year, it was the EU's fifth largest recipient of refugees, in relation to its size.
By contrast, a Monday survey by pollster Voxmeter showed that 78 percent of Danes wanted the country to be part of the EU's plan to distribute refugees around the continent.
Bjarke Møller, head of the pro-Europe think tank Europa, said Danish politicians were pushing ""policies of the past.""
For almost 15 years, the growing influence of DF -- now the right-wing bloc's biggest party -- fuelled Danish lawmakers' ever-harsher rhetoric on immigration.
""The political parties are like supertankers that chart a course and then don't want to change it,"" he told news agency Ritzau.
Still, after Denmark's two biggest broadcasters on Monday announced a Syrian fundraiser, many Facebook reactions were negative.
""Never, we should help our own first,"" Susanne Sus wrote, while Bjarne Larsen said: ""As long as there are cuts to our elderly, sick and child services remain, I'm giving nothing.""
In the right-wing Jyllands-Posten daily -- which in 2005 published the Prophet Mohammed cartoons that triggered deadly protests in some countries -- little has changed.
On September 4, while the world was still reeling from the images of Aylan Kurdi's dead body, it published an editorial titled ""Europe's borders"" questioning ""how much religious and cultural diversity there is room for in Europe."""

If you see a massive human sitting on a boat in the Copenhagen harbour on Monday, you’re not imagining things. Not have giants overtaken the Danish capital.
The strange site is instead the latest work from Belgian visual artists Schellekens & Peleman.
Entitled “Inflatable Refugee”, the 6-metre high blow-up is a “symbol of the dehumanization of the refugee and the current refugee crisis happening in the world” according to a press release.
The floating political statement will sail from Helsingør to Copenhagen aboard the Hawila, a 25.5m long refurbished wooden galeas that was built in Norway in 1935.
It is scheduled to arrive in the capital around 3pm on Monday.
In a statement provided to the artists, Copenhagen Mayor Frank Jensen said he welcomed the arrival of the 'Inflatable Refugee'.
""The current migration crisis in Europe is one of the most difficult questions that all cities in Europe are dealing with. I believe that art has the possibility to provoke and make us consider the dilemmas, we are currently facing, in a different perspective,"" Jensen said.
The inflatable is made out of the same material as the boats used by human traffickers crossing the Mediterranean Sea as part of the artists' attempt to symbolizing the journey refugees go through in order to reach Europe.
Following this theme, the designers created the inflatable in the image of an adult male who “gazes blankly into the distance” and who’s sheer size matches the “reactions his arrival in the Western world evoked”.
The Inflatable Refugee is meant to complement Schellekens & Peleman’s ‘Moving Stories’ project, which was conceived after the artist group “detected a (growing) gap between newcomers and natives in any place in the world”.
Everywhere the “Inflatable Refugee” goes, the artists send random locals letters written by refuges. The content of the letters are up to each writer, and the receiver is able to respond if he or she wishes.

In a recent report published by the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS), it was revealed that in 2014, a number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Denmark supplied incorrect information about their age.
The number of individuals who sought asylum under the status of an unaccompanied minor rose dramatically from 354 in 2013 to a total of 818 in 2014. Some 80 percent of these were classified as having a stated age between 15-17.
Of those 818, DIS investigated the age of 282 refugees and found that 203 of them, or 72 percent of the questionable cases, were actually above the age of 18 despite claims to the contrary.

“If there are doubts about the verity of an asylum seeker’s claim to be under the age of 18, an age examination is conducted,” DIS explained in its report.
An age examination entails medical specialists assessing a person’s age based on their teeth, bones and a genital examination.

A 2011 commission concluded that it was possible to determine a person’s age within a year’s accuracy by such an examination. However, the head of the commission, Bent Ottesen, noted that these tests should only be used as supporting evidence.
“Such an examination will always have a certain degree of uncertainty and should if possible not be the sole basis for assessing a person’s age,” he told MetroXpress.

According to UNICEF, the births of nearly 230 million children under the age of five worldwide, or around one in three, have never been recorded, meaning that they cannot document their age and, in many cases, do not even know their exact age.
Danish People’s Party MP Peter Skaarup said that his party would push for the coming government to conduct more age examinations on unaccompanied minors, arguing that they are lying about their age.

“When you discover that there are so many who are cheating, then we should be testing more of them. It should also have a consequence on their chances of being granted asylum,” he told MetroXpress.
On the other hand, Socialist People’s Party MP Jonas Dahl told MetroXpress that he believes that refugees should be given the benefit of the doubt.
“If you are not one hundred percent certain [about the accuracy of the age examination, ed.], then you should not be making a verdict based upon such a test,” he argued."

Although the country’s refugee agency Flygtningenævnet, which is part of the Ministry of Immigration and Integration, wished to submit the information, a section relating to FGM was removed, making the response less controversial, according to a report by newspaper Information.
The decision to remove such information was taken by the ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Justice’s section for state and human rights (Stats- og Menneskeretskontor), according to the report.
Information reports that public documents to which it has gained access show correspondence between the refugee agency and justice ministry confirming the decision.
Denmark was in January criticised by the UN’s Committee on the Rights of the Child (OHCHR) for refusing asylum to a Somali woman and her infant daughter who risked FGM if they were returned to the northeast African country.
The criticism was not anchored to that specific case, however. OHCHR stated that Denmark was obliged by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to not repeat the practice in similar cases.
In its mandatory response to the UN remarks, the justice ministry removed information about its general practice, Information writes.
The official Danish response also failed to explain why the refugee agency will not review the individual case, why it will not change practice in future and why it does not agree with the OHCHR criticism, legal experts told Information.
The Ministry of Justice did not wish to comment on the issue.
In a written comment, the Ministry of Immigration and Integration told Information that the final submitted response to the UN summarised “which steps the specific case had required the (refugee) agency to take”.

The Danish government may have misled Syrian refugees when it took out advertisements in Lebanese newspapers to warn off migrants, a supervisory body said on Thursday.
The adverts could have given Syrian refugees ""an incorrect view of what their situation would have been in Denmark,"" said parliamentary ombudsman Jørgen Steen Sørensen, who ensures that public authorities comply with the laws and other statutes governing their actions.
""The advertisement could very easily have made them decide where to seek asylum on the wrong basis,"" he said in a statement.

Parts of the advert highlighted rules that were largely irrelevant for Syrian refugees, such as the possibility of asylum seekers being ""sent home quickly,"" he noted.
Denmark currently only rejects around two percent of Syrian asylum claims.
""It is also highlighted that you as a refugee risk having your residency withdrawn. But in practice this has happened very rarely, and certainly not to Syrian refugees,"" Sørensen said.
Denmark's Venstre government, which relies on parliamentary support from the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party, placed the adverts in three Arabic-language newspapers and one English-language daily in Lebanon on September 7.
The adverts also highlighted that social benefits for newly-arrived refugees had been slashed by half and that family reunification is not allowed for the first year after they arrive.

					10:43 CET+01:00				", The Local,Denmark to open refugee camp amid aid criticism,"Denmark’s first tent camp for refugees is expected to open this weekend as the nation faces criticism for diverting international development funds to deal with asylum seekers within the country.
A tent camp for some 250 asylum seekers in the northern Jutland city of Thisted could open as early as this weekend, a spokesman for the Danish Emergency Management Agency (Beredskabstyrelsen - DEMA) said.
The tents are being erected at a DEMA centre and an additional 168 asylum seekers will be put in the centre’s existing buildings.
DEMA spokesman Peter Kragh told Ritzau earlier this week that the agency has nearly finished its preparations but it will ultimately be the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) that decides when the asylum seekers will move in to the nation’s first tent camp.

“We promised that it would take a week to establish the tent camp so throughout the course of the weekend the tents should be ready,” he said.
The plan is to put single male asylum seekers in the tents, where they will be given a folding bed, a mattress and a sleeping bag. It is up to DIS to decide if families will be housed in the DEMA buildings and the immigration agency will also be the one to select the asylum seekers for the tents.

The tent camps prepare to open as Denmark has upped its estimate for the expected number of asylum seekers in 2016 from 15,000 to 25,000. That increase was used in the government’s recently-approved budget to justify cutting the nation’s development aid from 0.87 percent of its gross national income to 0.71 percent, with up to one third of the funds to be used internally on refugees and asylum seekers in Denmark.

A senior researcher with the Danish Institute for International Studies, Lars Engberg, told Politiken that the government’s plan represents “the most significant cut of development aid ever”.
According to the newspaper’s calculations, Denmark will spend 15 billion kroner on development aid in 2016, but 4.4 billion of that figure will be spent on refugees within the country.
“Residents have been told that development aid should support people in the world’s poorest countries. The question is whether we should even continue to call it development aid when so much of it will be used on refugees here in Denmark,” Engberg said.
The government's plans were also criticised from abroad, with international anti-poverty group ONE calling the move ""a step backwards for a country which normally leans forward on development"".
“This decision by the government both to cut and to divert aid is misguided. Denmark has become the largest country recipient of its own aid. These funds are intended to help the developing world,"" ONE spokeswoman Diane Sheard said.
""Cutting promised levels of aid not only risks the lives of the world’s poorest, it removes Denmark’s position as a leader in the global fight against extreme poverty,"" she added.

The government’s increase in its estimate for the number of refugees that Denmark will accept next year was included in an early version of its budget but was removed under pressure from the anti-immigration Danish People’s Party (DF).
“In connection to these [budget] negotiations, we don’t want to take responsibility for some sort of specific asylum figure. The government must be responsible for that […] it is the government’s responsibility so it shouldn’t be included in the budget,” DF spokesman Peter Skaarup told Jyllands-Posten.

					13:40 CET+01:00				",Ritzau/The Local,Immigration minister panned by opposition over ill refugee deportation scandal,"Opposition politicians say they find Denmark’s minister for immigration Inger Støjberg 'hard to trust' after she admitted to poor practice by her ministry.
In a parliamentary hearing Thursday, Støjberg admitted that the Ministry of Immigration and Integration had been too slow to adopt a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling on forced expulsions of seriously ill asylum seekers.
Individuals may have been illegally deported from Denmark despite being seriously ill as a result of the malpractice.
Opposition politicians did not hold back in their criticism of the minister following Thursday’s hearing at Copenhagen’s Christiansborg parliament.
She was rebuked for placing responsibility on public servants working in her ministry as well as called untrustworthy.
Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen, spokesperson on immigration issues with the left-wing Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) party, said Støjberg was yet to answer several questions over the controversy.
A second parliamentary questioning session is likely, according to news agency Ritzau, despite the minister’s admissions of wrongdoing by the authority.
“It is shocking how lightly she takes such a serious issue,” Schmidt-Nielsen said.
“[This is] a case where her ministry has not realised a ruling has been made by the ECHR.
“That is a mistake that can cause deaths,” she added.
“It should be possible to trust that what is going on [in the ministry] is in fact legal. We can no longer do that with Støjberg as minister,” the Red-Green Alliance MP continued.
The immigration ministry is reportedly now searching for the whereabouts of seven deported individuals with a view to reviewing their cases.
Josephine Fock, spokesperson on immigration with the environmentalist Alternative party, also rained down criticism on Støjberg.
“It concerns me that she takes it so lightly and places the blame on her public servants,” Fock said.
“We cannot have a ministry that carries out an illegal practice for 13 months. There must be consequences, but we will have to see what those consequences will be,” she added.
During the hearing on Thursday, Støjberg said her ministry had acted incorrectly in taking more than a year to adjust its processes to comply with the December 2016 ECHR ruling.
“Speaking straight, it took too long [for the ministry] to become aware of the ruling. And it also took too long for the [Danish] interpretation to be put in place,” she said during Thursday’s hearing, where she was questioned by fellow MPs.
Prior to the hearing, newspaper Politiken reported that the ECHR ruling was relevant in 11 cases, in which seven have already resulted in persons leaving Denmark or being deported.
The ruling – known as the Paposhvili ruling – did not become known to Støjberg’s ministry, which determines cases related to the granting of humanitarian residence, until March 2017, when it was notified by the Ministry of Justice, reports Ritzau.
Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbours Norway and Sweden had both already implemented the ruling into their practices by that time, according to previous reports. It was not until last weekend that the Danish immigration ministry announced a four-week freeze on forced expulsions of rejected asylum seekers who are seriously ill while it further assesses the issue.
“In this instance, there was a regrettable course of events, which I as minister am obviously not satisfied with,” Støjberg said at Thursday’s hearing, adding that a heavy workload in her ministry was one of the reasons for the breakdown in correct practice.
“It is remarkable that Støjberg has not recognised that she has a responsibility. She’s the one in charge, and we know incorrect information was given to parliament in this case,” Fock said.
Denmark’s largest opposition party, the Social Democrats, was not amongst the parties that summoned Støjberg to Thursday’s consultation.
But the Social Democrat spokesperson for immigration Astrid Krag joined the remaining opposition parties in calling for a follow-up hearing over the issue.

Denmark’s proposed cuts to refugees' welfare benefits will violate the UN’s refugee convention from 1951, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) wrote in a hearing statement to the government.
The UNHCR’s statement was one of 35 submitted in response to the proposed cuts. All but one of them were critical of Denmark’s plans, including a letter from the Danish Red Cross that its general secretary said was the most negative hearing statement he's ever written.
See the assembled hearing statements here (the UNHCR's begins on page 163)
The UNHCR said that the Danish government’s plans to limit the right to the welfare benefit known as kontanthjælp and the student stipend SU to residents who have lived in Denmark for seven of the past right years amounts to a convention violation.
“Article 23 [of the 1951 Convention, ed.] provides that ‘The Contracting States shall accord to refugees lawfully staying in their territory the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as is accorded to their nationals’ [emphasis added],” the statement reads.
“Article 24 of the 1951 Convention provides that refugees lawfully staying in the territory of a State party shall be accorded the same treatment as is accorded to nationals with regard to social security, including unemployment, old age and family responsibilities,” the statement continues.
Under the Danish proposal, all refugees and foreigners who have not resided in Denmark for seven out of the past eight years – as well as Danish citizens who have lived outside of the EU – will only be entitled to a new so-called ‘integration benefit’, which is significantly lower than regular unemployment benefits. New arrivals will not be entitled to paid holiday while on the benefit and the time spent as an asylum seeker does not count toward the residency requirement.
See also: Denmark to reduce asylum benefits
The UNHCR said that despite applying the same rules to Danish citizens who have lived outside the EU, it is refugees who will bear the brunt of the cuts.
“While formally the integration allowance is also intended for Danish citizens who have lived abroad outside the European Union, in reality it will primarily affect refugees and others with a foreign background. UNHCR is thus concerned that the proposed residency requirement to be eligible for the kontant- or uddannelseshjælp and instead introducing a significantly lower integrationsydelse for refugees who are not able to find employment during the first seven years will have a discriminatory effect and that the impact of the proposal will be detrimental for refugees,” the organization wrote.
The integration benefit will pay a single adult with no children receive 5,945 kroner per month before tax, compared to the current 10,849 kroner unemployment benefit – a 45 percent cut. An additional 1,500 kroner per month can be earned by passing an intermediate Danish language exam.

The UNHCR goes on to criticize planned changes to how child and pension benefits are applied to refugees, once again arguing that the proposals violate the 1951 Convention.
Despite the criticism in the UNHCR’s 12-page report, and the criticism of over 30 other organizations, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg stood by the proposed changes.
“The new integration benefit is in no way a sign of discrimination,” she told Politiken.
“It serves to the contrary the very objective goal of needing to be able to keep up with the influx [of refugees] to Denmark. We can’t as it is now, which is why we want to make it less financially attractive to come to Denmark,” Støjberg said.
“It also serves another just as essential goal, which is to give a strong incentive to get a job as quickly as possible,” she added.
Støjberg has repeatedly said that additional restrictions to Denmark's immigration policies will be announced shortly."

Rasmussen and his fellow EU leaders on Thursday agreed to move forward on a German-backed plan for Turkey to stem the flow of migrants setting off from its coast.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the EU-Turkey action plan is now “our priority” and Rasmussen agreed.

Following the UN’s call for “more solidarity” between European nations and a “more equitable distribution of refugees”, Justice Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that Denmark would set its own rules for accepting refugees.
“We want to carry out Danish asylum policies. In this area, we don’t wish to choose the European way,” Frederiksen said from Brussels, according to news agency Ritzau.
Frederiksen was in the Belgian capital to meet with her European counterparts. The meeting came on the same day that a UNHCR spokesman told The Local that Europe needs to adopt an agreement that would allow Syrian refugees to legally cross European borders.

With no sign of an end to the Syrian conflict, the UNHCR's William Spindler said it’s urgent that European countries find a way to share the refugee burden more equally.
“The attitude now is to shift the problem to somewhere else. We can’t continue doing this; we have to show more solidarity within Europe, and between Europe and other countries receiving most refugees,” he said.
Under the EU’s Dublin Regulation, Denmark can send asylum seekers back to other EU countries if they registered with authorities there first.
Although Denmark’s EU opt-out on justice affairs exempts the country from the Dublin Regulation, Denmark made an additional agreement with the EU to honour the regulation, which states that the member state that stores finger prints on an asylum claim is the country responsible for processing the application.
With most refugees entering Europe from the south, countries like Italy and Greece struggle to keep up and refugees often end up housed in criticizable conditions.
But Frederiksen said that refugees should remain the responsibility of the countries that first handled them.
“Even though there are tough conditions, we need to stand firm on the fact that the country where one first enters is the country where they seek asylum,” the Danish justice minister said."

Jøran Kallmyr, a state secretary in the Ministry of Justice who was appointed by the anti-immigration Progress Party, said the country also planned a series of newspaper adverts in Russia and other countries.
“The aim is to get the number down. Many are coming and many of them are not from Syria,” Kallmyr told state broadcaster NRK on Sunday. “The refugees choose where they travel, based on what they know about the country. Although Denmark is a safe country, there are relatively few who have sought asylum there.”
Kallmyr said the campaign would, among other things, inform potential asylum seekers of the Norwegian government's proposals to cut the benefits they will receive on arrival.
“It is better that they discover it in advance than that they are disappointed,” he argued.
Denmark’s foreign ministry in September published advertisements in four Lebanese newspapers warning Syrian refugees that the country had recently halved the level of benefits received by refugees.
The strategy appears to have had some success. Of the 13,000 refugees who passed through Denmark in September, only 1,500 applied for asylum.
Kallmyr said that Norway doesn't intend to spend too much money on the newspaper campaigns, relying instead on Facebook and Twitter.
“The main thing now is to use social media. It is cheap and reaches many people,” he said.

In September, around 100 to 140 new refugees have come to the country every day. The number may end up on 3000 asylum seekers by the end of the month.

That’s way more than the Justice Ministry’s estimate earlier this year of 7,500 to 10,000 refugees. Denmark took in nearly 4,000 refugees in 2013. Viewed in relation to total population, Denmark took in the fourth largest number of refugees last year amongst EU countries. For every million residents in Denmark, 694 refugees were accepted.
Denmark still lies far behind Sweden, which accepted a total of 28,000 refugees. That’s 2,952 refugees per million inhabitants. Housing struggles Of the 3,889 Danish resident permits granted to refugees last year, over a third went to Syrians. The 1,382 Syrians given refugee status in Denmark represented by far the largest single group. As a whole, Denmark took in 50 percent more refugees in 2013 than in 2012. But the influx of refugees has led to housing problems, as many of the refugees are currently living in camping trailers, hotels and former care homes.

Kim Kliver, a spokesman for South Zealand and Lolland-Falster Police, told TV2 that police would not let the refugees out of their sight and suggested that they would be brought back to Rødby for processing rather than be allowed to walk to Sweden.
Travelling to Sweden on foot would take between 40 to 50 hours and would require either ferry connections or walking across bridges that are not open to pedestrian traffic.
Another group of refugees who arrived via train in Røderkro in southern Jutland on Monday morning reportedly refused to get off. According to TV2, the refugees did not want to risk being registered in Denmark and wanted instead to travel further on to either Germany or Sweden.
In a press release, South Jutland Police said that a small confrontation flared up when officers met the group.
“When the officers went to control the travellers, a situation occurred in which a single officer used pepper spray against a traveller when the strain on, among others, a woman with her children became dangerous. The man was subsequently okay,” the release read.
Meanwhile, authorities in the southern Swedish city of Malmö said that around 70 refugees had arrived there on Sunday night and added that they were ready to welcome any others.

“Shuttles between Germany and Denmark run all night and it’s not too far to Malmö,” he said.
Denmark has a tougher approach towards migrants compared to its northern Nordic neighbour. Just over 9,300 Syrians have moved to Denmark over the past year. Meanwhile Sweden has received asylum applications from more than 60,000 people.

Danish nurseries, daycare centres and after-school centres would benefit from having adult refugees who can relate to child refugees who have recently arrived in the country, the Danish Union of Early Childhood and Youth Educators (BUPL) said on Wednesday.
Therefore, the group is urging the government to look at relaxing the rules on who is allowed to work with children.
In Denmark, individuals who come in direct contact with children under the age of 15 may be required to obtain a so-called childhood certificate (børneattest). The certificate includes information on any previous convictions for sexual assault, child pornography or incest.
BUPL chairwoman Elisa Bergmann has proposed relaxing the requirement for refugees, who often cannot obtain the paperwork from their home countries needed in order to get a certificate issued.
“In the long term, we will need refugees who are trained educators or youth workers, or who are able to perform the role of nursery assistant. We need that in order to integrate the refugee children,” she told Ritzau.
Culture Minister Bertel Haarder is responsible for the certificate legislation and he said he is open to the idea of relaxing the rules for refugees.
While BUPL supports the idea of relaxing the rules, she stressed the need to be “as safe as possible” when letting people work in the nation’s daycare institutions without the required background check.
“But we are in an extraordinary situation in which there are people coming to this country for whom we cannot get the needed information on. One can ask themselves how long these people should be kept out because they can’t show the right papers,” Bergmann said.
BUPL suggested that any refugees placed in the institutions should be partnered with a trained pedagogue.
The Danish People’s Party (DF) was very critical of the proposal, saying it would put children at risk and be a form of discrimination against Danish workers who would still be required to submit to a background check and provide the necessary certificate.
“As I read it, the government is preparing to let refugees be employed in daycare institutions without the child certificate. I think it is completely unheard of that one would even consider relaxing these rules, which are made to protect children against attacks,” DF spokeswoman Pernille Bendixen told Avisen.dk.
In a written response to Bendixen, Haarder stressed that with or without the certificate, there should always be “a comprehensive and concrete evaluation of whether an individual is suited to working with children” before being employed by an institution."

The opposition Social Democrat Party has not confirmed whether it would go through with the rollbacks should it regain power at the next election.
According to a parliamentary answer provided by Minister of Finance Jacob Jensen, the so-called 'low integration benefit' (lave integrationsydelse) has saved state coffers one billion kroner ($145 million).
The new lower welfare for refugees was introduced by the Venstre Party government after it won the 2015 general election. The move was part of a series of tighter measures taken by the government aimed at making Denmark a less attractive proposition for asylum seekers.
The lower payment is equivalent to about half the amount received by people on normal unemployment benefits.
The new rules were expanded on 1st of July 2016 to included any refugee registered in Denmark within the last seven years.
The savings made by the state from the lower payments could add up to 1 billion kroner by 2020, depending on the number of refugees taken in by Denmark in the intervening years, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The government, along with supporting parties Liberal Alliance and the Conservatives, recently said that they were prepared to use the savings to reduce tax, reports Jyllands-Posten.
The anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DF), which has more MPs in Parliament than any other party apart from the Social Democrats, has stated that further cuts to immigration are needed before tax reduction are affordable.
But Jensen told Jyllands-Posten that the measures taken since 2015 had made significant savings already.
""The first billion has already been found by introduction the integration benefits. It is therefore in our view wrong to say that financing can not be taken from immigration,"" said Jensen.
But Jensen did not confirm whether the government intended to make further cuts in the area.
""The are undoubtedly other places, where that is possible, if we look for them,"" the minister said to Jyllands-Posten.
The Social Democrats voted against the low integration benefits in parliament after the government rejected the suggestion of including provisions for children such as free after school activities, clothes and books in the benefits package.
The party has now criticised the government for its apparent use of the saved money for tax breaks.
""Whether it's 100 billion or one billion kroner, I think it's wrong to use this money for top tax bracket reductions,"" acting political spokesperson Ane Halsboe-Jørgensen told Jyllands-Posten.

					06:56 CEST+02:00				",Agustin Millan,How expats are helping refugees in Denmark,"The ongoing refugee crisis has increased the requests to help at Copenhagen International Voluntary Club but the expat leading the efforts hopes it's more than just a passing fad.
The Copenhagen International Volunteer Club (CIVC) was founded in 2011 to give internationals living in Denmark a chance to pursue their interests in a wide range of activities, ranging from urban gardening to medical exchanges and animal welfare.
But with the arrival of Europe's current refugee crisis, interest in the group has increased significantly and there are now over 1,000 people involved with CIVC and a number of groups that have expressed interest in collaborations.
Andrew Madsen, a Canadian anthropologist and language teacher living in Denmark since 1999, said that internationals are drawn to volunteering for a number of different reasons.
""There is a lot to be done. Since we set up the organization more and more people have joined and each one has a different reason,"" Madsen, CIVC's organizer and coordinator for refugee issues, told The Local.
“Last year we had weekly briefing meetings for our refugee work with just six or seven people, which we thought was a lot. Now, we meet every two weeks and there are around 30 or 40 people attending,” he said.
Madsen spearheads CIVC's two groups that help refugees, with one focusing on developing education-related projects and the other providing quick response in case of emergencies.
""We provide assistance in the short term but we also plan for the future,"" he said.
One of CIVC's primary focuses is to help refugees successfully settle in Denmark through employment.
“We work to get these people hired by companies. There are people with some high qualifications, but there’s also a need for simple jobs for those who are less educated. We need to always think about the here and now needs as well as the refugees’ long term future in Denmark,"" Madsen said.
CIVC is currently working in partnership with the Red Cross on a campaign to collect heavy winter clothing and boots for refugees as winter approaches. Prior to that, the CIVC has headed initiatives such as the collection of old computers to help teach refugees basic IT skills, operation of the second hand clothing shop at the Sandholm asylum centre, child care services for parents in the evenings and various social activities such as a movie night.
While more and more Danes and internationals have donated their time, money and goods since the European refugee crisis fully arrived in Denmark last month, Madsen hopes that the interest will not wane.
“It’s important not to forget that refugee issues are something ongoing. As time goes by people tend to forget about it but there are a lot of things to do, especially in helping people find a job and settle into their new homes,"" he said.
And it is exactly there where groups like CIVC can have a major impact.
""Just the fact that we, too, are living in a foreign country makes us different from Danish organizations. Besides, Danish volunteering is traditionally carried out by either very young people or retired people whereas we have people of all ages and all backgrounds: doctors, au-pairs, unemployed people… there’s a broad base of people who come and help whenever they can.”
Madsen told The Local that CIVC is always looking for more people who want to get involved. He said the group is also happy to help others who might not want to join CIVC but still want to engage with refugee issues in a non-politicized way.
""Everybody is welcome to come and join a briefing session but there are also a lot of things people can do themselves without being deeply involved with our group, such as running a clothing collection drive at their school or workplace. We can provide logistical support and other help for those efforts,” he said.
Madsen cautioned however that there is a limit to what is actually needed.
“At this time of the year people tend to donate summer clothing while in the spring people tend to donate winter clothing. There is a mismatch between what is being donated and what is needed and this mismatch needs to be changed. There is also a lot of inappropriate clothing donated ... party clothing and mini-skirts are not usually in big demand in an asylum centre,” he said.
The Copenhagen International Volunteering Club will host its next meeting on October 30th."

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has criticised Denmark’s newly-announced restrictions on family reunification for refugees. The Danish government announced last month that refugees fleeing the civil wars like the one in Syria will be eligible for a new, one-year temporary residence permit. On Tuesday, the government followed that up by saying that only if a refugee has their permit extended beyond that first year can they bring their family members to Denmark. See also: Denmark to limit family reunification for refugees According to Pia Prutz Phiri, the UNHCR’s regional head in northern Europe, Denmark must realise that it has global responsibilities. “It is unrealistic to believe that Denmark can isolate itself from what is happening globally. If there are conflicts and disasters, they are something that we must all take responsibility for,” Phiri told DR. Phiri told DR that Denmark’s new restrictions come close to violating international laws. “If we talk about Syrians – most of whom, we believe, are refugees under the international convention – and you don’t immediately give them family reunification, you are on the edge of international law,” Phiri said. See also: New refugee proposal: Send them back “Denmark must continue to fulfil its international responsibilities and recognise those who come to Denmark as refugees and see that they enter Danish society as soon as possible, and that also means that they should be united with their family as soon as possible,” she added. Phiri told DR that the UNHCR wants to see all countries proactively provide family reunification options for refugees so that asylum seekers avoid dangerous escape routes to reach their ultimate destinations.
The UN estimates that there are currently more than 51 million refugees worldwide, the highest number since World War II. Denmark is expected to take in 20,000 refugees in 2014. The UNHCR's criticism comes on the heels of proposals from opposition parties to stop accepting refugees in Denmark and instead send them back where they came from."

Some municipalities tell the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen) not to send them refugees from certain countries, Berlingske newspaper revealed. Chechens are a particularly unwanted group, with the municipalities of Haderslev, Skive and Brønderslev all telling Immigration Services not to send them any more. “We don’t have the group [Chechens, ed.] and we don’t want them either based on the experiences of the surrounding municipalities,” Brønderslev wrote in a ‘priority request’ to Immigration Service according to Berlingske. “We have had bad experiences with integrating Chechens. We currently have quite a few Chechens in Skive Council but the majority of them are difficult to integrate and many have moved away,” Skive wrote to Immigration Service. “Haderslev Council cannot accommodate more Chechens,” that municipality wrote. Another unwanted group is the Roma. Sønderborg Council told Immigration Service that it “wants to put an end to the visitation of Roma people from the former Yugoslavia who come on humanitarian grounds”. Danish municipalities provide requests and recommendations to Immigration Service each year as a way to build upon previous successes with certain groups, but many of the municipalities also use the annual exercise as an opportunity to tell the national authorities which refugees they do not want. This would appear to be in violation of the nation’s immigration laws which state that no distinctions can be made based on nationality when helping those in need. At the Danish Red Cross, general secretary Anders Ladekarl said it makes sense that municipalities would try to specialise in housing a certain group of immigrants, but stressed that everyone should be welcome. “No one should be turned away. Passive racism cannot be involved when it’s time to add up the numbers,” he told Berlingske. Immigration lawyer Bjørn Dilou Jacobsen told Berlingske that the municipalities’ ‘negative lists’ could be in violation of the law. “As a starting point, one should never discriminate based on race or ethnicity. When you discriminate indirectly it must be impartial and proportionate, not just the argument that some types of people are difficult to integrate,” he said. The mayors of Brønderslev, Sønderborg, Haderslev and Skive rejected the notion that they are discriminating against anyone, and an Immigration Service spokeswoman told Berlingske that her agency does not give much consideration to the municipalities’ ‘negative lists’."

					08:23 CEST+02:00				",Peter Kenworthy,40 years a refugee: From Western Sahara to CPH,"November will mark forty years since Morocco invaded and colonized Western Sahara, today Africa’s last colony. Abba Malainin was only a child when he had to flee the war by foot through the desert to Algeria, to refugee camps where his family and thousands of other refugees still live today.
Four decades ago, tens of thousands of Western Sahara's indigenous population, the Saharawis, fled the advancing Moroccan army and bomber planes across the border into neighbouring Algeria.
Here they set about building what they thought would be temporary refugee camps in one of the most inhospitable parts of the world, the so-called “Devil’s Garden”, where sand-storms are frequent and where temperatures can exceed 50C.
Some 165,000 Saharawis remain in the camps in the Tindouf Province today. Others remain in occupied Western Sahara, one of the world’s most repressive and torturing regimes. And others still live in exile in Spain or in Denmark, like Abba Malainin.
Through the desert
Abba Malainin was seven years old in 1975 when the Moroccan army invaded his home town of El Aaiun, the largest city of Western Sahara, with aerial bombardments with napalm and white phosphorus. A genocide forgotten by the international media, he insists.
“My family and I were living a normal life in El Aaiun with its mild desert climate when our lives were turned upside down by the military invasion by Morocco. Suddenly our lives became a nightmare,"" he recalls.
Abba and his family initially settled in the El Aaiun refugee camp (named after the city in Western Sahara) and ended up in the Auserd camp. “There was nothing there at all when we arrived”, he says.

Almost-ambassador in Amager
Today, Abba is the Saharawi liberation movement Polisario’s representative in Denmark. If Denmark had recognized Western Sahara’s republic in exile, the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), as over 80 other countries have done over the years, he would be an ambassador.
Instead, Abba lives in a small flat in Amager not far from Copenhagen Airport, which is rather practical when he has to travel to and from the refugee camps where his mother and much of his family still live in tents and mud-brick houses with corrugated iron roofs.
Abba goes there either to visit his family or on official Polisario business, making sure that Danish politicians, NGOs and journalists don’t forget the Saharawis and get to see what it is like to live in refugee camps that have stood for 40 years.
A republic in exile
In many ways the Saharawi refugee camps are unlike other refugee camps. The Saharawis managed to build a proto-state in the desert camps. SADR is a member of the African Union and has a government, an elected parliament, a constitution, schools, hospitals, social services and a press service.
According to Abba Malainin, the camps are well organized and the Saharawis are considered the most educated refugees in the world. About 90 percent of the population is literate, which is a dramatic rise from the 10 percent literacy rate when the Saharawis arrived in the camps in 1975. This is also well above the regional average.
But these are nevertheless still refugee camps where there is a constant shortage of water, food and other necessities, resulting in, amongst other things, acute child malnourishment. And the situation is worsening all the time as the international aid that the Saharawis in the camps rely on has been more or less halved since the economic crisis.

Broken promises and inaction
So how will Abba’s family and the thousands of other Saharawis who live in the camps be able to leave the misery of what has been their home for 40 years and return to a liberated and democratic Western Sahara?
Abba Malainin believes that the only way he and his fellow Saharawis can return to their homeland is through the referendum on the status of Western Sahara, which the United Nations have promised the Saharawis for decades.
Achieving such a referendum, which will almost certainly lead to independence for Western Sahara, must come through the collective efforts of the international community and its influential actors, he insists. But decades of inaction from the international community has made a return to war seem an acceptable prospect for many Saharawis, especially the youth.
Listen to our story
“The international community, including the UN and the EU, should exert more pressure on Morocco to avoid a conflict that will benefit no one. And foreign governments and companies must stop making economical agreements and purchasing stolen goods from an occupied country, as this only helps legitimize Morocco’s illegal occupation and keep it financially viable”, Abba Malainin concludes.
The Saharawis are struggling and suffering for their freedom and independence every day in both the refugee camps and in the occupied territories in Western Sahara, he says.
But they need the help of the international community and solidarity movements to put pressure on Morocco and those who aid them, to ensure that the Saharawis will not have to wait another 40 years to escape the refugee camps and Moroccan occupation.

By a vote of 56-50, the government’s new ‘integration benefit’ for refugees was formally approved on Wednesday. The new measure will result in a significantly lower benefit level being offered to people who have resided in Denmark for less than seven of the past eight years.
The integration benefit will be lowered to the level of Danish student grants, meaning that a single adult with no children will receive 5,945 kroner per month before tax, compared to the current 10,849 kroner unemployment benefit (kontanthjælp) – a 45 percent cut.
Foreigners will also receive a financial incentive to learn Danish, as those who pass the intermediate Danish language exam (Dansk 2) will receive a 1,500 kroner increase to their monthly integration benefit.
Danish citizens who have lived outside of the EU for seven of the past eight years will also be subjected to the new rules.
The government views the cuts as a way to make Denmark a less attractive destination for refugees.
“The government will, as promised during the election, quickly implement a new integration benefit for new arrivals, in order to make Denmark a less attractive destination while making it more attractive to work and contribute to Danish society,” a press release from the Ministry of Employment stated when the idea was first floated in July.
See also: UN: Refugee benefit cuts violate conventions
The benefit cuts have been roundly criticized by both the UN – which argues that they violate the UN’s refugee convention from 1951 – and over 30 other agencies who say the new benefit is discriminatory and threatens to harm integration efforts. The head of the Danish Red Cross said that the hearing statement he wrote in response to the plans was the most negative thing he has ever written.
Wednesday’s vote in parliament followed a 90-minute debate in which opposition parties expressed their resistance to the cuts.
“I think today is a sad day. And I also actually think it is misleading – a form of false advertising – to call this an integration benefit because the result will undeniably be the exact opposite,” Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) said during the debate, according to Jyllands-Posten’s report.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg stood by her contention that the benefit cuts will make Denmark less appealing to asylum seekers.
“We need to stop the massive influx of refugees coming to Denmark,” she said ahead of the vote.
The parties Venstre, the Danish People’s Party, the Conservatives and Liberal Alliance voted in favour of the bill, while the Social Democrats, Enhedslisten, the Social Liberals (Radikale), the Alternative and the Socialist People’s Party voted against it.
The government has announced plans to publicize the new benefit cuts through advertisements in foreign papers."

Europe has faced its biggest migration crisis since World War II with well over one million refugees and migrants arriving on its shores in the past year as they flee war in Syria and the Middle East, and poverty in Africa.
Populist groups across Europe have sought to capitalise on widespread unease over the unprecedented migrant crisis, using it to boost their electoral gains.
The Danish People's Party (DF), which won 21 percent of the vote in a 2015 legislative poll and whose support the minority government needs to pass legislation, has backed a controversial decision to seize migrants' valuables and cash to help finance their stay.
DF has now seen its status as Denmark's anti-immigration party challenged by Nye Borgerlige, which recently obtained enough voter declaration signatures to qualify for the next election.
The Danes' Party is also trying to gather enough signatures to qualify for Denmark's next parliamentary elections, which some analysts think could come as early as next month."

But scuffles broke out with police when some ran off to avoid having their fingerprints taken in fear they would be registered as seeking refuge in Denmark and unable to go on to Sweden, where many said they had family.
Police said up to 150 had begun walking towards Sweden, which refugees typically reach by taking the train across a bridge linking Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmö. The bridge is not open to pedestrians.

With Sweden struggling to provide enough beds for the record number of refugees crossing into the country, the country’s migration minister on Thursday said that asylum seekers might want to consider “go[ing] back to Germany or Denmark”.
Morgan Johansson’s comment hardly went unnoticed in Denmark, where politicians have actively tried to keep the number of refugees down in contrast to Sweden’s open-arm policy.
Danish Integration Minister Inger Støjberg reacted on Thursday evening by calling Johansson’s comment “neither good nor appropriate”.
“Sweden put itself in the situation it is in by carrying out extremely gentle immigration policies in every way. It’s not a solution to start guiding refugees to other countries. One can hope that the Swedes are beginning to take a more realistic approach to the situation,” Støjberg told Jyllands-Posten.
Støjberg rejected the notion that Denmark had essentially done the same thing Sweden is now recommending by letting refugees travel unhindered on the way to Sweden.
“I know that Finland is receiving many asylum seekers who have travelled through Sweden. So the Swedish and the Danish way of registering asylum seekers are completely the same to my knowledge,” she said.
Støjberg went on to echo Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen in saying that Denmark will not take any refugees off of Sweden’s hands.
""I don't see us taking any of the Swedish asylum seekers,"" she said.
Jensen said on Thursday that the only help Denmark will offer its Swedish neighbours is inspiration from the more hard-line Danish approach.

“Every country has chosen its own course within the refugee area. They have chosen theirs and now they must deal with it as they’d wish,” Jensen told TV2 News.
“We know that there are some countries that are looking to Denmark and we know that Sweden has also looked to Denmark to find inspiration. That is probably the best help we can give them,” Jensen said.
Jensen’s Swedish counterpart Margot Wallström responded by saying Sweden ""had done the most per capita in the EU and we have nothing to be ashamed of"" and that decisions wouldn't be ""based on Danish politics.""
Sweden, with a population of 9.8 million, is expecting to receive up to 190,000 asylum seekers this year. By contrast, Denmark, a country of 5.6 million, believes it will receive 20,000.
While Stockholm has offered permanent residency to everyone fleeing Syria's civil war, Copenhagen has sought to limit the number of refugees by issuing temporary residence permits, delaying family reunifications and slashing benefits for asylum seekers.
It has also placed adverts in Lebanese newspapers to discourage migrants from choosing Denmark. Sweden’s anti-immigration Sweden Democrats has been inspired by Denmark's campaign to do the same, as has the Norwegian government."

EU ministers agreed by a large majority to a refugee redistribution plan on Tuesday with just four EU members voting against it. The four dissenting votes came from Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
“There were four eastern European countries that voted against [the plan]. But the important thing is that now 120,000 will be redistributed so we can move on with what it is really about, which is to stop the influx into Europe,” Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told reporters following the meeting in Brussels.
The UN and other international organizations warned it was the ""last chance"" for increasingly overwhelmed European states to agree on how to cope with the tide of people fleeing conflict in countries like Syria and Afghanistan.
But central and eastern European states strongly resisted plans to force EU member countries to take a share of the new arrivals from front-line nations.
""I want to confirm that both the interior minister and myself... will unequivocally reject any effort to introduce a permanent mechanism of refugee redistribution,"" Czech Prime Minister Sobotka told reporters in Prague.
""We also reject the introduction of quotas,"" he added.
Finland abstained from the vote, while Denmark is not a part of the plan due to its opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs, which covers European asylum and integration policies.
Denmark has, however, voluntarily agreed to take 1,000 refugees in what was seen as “an important political signal”. Tuesday’s deal left it unclear if those refugees would be considered part of the 120,000 or in addition to that number, but Denmark was not included in the numeric breakdown:

""We want to introduce a cap on the number of non-Western foreigners who can come to Denmark,"" Social Democrats leader Mette Frederiksen said in a 44-page document which focused in particular on asylum seekers from Africa.
""We want to reform our asylum system, among other things, by setting up reception centres outside Europe, and in the future it will not be possible for refugees to obtain asylum in Denmark outside quotas set by the United Nations,"" she added.
The proposed reform would have asylum seekers who come ""spontaneously"" to Denmark sent to a reception centre in a country outside Europe, for example in North Africa, while their case is being examined.
Should an asylum seeker's application be granted by Danish authorities, the person would still not be allowed to enter Denmark.
The refugees would instead stay in the transit country where the application was processed under the protection of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and Denmark would pay for the expenses of covering their needs.
After having hosted nearly 30,000 people during Europe's migration crisis between 2015 and 2016, Denmark has introduced controls to its borders with Germany, toughened its asylum conditions, and the number of applications drastically fell to 3,500 last year.

""The population in Denmark has changed rapidly in a short time: in 1980, one percent of the Danish population was not of Western origin, today it is eight percent,"" she said.
Two parties in the leftist opposition, however, rejected the proposal.
The left-wing Red-Green Alliance said in a statement posted on Facebook that Denmark would not solve integration challenges by ""relinquishing its responsibility in North Africa"".
The Danish Social Liberal party called the proposal ""unrealistic"".
Denmark's former employment and justice minister Frediksen holds a degree in African studies. She is one of the 48 elected Social Democrats in the 179-seat Danish parliament.
The nation's second largest party, the populist Danish People's Party with 38 lawmakers, is not part of the centre-right government of Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen.
But the party's anti-immigration stance has influenced the government.
The proposal baffled neighbouring Sweden's Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Löfven who told TT news agency that his country ""defends the right to asylum"".

					12:00 CET+01:00				",Justin Cremer,Denmark plans additional refugee restrictions,"Saying that Denmark risks “having so many people that we can’t handle it”, Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Wednesday said that the government is planning a “robust” plan to further tighten asylum laws.
At a Wednesday press conference, PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen said his government will introduce new initiatives aimed at bringing down the number of refugees and migrants who come to Denmark.
“Far too many immigrants are coming to Europe and to Denmark. It is increasing day by day. Denmark cannot remain open for everyone,” he said.
Without getting in to the full details of his plan, Rasmussen said his government will shorten the length of residence permits, make family reunification more difficult, further cut the benefits given to refugees and asylum seekers, and make it harder for them to enter Denmark in the first place. The PM also said that Denmark would increase its efforts to send rejected asylum seekers out of the country.
The full details of the government's new initiatives will be announced on Friday.
Rasmussen repeatedly said that “quantity matters” and that the number of refugees who enter Denmark cannot continue to rise.
“We must be honest and say that we have not have great success with our integration polices. For every extra person who comes here, the challenging of integrating them will become greater and greater,” he said.
The prime minister’s press conference came after Denmark experienced an all-time single-month high for refugees in October, when an estimated 3,500 sought asylum. Figures from the Danish National Police also showed that at least 10,900 people crossed into Denmark between November 2nd-9th. The number is significantly higher than the 3,500 to 6,000 who have arrived in recent weeks.
However, the vast majority of those refugees were just passing through to elsewhere, primarily to Sweden, which received more asylum applications last week than Denmark did through the first nine months of 2015.
But with Sweden, Norway and Germany all implementing new tougher policies on refugees and the numbers of new arrivals showing no sign of tapering off as winter approaches, there needs to be “robust” policies that he said will take Denmark’s immigration laws “to the edge of international laws”.
“Denmark is a society based on the rule of law and we must abide by international conventions, But we must also take care of Denmark. It is my government’s belief that there is room for tightening,” he said.
Denmark has already sought to limit the number of refugees by issuing temporary residence permits, delaying family reunifications and slashing benefits for asylum seekers. It has also placed adverts in Lebanese newspapers to discourage migrants from choosing Denmark and recently announced new family reunification rules for all immigrants."

					08:46 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,UN calls on Denmark to take more refugees,"The top UN official for refugees has called on the European Union to consider imposing a quota system to stop Sweden and Germany taking in a greater proportion than other nations.
On the same day that the Danish parliament discussed its criticised tighter restrictions on asylum seekers, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), Antonio Guterres, was in Stockholm calling on the EU to force its nations to more equitably handle a spike in asylum seekers. ""We are ready to support political initiatives within Europe, for instance, aiming in some situations to have forms of quota distribution,"" Guterres told reporters on Tuesday. He said that while asylum seekers generally enter Europe through Greece and Italy, nearly half of all asylum requests last year were presented in Germany and Sweden, a sign of the continent's lopsided distribution. The rush of refugees into Europe comes as the number of people driven from their homes by conflict and crisis topped 50 million, a first since World War II, according to the UNHCR. Many refugees choose to seek asylum in northern Europe rather than following EU immigration rules and applying where they first arrive. Sweden has already called on other EU states to take a greater share of refugees. Denmark saw its number of asylum seekers nearly double in 2014, but the 14,815 people who sought asylum in Denmark was a far cry from the more than 80,000 asylum seekers processed by Sweden. As Europe struggles to keep up with the influx, Greece and Italy have complained that they lack the capacity to deal with rising numbers arriving by boat, with human rights groups criticising both countries for ""push-backs"" of migrants legitimately seeking asylum. ""Something is wrong in the way the system is working,"" said Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister, calling for ""a European solidarity mechanism"". ""Quota systems are always an extreme solution,"" he added. ""Ideally, the system would work naturally to produce a fair share among European countries.""
Sweden receives the highest number of refugees per capita in the EU and is second only to Germany as a destination for Syrians fleeing the four-year war in their home country. Denmark’s plans to make asylum temporary for Syrian refugees and to limit their ability to bring family members to the country under family reunification have been criticised by the United Nations Refugee Agency and a long line of human rights organisations. Danish politicians have previously expressed strong concerns that Sweden’s generous asylum policies will affect Denmark, as citizenship agreements between Nordic nations allow refugees who obtain Swedish citizenship to move to Denmark without a Danish resident permit."

Dear Denmark, why stop at taking their jewellery and valuable possessions? Make them work off their debt. Arbeit macht frei and all that.

The truth is that the bill in which the controversial proposal is contained was only submitted to parliament on December 10th and will not be debated for the first time in the Danish parliament until the first few weeks of January.
Denmark's weak minority government also failed to win agreement from the other parties in their negotiations ahead of submitting the bill, making it unlikely that it is will make it into law in its present form.
The outrage is not entirely misplaced, however, as Denmark's government is indeed proposing to give the police powers to confiscate asylum seekers' valuables.
In the press statement accompanying the submission of the bill to parliament, Denmark's immigration ministry listed the measure as one of twelve points it hoped would form part of the bill.
""If you have sufficient means then you have to pay for yourself,"" a ministry employee working on the legal drafting explained to The Local.
""What we propose now is that if you bring money, the police will have the power to search for and take into their possession any valuable assets that the asylum seeker may bring with him or her. They can search clothes and they can search luggage.""
In the draft law, personal belongings such as watches and mobiles phones would be exempt from seizure, as would up to 3000 Danish kroner ($435) in cash.
Articles of ""special personal meaning"" would only be seized if they were ""of sufficient value"".
The plan to confiscate valuables is not the only harsh measure in the new law, which aims to make Denmark's asylum law -- already one of the least generous and most draconian in Europe -- even tougher.
The country has very successfully sidestepped the refugee crisis that has hit its neighbour Sweden by doing everything possible to make itself unappealing to refugees.
In September, for example, its government went so far as to publish an advert in Lebanese newspapers informing would-be asylum seekers of its tough new regime."

					20:40 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Denmark declines to take part in migrant relocation,"UPDATED: As European on Monday evening found only a partial solution for the relocation of refugees crossing the Mediterranean, Denmark remained largely on the sidelines due to its EU Justice and Home Affairs opt-out.
Migration ministers from all 28 EU member states met on Monday in an attempt to finalize European Commission plans to resettle 40,000 refugees based in Italy and Greece and another 20,000 asylum seekers from outside of Europe.
By the meeting’s end, the ministers had agreed on a plan that would see 32,256 of the asylum seekers redistributed among European countries.
Denmark, however, was not one of them. Danish integration minister Inger Støjberg said that while the EU has a difficult problem to solve, Denmark is not willing to take any additional refugees.
“[This is] based alone on the background that we take in so many asylum seekers. So we won’t be taking any of the 40,000 that under discussion today,” she told Danish media in Brussels according to news agency Ritzau.
Per capita, Denmark took in the sixth highest number of asylum applications in 2014 and the European Commission’s plan would force countries that take in far fewer refugees than Denmark to heavily step up their contributions.
But Denmark’s opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs means it is not obligated to be part of a united European solution to the Mediterranean migrant crisis.

Prior to the meeting in Brussels, Sweden’s migration minister Morgan Johansson said that “all EU member states have to be prepared to take their responsibility”.
“This is the worst humanitarian crisis in our time,” Johansson told reporters.
Sweden, which already accepts the most asylum seekers per capita in the EU, has offered to relocate just over 1,800 migrants as part of the scheme. Germany, which takes the greatest number of refugees in real terms, has signed up to 12,000.
At an informal European meeting earlier this month, Denmark did agree to take in a total of 1,000 of the 20,000 asylum seekers that have not yet come to Europe over two years.
Newly-elected Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has promised Danes a referendum by Christmas time on ending the nation’s EU Justice and Home Affairs opt-out and replacing it with an ‘opt-in’ model. But his party Venstre and the other four Eurocentric parties backing the referendum plan have made it clear that they are for maintaining Denmark’s exemption on EU asylum and immigration policies.

Denmark was granted four opt-outs from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty: defence; justice and home affairs; the maintaining of the kroner rather than the euro; and an opt-out on citizenship rules that was cancelled out by the Amsterdam Treaty that took effect in 1999.
Denmark last held a referendum on its relationship to the EU in 2000, when voters once again rejected the euro."

When the Danish government published advertisements in Lebanese newspapers about changes to national asylum policies, it made headlines the world over and prompted not one but two counter campaigns from Danish groups opposed to the anti-refugee message.
Now the Ministry for Immigration, Integration and Housing’s widely-discussed and controversial campaign is being investigated by the parliamentary ombudsman on the grounds that it may have been misleading.

“It has been stated that the ministry’s advertisements seen in isolation were factually correct, but that they leave, especially Syrian refugees, with the wrong picture. If that is the case, the refugees could on false premises be swayed into not seeking asylum in Denmark,” Ombudsman Jørgen Steen Sørensen, who ensures that public authorities comply with the laws and other statutes governing their actions, said.
“I therefore believe that we should clarify whether the ministry has lived up to the applicable principles on public information,” he added.
The advertisements, spearheaded by Integration Minister Inger Støjberg, informed readers that “Denmark has decided to tighten the regulations concerning refugees in a number of areas.” It then laid out those changes, including significant cuts to social benefits and restrictions on bringing family members to Denmark. They also advised would-be migrants and refugees that they will be required to speak and understand Danish to obtain a permanent residency.The full English version can be seen below:

The campaign was published in four Lebanese newspapers. Additionally, it was posted in ten different languages on the Danish Immigration Service’s website and displayed in asylum centres across Denmark. The Arabic version of the ad was also reportedly circulated widely through social media and a number of influential international news outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, reported on the campaign.

					12:19 CET+01:00				",Michael Barrett,"Before Denmark, 'we had a better life in Syria'","In the first part of our two-part portrait of a Syrian family in Denmark, The Local speaks with Mohamad Fattal and Dima Kurbash about their journey from Damascus to Aarhus.
A cool evening breeze and a hard ground were the least of the problems faced by the Fattal family on their last night in Turkey. As their children slept on their stomachs to stay warm, Mohamad Fattal, 32, and Dima Kurbash, 27, lay awake in fear of being caught by the people smugglers they had fled from hours earlier.
The night before travelling to Europe by boat in September 2014, the family slept in the open countryside somewhere between the Turkish resort towns of Datçe and Marmaris. They were on the run.
“We had paid to go in a proper boat. A wooden one,” says mother-of-two Dima Kurbash. “But when we got to the beach, we saw that it was an inflatable with about 40-50 people waiting to get on. That’s really scary. So we fled from them.”
Not wanting to risk taking their children on the inflatable dinghy, Dima and her husband Mohamad decided to run – even though they had already agreed on the journey with a smuggler.
“You don’t pay until you get to Greece,” explains Mohamad. “That means that if you run away from them before you get on the boat, they come looking for you. They were angry, so we couldn’t go back to the place where we had been staying.”
The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported in December that over one million refugees and migrants travelled to Europe across the Mediterranean Sea, mainly to Greece and Italy, in 2015. Of these, 3,735 were reported missing and are believed drowned.

The Fattal family’s journey to Denmark had started earlier that year when they left their home in Damascus and travelled to Lebanon, a country with a population of four million that is currently housing an estimated two million Syrian refugees. Mohamad, Dima and their children did not stay in Lebanon. They flew to Izmir in southwestern Turkey, before travelling to the coast to attempt the crossing to the Greek side of the Aegean Sea.
The night after their first aborted attempt, the family tried again to make the sea journey to Europe.
“After spending the night on the mountain we walked to the next town and took a bus to Marmaris. It was a rough night,” says Dima. “We were lucky. When we got there, we found some people who had a boat and offered to take us with them.”
Dima looks behind her at her children’s toys, arranged neatly on the floor behind the sofa in the family’s living room in suburban Aarhus as she recalls the details.
The family left the following night in a boat with 15 other people and made the two-hour sea crossing, reaching the island of Kos at around midnight.
“It was terrifying. I thought, if I’m going to make it alive, it’s a blessing. Only now am I starting to get over it. What I made them go through,” she says as her children, five-year-old Karim and two-year-old Mahmoud, chase each other around the sofa and jump onto their parent’s laps.
After reaching a beach on Kos, the family then walked through the night to reach the nearest town.
“I was carrying Karim and Mahmoud was walking. We started at midnight. We didn’t finish walking until nine in the morning. When I look back now, I wonder what we were doing. We did it because of the children, but I still think about what I made them go through,” says Dima.
“The men who leave on their own, without their children… they are making a sacrifice. They don’t know how long it will take or if they will see them again,"" she adds.
“If we had known what it would be like, I think we would have stayed. At least in Turkey,” says Mohamad.
After spending three days waiting to be registered by the Greek authorities, the family continued their onward journey. They eventually crossed from Greece to Italy by passenger ferry.
“We had fake German passports, except for Mohamad. For men it is harder,” says Dima. “He hid inside the car, in the trunk. It was terrifying.”
From Italy, the family were driven non-stop to Germany, from where they eventually travelled onwards by train, arriving in Denmark in November 2014.
After a month at Helsingør Hospital and three months in a centre for refugee families in northern Jutland, the family’s asylum applications were approved and they moved to Aarhus in March of last year. Parents Dima and Mohamad expect Mahmoud, the eldest of their two sons, to start school soon.
With Mahmoud and Karim able to go to daycare in Aarhus, Dima and Mohamad are trying to reach a level of Danish that will enable them to enter the local job market and have also attended an integration course run by Aarhus Municipality.
“[The integration course] felt a bit like we were filling the time, as there is no differentiation between people’s abilities,” says Mohamad. “For example, we spent three days learning how to make a C.V.”
Marianne Jensen, deputy head at the Lærdansk Aarhus language centre which Mohamad and Dima – and all other refugees living in Aarhus Municipality – attend, told The Local that traumatic experiences can strongly influence an individual’s ability to learn Danish.
“Many have experienced some awful things, and this may mean that they don’t sleep well, or that their concentration skills are weakened,"" she says. ""These things make it harder to acquire a new language. It’s also important to point out that Danish is an extremely difficult language to learn.”
Jensen also points to being without one’s family as a factor that makes going to school more challenging.
“Many are alone – typically a son, while the rest of the family are in Lebanon or Turkey,” she said. “This means that they lack the necessary calm around them. They sit around waiting for a phone call. It really means a lot for them.”
This week, the Danish government approved a new, tighter immigration law, which increased the period refugees must wait before applying for family reunification to three years.
“Mahmoud sometimes asks why we are here and says he wants to go back [to Syria],” says Dima.
“We had a better life in Syria,” reflects Dima, an interior designer. “I liked being a house mum there – I can give my kids the time they need.”
The family eventually decided to leave after nearby explosions smashed the windows of their house on three separate occasions.
“It was hard to leave Syria,” says Mohamad, who left his job as a senior accountant in a Damascus bank. “But there are no rules there anymore. Only if you have a weapon can you make the rules.”
“We’ve found that it’s possible to find jobs [in Denmark] as cleaners and that kind of thing and people are really good at helping with that, but takes a long time to get a career job,” says Dima. “So for now, anyway, we’re just waiting.”

The University of Copenhagen (KU) has asked the Danish government for permission to create extra student spaces for refugees and migrants arriving in the country. The university wants to provide an education to refugees who receive a temporary residence permit and those who are having their applications processed.
“A lot of the refugees who are coming to the country right now are highly educated and with a fast and targeted effort, they could be better integrated and get easier access to the Danish labour market,” the university’s rector, Ralf Hemmingsen, said.
“Refugees who receive temporary residence permits should have access to education from day one. Many of these people have needed competencies, education and experience, whether they remain in Denmark or later return to their home country,” he added.
Hemmingsen said that KU is “ready to take on this challenge” but is not allowed to do so under the current rules.
“We hope therefore that the government will adjust the rules. Both for the sake of the refugees and for Denmark,” he said.
Promoting refugee health
KU has also announced that its Danish Research Centre for Migration, Ethnicity and Health is behind the newly formed Danish Association for Migrants’ Health, which aims to promote healthy living among refugees, migrants and asylum seekers.
The initiative is a joint venture with the migration medical clinics in Odense and Hvidovre, the Danish Red Cross and the children’s ward at Copenhagen’s Rigshospitalet.
“Improved health among migrants is a prerequisite for successful integration. It is, however, also a challenge that demands a collective, coordinated effort involving many different players,” KU associate professor Marie Nørredam, a co-chair of the new association, said.
In addition to promoting health among migrants and refugees, the association says it will also inform Danish society of migrant health issues and Denmark’s rising health inequality.
“Migration is at the top of the global and local agenda, only the importance of health and disease is often set aside in debates about migration and welfare,” Nørredam said."

Responding to allegations that last week's extraordinary leaders' summit on the Mediterranean refugee crisis had produced a disappointing result, she said that the latest joint moves “were only a start... not the solution to the whole problem.”
“We said that the most important thing is sea rescue,” Merkel added, saying that the additional resources promised by Germany, Denmark and other countries were “an important first step”.

The Chancellor went on to say that the planned tunnel under the Baltic linking Danish island Lolland with the German island of Fehmarn would go ahead.
“I can't rule out a few delays cropping up,” Merkel said, “but that doesn't discourage us from sticking to the treaty and trying our best to stick to the timetable.”
Denmark's parliament has only just agreed on the law allowing construction to begin on the mega-project and freeing up funds.
The Danes will bear the €7.4 billion (about 55 billion Danish kroner) cost of digging the road and rail tunnel, while Germany will pay for connecting the exit to the German transport system.
Before construction begins, the government must work through over 3,000 objections.
Planners hope to have the 17.6-km tunnel completed by 2021, with the rail link running smoothly by 2024.

Denmark and Sweden have temporarily reintroduced border checks in an attempt to control the migrant flow, but Jensen said much of the problem stemmed from poor planning in their larger southern neighbor.
""I think that Merkel has been surprised by the number of refugees coming to Germany. She thought this was a crisis that would fade out,"" Jensen told guests at a US think tank during a visit to Washington.
""She has been accused actually of being the one sending out invitations to refugees around the world, 'Please come to Germany, you are welcome here, we have a house and a job and it's a great place to be',"" he said.
Merkel is under intense domestic political pressure to put a cap on refugee arrivals after more than a million -- many fleeing war in Syria and Afghanistan -- arrived in Germany last year alone.
Instead, she has taken the lead in negotiating a deal with Turkey to send back migrants arriving on the shores on Greece in exchange for EU help in dealing with the 2.7 million refugees on Turkish soil.
""So after being too late too little she is now taking on responsibility, and I think she is doing a tremendously good job,"" Jensen said, complaining that other EU members were being kept in the dark.
""Sometimes she perhaps should remember to inform and listen because even given how strong she can be and how large and strong Germany is, they can't decide for the rest of the 27.""

""What does the word 'enough' mean? Is Sweden full? Is the Nordic region full? Are we too many people? We are 25 million people living in the North. I often fly over the Swedish countryside and I would advise others to do. There are endless fields and forests. There's more space than you might imagine. Those who claim that the country is full, they should demonstrate where it is full,"" the former Swedish leader said. But Reinfeldt shouldn’t expect Danish politicians to jump on board with his plan to welcome more refugees to the region. “This is the first time I’ve heard that a country’s geographic size should determine how many people from distant lands can be fit in. That’s a new one for me. But space is not the problem – the problem is that we have huge economic and cultural challenges,” Martin Geertsen, the integration spokesman for opposition party Venstre, told BT. See also: UN wants Denmark to drop refugee restrictions Reinfeldt also made what seemed to be a thinly-veiled jab at the Danes’ strict immigration policies by saying that he distances himself from “those who think that security lies in everyone being the same, being homogenous and keeping out those who are different”. Mette Reissmann of the ruling Social Democrats summarily dismissed Reinfeldt’s criticism. “We are not Swedes. We are Danes,” she told BT, adding that Denmark doesn’t share Sweden’s goal of being seen as a “humanitarian superpower.” “We have the ambition of doing what is right for Denmark. It is about finding a balance, and that’s why we have a law proposal that will tighten our asylum policies,” Reissmann continued. See also: Denmark worried about Sweden's asylum influx Denmark’s plans to make asylum temporary for Syrian refugees and to limit their ability to bring family members to the country under family reunification have been criticised by the United Nations Refugee Agency and a long line of human rights organisations. Danish politicians have previously expressed strong concerns that Sweden’s generous asylum policies will affect Denmark, as citizenship agreements between Nordic nations allow refugees who obtain Swedish citizenship to move to Denmark without a Danish resident permit. Reinfeldt’s successor as Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, was forced to call a snap election just three months into his term. In his interview with Politiken, Reinfeldt also said that ""there is no place"" for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats."

A refugee distribution plan for 2016 was put forth by the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) on Thursday. While Aalborg Municipality will receive 642 refugees and Aarhus Municipality will welcome 587, the much larger Copenhagen will not take any.
Copenhagen politicians on Thursday also voted down a proposal to voluntarily take in 200 refugees. One of the council members who voted against the proposal said that it's time for other parts of the country to do their part.
""We have integration problems in Copenhagen so I'd rather pass the buck to those who don't take enough,"" Lars Aslan Rasmussen of the Social Democrats told Ritzau.
The mayor of Vesthimmerlands Municipality in northern Jutland, which will receive 109 refugees under the DIS plan, told Berlingske that it was unfair that the nation’s largest city is not taking part.
“I think it is simply ridiculous that Copenhagen couldn’t manage to vote in favour of taking 200 refugees. I think that they could find the space to establish a refugee centre that could house 2,000 refugees because the City of Copenhagen could manage that,” Knud Kristensen said.
Under DIS’s plan, it becomes the individual municipality’s responsibility to house the refugees and carry out integration programmes.
Speaking to BT, Kristensen said that his municipality simply cannot afford to take in the 109 additional refugees.
“It is hard enough to find housing for them and the empty buildings we have are out in the countryside. We would have to create extra bus connections so that they can receive an education or get to work,” he said.
“We have just decided to close down an eldercare centre and are considering closing three smaller schools. If we also have to find money for this project [the refugees, ed.] we will have to take another round [of spending cuts, ed.]. It will have to be other schools, other care homes and cutbacks in daycare institutions,” he added.
Copenhagen’s deputy mayor for integration, Anna Mee Allerslev, said that the city’s unwillingness to take refugees was “embarrassing”.
“Copenhagen is taking zero refugees. There is not much solidarity or glory in that,” she wrote on Twitter.

The scheme allows all customers flying out of Copenhagen Airport and Stockholm's Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport in Denmark to Kos and Lesbos on flights operated by Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia.

The proposal to strip refugees of their valuables is contained in a draft bill which was submitted to the Danish parliament on December 10th and which is not expected debated by MPs until some time in January.
But the furore over the plan is rumbling on with Police Union leader Claus Oxfeldt now entering the fray by going public with concerns about the practicality of the scheme.
“I don't have a good enough imagination to envisage us taking things like wedding rings from refugees coming to this country,” Oxfeldt was quoted by national broadcaster DR.
Oxfeldt also stated his belief that estimation of specific values of items was outside of police jurisdiction.
“It is not possible for us to judge whether a ring has a value of 1,000 (€134), 5,000 or 10,000 kroner,” Oxfeldt said. “If there is a large amount of cash, perhaps we should confiscate it,” he added.
But integration minister Inger Støjberg stated her disagreement with Oxfeldt's assessment.
“I think most people can tell whether something is worth a thousand or 20,000 kroner, and if there is any doubt, you can have it valued or choose not to take it,” she said, also on DR.
This does not mean that valuation experts would be brought in, according to Støjberg.
“This is about very general principals in Denmark. If you can provide for yourself, you will provide for yourself. This also applies to refugees... The Police must see whether, for example, large amounts of money are being brought in. If they are, stays at asylum centers must be paid for [by the refugee] for as long as possible.
“It is important to say that if anyone comes here with a wedding ring, we will not take it. I have said this from the start, when we presented the proposal.”
Under the proposal, items needed for everyday use such as mobile telephones would also be exempt from confiscation, as well as items of sentimental value – unless these are of very high monetary value, in which case their confiscation can be considered “reasonable”.
Refugees carrying the equivalent of over 3,000 kroner in cash would also see this confiscated.

					13:52 CET+01:00				", The Local,October set Denmark's all-time refugee record,"UPDATED: Some 3,500 refugees and migrants applied for asylum in Denmark in October, an all-time record for a single month.
The Integration Ministry told TV2 News on Tuesday that roughly 3,500 asylum applications were received in October.
The Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen - DIS) only releases official immigration numbers quarterly but the ministry’s estimate makes October a record month for asylum applications, topping the previous high of 3,147 in September 2014.
DIS numbers released last week showed that 9,793 people sought asylum in Denmark in the first nine months of 2014. With the 3,500 new applications in October, it looks almost certain that this year will top the 2014 totals, when 14,815 people sought asylum. That number represent a near doubling of 2013 totals and an almost fourfold increase over 2009, when just 3,855 asylum seekers came to the country.
Addressing parliament on Tuesday, PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that refugee numbers are approaching more than Denmark can handle.
“If we don’t conduct policies in Europe and Denmark that allow us to get the influx under control then we will end up with so many people that we cannot handle it,” Rasmussen said.
The PM pointed to the large numbers of refugees and migrants in neighbouring Germany and Sweden and said that “we will have those problems in Denmark too if we don’t keep it under control”.
Speaking to Jyllands-Posten on Wednesday, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg said that for now Denmark has the capacity to deal with the refugees.
""[October's total] is a large number, but we can handle the situation. And we have the capacity that is needed for both handling the cases and in relation to housing the asylum seekers who come to Denmark,"" she said.
""But it is no secret that I want to limit the influx into Denmark,"" she added.
While Denmark is likely to see 2015 be another record year for refugees, the influx is still nowhere near what its two neighbour countries are experiencing. Germany expects at least 800,000 refugees, with some reports saying the number could reach 1.5 million, while Sweden's Migration Agency says it expects up to 190,000 refugees by the end of the year."

					15:37 CET+01:00				", The Local,Danish communities feel sting of refugee costs,"Local officials across Denmark say the state is not providing them with sufficient means to cope with the costs of housing refugees while politicians are split on how to deal with the issue.
According to a survey carried out be television network TV2, many municipalities feel they are no longer able to cope with costs which include housing, interpreter fees and welfare support.
“We are having serious problems housing all the refugees that are coming to us. The support we are receiving from the state is far from sufficient,” Helsingør mayor Benedikte Kiær told TV2.
Under government rules, municipalities are liable for any rental costs over and above a maximum of 2,100 Danish kroner (around USD $300) that refugees housed in private residences incur.
This total of 2,100 kroner is a relatively low figure in Denmark and leaves municipalities with a large bill to foot.
Adding to the pain, the monthly state handout received by refugees was approximately halved by reforms introduced by the new government in July, and municipalities now have to make up the shortfall.
“We have concluded that municipalities are on the verge of collapse under the weight of the refugee housing problem,” Henrik Sass Larsen, spokesperson for the opposition Social Democrat Party, wrote in Politiken. The Social Democrats advocate further restrictions on asylum in Denmark.
But other opposition politicians, including Sofie Carsten Nielsen of the Radical Liberal (Venstre) party have suggested that the government could improve municipality funding in this area, according to a report in Jyllands-Posten.
Meanwhile, the controversial scheme introduced by the government to house refugees in tents makes neither economic nor practical sense, according to critics who believe that there are still enough disused buildings available around the country to make them superfluous.
According to a report by state broadcaster DR, the cost of heating one such tent camp in the town of Næstved where there are 50 tents, can be up to a quarter of a million Danish kroner (around $36,000) during the cold winter months.
“It is a lot of money to house relatively few refugees and just highlights that this is no more than a politics of symbolism,” Danish Red Cross General Secretary Anders Ladekarl told BT earlier this month.
“It is our conviction that tent camps in Denmark are unnecessary, since there are both school and hospital buildings that are empty and far better-suited as roofs over people’s heads. [The purpose of the tent camps] is certainly not to save money,” Ladekarl added."

The Danish government announced in September that refugees fleeing civil wars like the one in Syria will be eligible for a new, one-year temporary residence permit. In October, that was followed up by the announcement that only those refugee who have had their permits extended beyond that first year can bring their family members to Denmark. Immediately following the government’s proposals, the UNHCR warned that Denmark’s new restrictions risk violating international laws. See also: Denmark to limit family reunification for refugees In an official statement submitted to parliament, the agency has gone a step further and called on the family reunification restrictions to be dropped altogether while also suggesting that Denmark reconsider other elements of its proposed asylum changes. The criticism led the Danish government to include a section in its final proposal on the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child. The final proposal now includes language that says that immigration authorities should give extra consideration to “the best interests” of children as inscribed in Article 3 of the convention. Other than the new language about the UN Convention in the law proposal’s comments, however, the content itself has not changed. This led Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen of the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) to accuse the Justice Ministry of merely trying to shield itself from a potential legal case for violating the UN Convention. “The fact is that the government is terrified of being convicted of violating children’s rights and that just goes to show how far out we are here,” Schmidt-Nielsen told Politiken. “The comments don’t change the basic content of the law: that the government will deny children the right to be together with their parents by making a refugee wait a year before seeking family reunification. It’s fine that they write that there can be exceptions, but that doesn’t help all of those children who are waiting around in a war zone,” she added. Marlene Borst Hansen, a spokeswoman for government coalition party the Social Liberals (Radikale), said that the UNHCR’s criticism has “made an impression”. “It always makes an impression when the UNHCR expresses criticism and it has done so here as well. This hasn’t been the world’s easiest proposal for the Social Liberals to put forward, I don’t think that is any secret. But we did it because the municipalities have been unable to keep up [with the influx of refugees, ed.],” she told Ritzau. In addition to the UNHCR, several domestic aid organizations – including the Danish Refugee Council, Save the Children Denmark and the Danish Red Cross – also submitted statements critical of the proposal. While the proposal was largely aimed at controlling the number of Syrian refugees who seek asylum in Denmark, numbers from Immigration Services (Udlændingestyrelsen) showed a dramatic fall from September to October. While 3,130 people sought asylum in Denmark in September, the number was down to 1,818 in October – a 42 percent decrease. Parliament is first expected to take up the proposed law changes on Thursday."

The Danish branch of the Red Cross has warned that the government’s proposed cuts to the welfare benefits of asylum seekers will increase poverty and damage integration efforts.
Anders Ladekarl, the general secretary of the Danish Red Cross, said on Twitter that he has never before written an official hearing response as negative as the one he delivered to the Integration Ministry on Wednesday.

— Anders Ladekarl (@AndersLadekarl) August 5, 2015
In the three-page letter, Ladekarl condemns the benefit cuts and says that they will not fulfil the government’s ambitions to limit the number of asylum seekers who come to Denmark.
“The Red Cross is overall worried that the proposal will contribute to increased poverty in Denmark and will have negative consequences for the integration of new arrivals and their participation in society,” Ladekarl wrote.
“Furthermore, it is undocumented that the proposal will have any significant effect on the number of people who choose to seek asylum in Denmark,” he added.
Ladekarl calls on the government to adopt a “holistic” approach to the global refugee situation, in which more people are on the run than at any time since World War 2.
“It is the Red Cross’s opinion that Denmark should house its fair share of the world’s asylum seekers under respectable conditions, contribute to a shared European solution and put its talk about larger efforts in the refugees’ immediate areas into action,” he wrote.
Due to its opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs, Denmark is not participating in the EU plan to redistribute refugees even though this could result in Denmark taking in fewer refugees.
Denmark saw its asylum numbers nearly double in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013. A June report from the Danish Immigration Service showed that 2015 is on pace to be yet another record year.
Shortly after taking power, the new Venstre government announced that it would cut benefits to asylum seekers by up to 45 percent and has warned that further refugee and immigration restrictions will be implemented in the near future.
The plans would essentially reintroduce a welfare benefit known as starthjælp that was used by the previous Venstre-run government and subsequently scrapped by the Social Democrat government.
In its letter, the Red Cross referred to a study from 2012 that showed that refugees on starthjælp had “living conditions characterized by poverty” that made it “impossible to pay expenses”, as well as a 2011 study that concluded that “starthjælp pinned refugees down in poverty and worked against integration in several ways”.
The government has defended the benefit cuts by saying that asylum seekers will receive payments similar to what university students receive under the stipend system known as SU. Ladekarl, however, points out that unlike students, asylum seekers are unable to supplement the benefit by taking a job or accessing student loans. The government’s proposal also would bar asylum seekers receiving the new benefit from taking holiday, which the Red Cross said will violate their basic rights.
Ladekarl also cast doubts on the reduced benefits’ effect on getting asylum seekers off the public dole and in to a job.
“[Danish] companies say that there will be an extraordinary need for manpower in the coming years. In order for Denmark to benefit from the resources and competencies that come here, it requires that the new arrivals have the opportunity to live a life that is as normal and active as possible from day one,” Ladekarl wrote.
The Red Cross general secretary concluded his three-page letter with an appeal for “a humane and dignified acceptance of refugees in Denmark”.

The advertisement, which the group reportedly paid around 200,000 kroner for, tells refugees that “we welcome you to Denmark”.

“The Danish government has announced a controversial scheme to deter refugees. Minister of Integration, Inger Støjberg, is planning an international newspaper campaign to advertise the imminent tightening of conditions for refugees in order to stem the influx of people seeking asylum in Denmark. The aim is to deter refugees from coming to Denmark in the first place. But we’re not all like minister Støjberg and the rest of the Danish government,” the ad reads.
“We do not believe that families in war-torn countries should learn that a Danish cabinet member is planning an advertising campaign based on the ill-conceived and erroneous logic that families calculate where they may profit the most from settling as refugees. Not in our name!” it continues.
The initiative, which has over 18,000 followers on Facebook, ends the ad by saying that the group wants refugees to hear “another voice in Denmark - a voice representing peace, solidarity and human decency”.
“That’s why we extend a warm welcome to Denmark and denounce the government’s scare tactics,” the advertisement concludes.

The group wrote on Facebook that it has raised enough money to place a German version of the ad in “a large German newspaper” later this week.
The initiative’s spokesperson, Marianne Rosenkvist, said she was surprised by how many Danes joined her cause.
“This strengthens our message and it makes the message more powerful that so many ordinary people are uniting behind it. On Facebook we've been able to see that it actually means a lot to people that there is another voice in Denmark. Another voice than the one our minister for integration, Inger Støjberg, is using for her inhumane message aiming to discourage people on the run and, better still, keep every single refugee out,” Rosenkvist said.
Støjberg announced her plans to run advertisements in foreign newspapers – most likely in Turkey – after Jyllands-Posten revealed the contents of a document that human smugglers use to help asylum seekers compare the different levels of benefits in Europe.

Støjberg said that the document vindicates the Venstre government's decision to cut benefits to asylum seekers by up to 45 percent, which critics have argued would do nothing to stem the flow of refugees. She wants to make sure that human smugglers and potential refugees get the message loud and clear.
“The ads will contain factual information on the halving of benefits as well as other restrictions that we will be enacting. That kind of information spreads very quickly,” Støjberg told broadcaster DR.

					10:45 CEST+02:00				",Michael Barrett,Somalia wants Denmark to release mentally ill refugee in return for repatriation deal,"Somalia’s ambassador to the EU has tied an agreement with Denmark on rejected asylum seekers to the long-standing and controversial case of a Somali refugee detained at a Danish psychiatric unit since 2001.
The north east African country wants Denmark to release 36-year-old Abdulle Ahmed as a condition of entering talks on accepting Somalian asylum seekers rejected by Denmark, reports the Politiken newspaper.
Ali Faqi, Somalia’s ambassador to the EU, made the demand during a 20-minute meeting with the Danish ambassador in Belgium at the beginning of this month, according to the report.
Somalia has previously confirmed that no agreement on forced repatriations exists between it and Denmark.
Denmark’s government has stated that it wants to be able to forcibly repatriate Somalians whose claims for asylum are rejected. That wish now appears to have been attached to the fate of Abdulle Ahmed.
“I have literally said to the Danish ambassador that there will be no agreement on refugees being returned to Somalia until Abdulle’s situation is resolved,” Faqi told Politiken.
Louise Bang Jespersen, Denmark’s ambassador in Belgium, confirmed to the newspaper the meeting had taken place along with its subject matter.

Abdulle Ahmed is a psychiatric patient who has been held at the Sikringen institution for legally detained mental health patients for the last 16 years.
Ahmed came to Denmark as a 12-year old in 1992, and started receiving treatment for psychiatric conditions at the age of 15, reports Politiken.
In 2001, when he was 20, he was given a custodial sentence at a psychiatric unit for assault against a social carer. After a second assault, Ahmed was transferred to the high-security Sikringen institution, where he has remained until today.
Some of Denmark’s most dangerous and unstable prisoners are detained at Sikringen. Transfer to the institution requires a statement that the prisoner is dangerous – known as a farlighedsdekret – due to their condition.
Such a statement regarding Abdulle Ahmed was issued by the Ministry of Justice on the recommendation of doctors in 2001, after he was diagnosed with psychosis and schizophrenia. But although the sentence for psychiatric treatment was lifted by Holbæk Court in 2009, the ministry did not withdraw its statement, according to Politiken's report.
A message painted on to the path in front of Copenhagen's Little Mermaid statue in an act of vandalism on Wednesday morning has been reported to refer to Ahmed.

The family of the 36-year-old psychiatric patient, as well as the 'Free Adbulle' movement calling for his release, told the Nordjyske newspaper in a joint statement on Thursday that they condemned the act of vandalism.
""There must be no doubt about the intentions of Ahmed Abdulle's family and the Free Abdulle movement - to help Abdulle and to win his freedom. There have been several legal demonstrations calling for Abdulle's release with several hundred participants. There has never been trouble, vandalism or anything like that,"" wrote Ahmed's brother Mohamud Ahmed.
Ahmed’s case is already a diplomatic issue between the two countries. Faqi has previously demanded him to be handed over to Somalia and hired a Danish lawyer to work for his release. The Danish authorities have so far not shown any desire to meet the Somalian demands.
The 36-year-old’s parents say that their son is being held illegally for a treatment that is not effective, and the case has been discussed on repeated occasions in the Danish media as well as in the Somalian diaspora in Europe.
The case has also been criticised by a parliamentary ombudsman, the Council of Europe's torture committee and Amnesty International, reports Nordjyske.
Documentation has shown that Ahmed has been given anti psychosis medicines in far greater amounts than recommended doses and has received electroshock therapy on several occasions, according to Politiken's report.
A migration studies expert told Politiken that the demands mixing together two separate issues represented a “merchant mentality” commonly seen when countries attempt to make deals on repatriation.
“This is an unpleasant example of the merchant mentality that seems to characterise many of the repatriation arrangements that are made – not just for Denmark, but also on a European level,” Martin Lemberg-Pedersen of Aalborg University told Politiken.
Denmark’s Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case, citing that it could not comment on individual cases.
The Ministry of Immigration wrote in a written message that it was seeking an agreement on rejected asylum seekers with Somalia and that negotiations were continuing in private at Somalia’s request.

Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven released a written statement on Wednesday asking the European Commission to push other EU member states to do more to help tackle the refugee crisis.
""Sweden has long taken an unreasonably large responsibility in comparison with other countries in the EU, and now we are in a very tight position. It is time that other countries now take responsibility and therefore the government requests the redistribution of refugees from Sweden,"" he said.
But Löfven will get no help from neighbouring Denmark, Danish Foreign Minister Kristian Jensen said on Thursday.
“Every country has chosen its own course within the refugee area. They have chosen theirs and now they must deal with it as they’d wish,” Jensen told TV2 News.
“We know that there are some countries that are looking to Denmark and we know that Sweden has also looked to Denmark to find inspiration. That is probably the best help we can give them,” Jensen said.
The EU has already launched a refugee relocation programme designed to move refugees from overstretched frontline states. Denmark, due to its EU opt-out, refused to formally take part in the relocation plan but voluntarily agreed to take an additional 1,000 refugees.
Sweden recently doubled its refugee forecast for 2015, with up to 190,000 new arrivals expected on Swedish soil before the end of the year.
Denmark, meanwhile, received an all-time one-month record of refugees in October with around 3,500 but the 9,793 people who sought asylum in Denmark during the first nine months of 2014 is only slightly above the 9,124 asylum seekers who came to Sweden in last week alone.
The Danish government has attempted to discourage refugees by placing advertisements in Lebanese newspapers warning that the country has recently halved the level of benefits received by asylum seekers.

The head of a small Danish NGO wrote an appeal in The Guardian on Tuesday aimed at attracting refugees to Denmark in response to the Danish government’s own plans to run anti-refugee advertisements in foreign newspapers.
Michala C. Bendixen, head of the Danish organization Refugees Welcome, compiled a list of reasons for refugees to choose to seek asylum in Denmark, arguing that “I should be proud, and grateful that people like you – in need and in danger – are coming to my country for protection and peace.""
See also: Danish companies: Drop anti-refugee advertisements
In the list, Bendixen points out the following reasons why refugees should come to Denmark:
""- Denmark is one of the richest and most stable countries in Europe, and we have capacity for more than the 5,000 we have granted asylum to so far this year.
- Denmark has one of the highest recognition rates for refugees in Europe
- The case-processing time is among the fastest in Europe.
- Education is free in Denmark, and we even pay students an allowance while studying.
-Starting wages are high in Denmark, and the unions are strong. This makes it hard to get a job as a newcomer, but in the long run refugees will not be 'the working poor', as they are in Germany and Britain.
-Most refugees describe Danes as being very friendly, open minded and helpful. A new civil movement has evolved as a result of government policy.
-We need you! Our population is ageing, and there are not enough young people to take over. Industry and employers constantly warn about this. So, very soon it will be much easier to get a good job in Denmark than in our neighbouring countries.""

“I hope you will find peace of mind and a good new life in my small country, where we know nothing about wars, starvation and oppression,” Bendixen wrote.
The Venstre government has come under considerable criticism – even from within its own party – following Integration Minister Inger Støjberg’s announcement last month that the government intends to run anti-refugee ads in foreign newspapers.
The minister said that she was prepared to run advertisements in foreign newspapers that will contain information aimed at deterring refugees from coming to Denmark.

She made the announcement shortly after Jyllands-Posten revealed the contents of a document that human smugglers use to help asylum seekers compare the different levels of benefits in Europe.
Denmark saw its asylum numbers nearly double in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013. A report from the Danish Immigration Service last month showed that 2015 is on pace to be yet another record year.

Human smugglers have a document that helps asylum seekers compare the different levels of welfare benefits they can receive in various European countries, according to a report in Jyllands-Posten on Thursday.
According to the newspaper, Danish Integration Minister Inger Støjberg was informed of the welfare comparison document when she met with officials from the EU border agency Frontex in Warsaw last week. The document compares monthly waiting times for family reunification as well as the monetary amount of monthly benefits that are available to refugees in countries including Denmark, Germany and Sweden.
Støjberg said that the document justifies the Danish government's decision to cut benefits for refugees in an effort to deter asylum seekers from coming to Denmark.

“Of course living conditions – including finances – mean something for which country asylum seekers will seek out. Why else would human smugglers have prepared and published this systematic breakdown of countries including Denmark on a website where they provide services based on this kind of information,” Støjberg wrote in a Facebook post that included a screenshot of the comparison document.

The document compares conditions in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, telling asylum seekers how much money they can expect, the type of accommodation they will find and how long it will take to obtain residency.
A spokesperson for Frontex said that the organization is not certain if the welfare comparison document in question is still in circulation but said that some groups of asylum seekers seem to have a lot of information about the conditions in individual European countries.
“We know that human smugglers gather this information and pass it on as part of a package to their potential customers,” Ewa Moncure told Jyllands-Posten.
The Local has reached out to Frontex for comment.
News of the welfare comparison document was seen by Denmark’s centre-right parties as proof that the nation’s generous welfare system functions as a magnet for potential refugees.
“This confirms one’s suspicions that there are human strugglers who have their eyes on the conditions in those countries in which they help asylum seekers reach,” the Danish People’s Party spokesman Peter Skaarup told Jyllands-Posten.
Skaarup, whose party last week proposed releasing a video meant to scare refugees away from Denmark, said that criticism of the government’s cuts to welfare benefits for refugees now “ring hollow” in light of the document’s surfacing.

Others however continued to insist that the influx of refugees into Denmark has little to do with the national welfare system and everything to do with the fact that there are currently more refugees in the world than at any other time since World War II.
“There isn’t a single expert who can document that there is a connection between the number of refugees a country receives and the benefits it offers. The influx into Denmark mirrors the international stream of refugees,” Social Liberals (Radikale) spokesman Andreas Steenberg told Jyllands-Posten.
Denmark saw its asylum numbers nearly double in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013. A report from the Danish Immigration Service last month showed that 2015 is on pace to be yet another record year.

Shortly after the new Venstre government took power, it announced that the unemployment welfare benefits that asylum seekers were entitled to under the previous government will be replaced by a new – and significantly lower – so-called ‘integration benefit’. A single adult with no children will receive 5,945 kroner per month before tax, compared to the current 10,849 kroner unemployment benefit – a 45 percent cut.
Støjberg said again on Thursday that additional restrictions are on their way.
“Something is coming on general living conditions and something is coming on family reunification,” she told Jyllands-Posten."

Finn Andersen, the acting head of PET, used a Tuesday press conference to dampen fears that terrorists could be sneaking in to Denmark disguised as refugees.
“Based on the intelligence we have, we don't believe that organized militant groups will use human smugglers or refugee routes in an attempt to get terrorists into Denmark – simply because the route is not desirable,” Andersen said at a joint press conference with Justice Minister Søren Pind and the head of the Danish National Police (Rigspolitiet) Jens Henrik Højbjerg.
The fear that militants are among the refugees currently entering Europe in record numbers has been an oft-repeated theme in online forums and the terror group Isis has also claimed to have sent thousands of militants into Europe disguised as refugees.
But PET said that its intelligence points to Isis's claims as “misdirection” and that the majority of the refugees and migrants are actually fleeing from militant Islamic movements and therefore unlikely to have sympathy for Isis or similar groups.
“But it of course cannot be rejected that among the refugees will be individuals who sympathize with Islamic propaganda,” Andersen added.
Pind used the Tuesday press conference to accuse the media for overstating the refugee situation in Denmark, where some 12,400 refugees have entered since September 6th.
“Today there is order and security in the entire country. Also in the borer areas. Look out the windows yourself and stop watching so much TV2 News,” the justice minister said.
Of the estimated 12,400 refugees who have entered Denmark in the past 17 days, only around 1,500 have sought asylum. The others have continued their journeys on to Sweden, Norway and Finland."

Denmark wants to put more emphasis on ‘the ability to integrate’ into its acceptance of roughly 500 annual UNHCR quota refugees, Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told Jyllands-Posten.
“It is completely crazy not to take those refugees who have the best chances of fitting in in Denmark. There should be more consideration of the qualifications in regards to whether they can learn the language, take an education and get a job,” Støjberg said.
“You do these people a disservice if they get sent to a country where they can’t fit in. It is of course also good for Denmark if the quota refugees we receive also come to contribute,” she added.

Støjberg also said that “some nationalities have an easier path to settling down in Denmark than others” and pointed to integration problems with Somalis.
Denmark is one of 28 countries worldwide that participates in the UNHCR Resettlement Program, and currently receives the fifth highest number of resettled refugees in Europe. According to the UNHCR, less than one percent “of the 14.4 million refugees of concern to UNHCR around the world” are submitted for resettlement through the programme.
According to the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen), Denmark already considers such factors as “such factors as language skills, educational background, work experience, familial situation, network, age, and motivation” but does not consider those factors in “urgent cases”.
Støjberg’s suggestion to focus more on refugees’ ability to integrate was roundly criticized by parties on the left.
“It goes against the whole thought behind the refugee quota system if one looks at who can contribute the most to the Danish bottom line rather than who needs the most protection,” Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) spokeswoman Johanne Schmidt-Nielsen told Jyllands-Posten.
Zenia Stampe of the Social Liberals (Radikale) went even further with her criticism.
""Does Inger Støjberg think that refugee camps are some sort of job centre where the rich countries can come and hand-pick the smartest individuals? Sort of like the old days in which slaves were set up in a row so that potential buyers could weigh and measure those they wished to import?"" Stampe wrote on Facebook.
The Danish Refugee Council (Dansk Flygtningehjælp) encouraged the government to remain flexible in its acceptance of quota refugees.
“It’s good to want to give those who come here a good existence. But it is in principle worrying that you risk leaving a group behind in the camps who no one will protect,” the council’s general secretary, Anders Kamm, told Jyllands-Posten.

After narrowly missing out on being named president of the European Council and having previously been floated as a candidate for the next UN secretary general, former PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt may have finally found her ticket out of Denmark.
Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said on Friday that the government has nominated Thorning-Schmidt as Denmark’s official candidate to replace former Portuguese PM António Guterres as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Guterres has held the position since 2005.
""The full dedication of the UNHCR is highly needed in the many current refugee situations spurred by global conflicts. The aid provided by the UNHCR regionally is essential in handling the current refugee crisis,"" Rasmussen said.
""In my contacts with the UN Secretary General, I have emphasized Mrs. Helle Thorning-Schmidt as a possible, strong representative for the UNHCR with great political leadership experience and a strong international profile,"" he added.
If Thorning-Schmidt lands the appointment, she would follow in the footsteps of Poul Hartling, who served as Denmark’s prime minister from 1973 to 1975 and held the high commissioner post from 1978 to 1985. In 1981, he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the UNHCR, the second time the office was given the prestigious honour.

Thorning-Schmidt was Denmark’s first ever female prime minister, holding the office from September 2011 until June 2015. Following her election night defeat to current PM Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Thorning-Schmidt stepped down as the political leader of the Social Democrats.
TV2’s political analyst Anders Langballe said Thorning-Schmidt’s chances for getting the UNHCR post were good.
“Thorning has an international profile and a foundation as a former prime minister. There is a certain understanding, at least within the Danish diplomatic corps, that it is Scandinavia’s turn to fill this post. With Helle Thorning’s experience, they reckon that she is an obvious candidate,” Langballe said.
If Thorning-Schmidt gets the job, she will be in charge of a staff of over 7,600 workers across 125 countries whose primary task is to protect and assist refugees around the world.
Andreas Kamm, the general secretary of the Danish Refugee Council, said he fully supported Thorning-Schmidt's candidacy.

					11:57 CEST+02:00				",Michael Barrett,Denmark rejected asylum seekers hunger strike against 'intolerable' circumstances,"A group of 28 Kurdish and Iranian asylum seekers who are residents at a deportation centre in Denmark have been on hunger strike for the last eight days.
The hunger strikers hope to call attention to what they feel is an intolerable situation with no clear solution, a resident at Departure Centre Kærshovedgård, where the hunger strike is taking place, told The Local.
“When we were moved [to the centre], we didn’t know what it would be like. After a few months we lost hope. Everything is just getting worse and worse,” Iranian resident Kamran Mohammadi said.
Kærshovedgård, a so-called udrejsecenter (departure or expulsion centre), houses rejected asylum seekers who have not yet left Danish territory, for example due to being stateless or because no readmission arrangement exists between Denmark and their home country.
Others do not agree with the outcome of their asylum application or are unable to be voluntarily returned to their home countries due to the danger they believe that will place them under.
Mohammadi, a rejected asylum seeker who has lived in Denmark since 2008, initially at the Sandholm refugee facility and now at Kærshovedgård, said that he and others at the centre had been made to feel like criminals, despite not having broken any laws.
“We respect the rules but we feel as though we have committed a crime. It creates a bad atmosphere,” he said.
The 30-year-old Iranian, who spoke to The Local’s reporter in fluent Danish over the telephone, said that he had spent his “prime years” in the Sandholm and other refugee centres, having come to Denmark as a refugee at the age of 21.
Mohammadi said that his background as a political dissident made it impossible for him to return to his homeland.
“Some of us have cooperated and gone back to Iran, but for others, it’s not possible. We have no help here. No Danish lessons, no activities. We have to sign forms three times a week and speak to police who ask every time why we haven’t returned home. They say ‘why don’t you leave, you have no opportunities in Denmark’. It’s making people mentally ill,” the Iranian said.

Martin Lemberg-Pedersen, assistant professor in Global Refugee Studies at Aalborg University’s Department of Culture and Global Studies, told The Local that the circumstances at the centre, where rejected asylum seekers exist in a state of limbo, had been proven by studies to cause psychological illness.
“This is a very serious situation, due in part to the very rationale behind such expulsion centres. They are built on a logic that people can be motivated to leave the country. This means that the centre’s main function is to impose living conditions so intolerable that people will leave. Consequently, [the centres] are not created in a way that allows for a normal, healthy life,” Lemberg-Pedersen said.
Located 13 kilometres from Ikast in Jutland, the Kærshovedgård facility is one of two deportation centres in Denmark used to house rejected male and female asylum seekers who have not agreed to voluntary return, as well as persons with so-called ‘tolerated stay’ (tålt ophold) status, who do not have permission to reside in Denmark but cannot be deported.

Persons with a deportation sentence are also held at the facilty.
The three groups are not separated during day time, according to information provided to The Local.
The centre opened in March 2016 following the approval of the so-called ‘asylum package’ by the Danish government in a motion led by immigration minister Inger Støjberg in 2015.
That law provided for the opening of the expulsion centre – a type of facility that did not previously exist in Denmark – based on the 2008 EU Returns Directive.
Denmark had previously chosen not to implement the use of such centres due to the foreseen consequences for those detained in them, Lemberg-Pedersen said.
This changed once Denmark’s first expulsion centre at Sjælsmark was opened by the previous Social Democrat-led government in 2013, he added.
There are no fences or bars to keep people inside or outside the facility, but the nearest shop is seven kilometres away in the town of Bording. There are no public transport connections.
People living at the centre are not permitted to make their own food and must spend every night at the centre unless special permission is granted.
Rejected asylum seekers who have not agreed to be returned to their own countries are also barred from taking on voluntary work within the centre.

Lemberg-Pedersen echoed comments made by Mohammadi – that conditions are similar to those usually detained for being convicted of crimes.
“These things contribute to making conditions intolerable. This kind of camp technology places already-vulnerable people in intolerable situations, and centres like this have a track record of breaking people down. Research tells us that people reach a threshold after which they begin to break down, with a range of severe psychological and psychosomatic consequences,” the assistant professor said.
Residents at the deportation centre who feel unable to return home end up feeling that there is “no end”, he added.
“They are allowed to do none of the basic activities that are most important for all of us – because these activities show perspective and a future. Therefore, they end up taking desperate measures like these,” Lemberg-Pedersen said in reference to the hunger strike.
Tone Olaf Nielsen, programme and traineeships co-ordinator at Trampoline House, a Copenhagen independent citizens' centre for asylum seekers and refugees, told The Local that hunger strikers hoped to shine light on their situation and, in some cases, have their cases reopened.
Nielsen visited Kærshovedgård on a number of occasions before the protest began.
“It’s a problem that these deportation centres are opened with such awful conditions, because [residents] have not committed any crime, other than being unable to leave,” she said.
“The ministry’s position is that they can leave, but in reality, they can’t,” she added.
A number of asylum seekers whose cases were rejected by both the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen) and Refugee Board (Flygtningenævnet), with which appeals can be lodged, have previously succeeded in having their cases reopened after receiving legal assistance, Nielsen said.
This shows that incorrect decisions can be made by both boards, despite the contention of authorities that this is not possible, she added.
“People are desperate to be heard and are living under these conditions, so this is their last option – having control over their own deaths,” she said.
Many of the centre’s residents have – like Mohammadi – lived in Denmark long enough to establish a strong connection to the country, Nielsen said.
“The interned people can have connections to Denmark related to their long stays – they have families and children. It takes a long time – sometimes seven to nine years – to come through the system. But now it’s not possible for them to buy an ice cream for their children,” she said.
The Local has contacted Departure Centre Kærshovedgård for comment.

A number of major companies based in Denmark have decided to publicly voice their resentment at the Venstre government’s plans to place anti-refugee advertisements in foreign newspapers, arguing that it will damage Denmark’s reputation abroad.
Communications director at Grundfos, Kim Nøhr Skibsted, told Jyllands-Posten that the ads will send a clear signal that Denmark is a “closed country” and make it more difficult for businesses to recruit workers from abroad as well as making other markets less keen on buying Danish products.

“The government is going ahead with full-page advertisements where we tell people that we would rather not see them. That won’t make us any richer, just poorer. So we at Grundfos recommend calling off this initiative,” Skibsted told Jyllands-Posten.
”You should consider it from a consumer’s point of view. If you see a producer or a brand which signifies arrogance and a view that others are inferior to them, they you begin to consider how unsympathetic that is and start shopping for an alternative. We have already heard this from several clients,” he added.
Administrative director Charlotte Mark at Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen echoed Skibsted’s sentiments.
“They should drop the campaign,” she told Jyllands-Posten.

Head of Norisol Carsten Hoeck also worried about the economic prospects of such a campaign.
“Essentially it’s just serves as an example of how harsh the tone has become in relation to foreigners, and it could be worrying what consequences it will have to economic growth in Denmark,” Hoeck told the newspaper.
Venstre remains steadfast in its intent to run the campaign, according to the newspaper.
Venstre MP Marcus Knuth told DR that the criticism is unwarranted, as the ads will only be targeted at refugees in and human smugglers.
""We do not believe that initiating a targeted campaign at refugees will have any influence at all on people in Canada or Australia who are considering moving to Denmark to work,"" Knuth said.
""It is not the New York Times that we want to publish these ads. We will be publishing them in areas where human smugglers operate, such as Libya and Turkey, which are two of the main routes into Denmark. I don't think that the newspapers they read in those countries are the same that are read by the majority of the sort of foreign workers we would welcome to Denmark,"" he added.
The statements from industry leaders follow shortly after news of a Danish Facebook campaign which aims to gather enough contributions to publish pro-refugee advertisements in national and foreign newspapers, as a counter-response to the ads that the government plans to run.

The Venstre government has come under considerable criticism – even from within its own party – following Integration Minister Inger Støjberg’s announcement last week that the government plans to run anti-refugee ads in foreign newspapers.
The minister said last week that she was prepared to run advertisements in foreign newspapers that will contain information aimed at deterring refugees from coming to Denmark.

She made the announcement shortly after Jyllands-Posten revealed the contents of a document that human smugglers use to help asylum seekers compare the different levels of benefits in Europe.
Denmark saw its asylum numbers nearly double in 2014, with 14,815 people arriving in the course of the year compared to 7,557 asylum seekers in 2013. A report from the Danish Immigration Service last month showed that 2015 is on pace to be yet another record year.
Per capita, Denmark took in the sixth highest number of asylum applications in 2014. But due to its opt-out on EU Justice and Home Affairs, it is not participating in the EU plan to redistribute refugees even though this could see Denmark taking in fewer refugees than is currently the case."

					10:23 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Denmark reverses course on refugee ‘child brides’,"Denmark’s decision to separate married couples in refugee centres if one party is below the age of 18 has been reversed after the government concluded it was in violation of international conventions.
Metroxpress reported on Wednesday that the Danish Immigration Service will now reunite several married couples who have been living separately since February.
“In some of these cases it has been it has been assessed that it would not be compatible with Denmark’s international obligations to maintain the separate living quarters, thus these couple have been offered to be housed together,” DIS wrote in an official response to a parliamentary enquiry.

Specifically, the agency concluded that the separate living quarters would violate the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to one's ""private and family life”.
Josephine Fock, an MP for The Alternative who raised the issue with DIS, cheered the reversal.
“It is completely outrageous. We are talking about people who have fled to Denmark who are being split from each other. Some of them have children together and investigating individual [asylum] cases takes an unbelievably long time,” Fock told Metroxpress.
In January, the Integration Ministry obtained an overview of the Danish asylum system that revealed that there are currently 27 minors who have spouses or partners. According to an earlier report in Metroxpress, there are two married 14-year-old girls at Danish asylum centres. One is married to a 28-year-old man, while the other is pregnant and has a 24-year-old husband.
The newspaper later reported that two asylum seekers tried to take their own lives after being split from their spouses.
Integration Minister Inger Støjberg, who championed the separations, did not immediately respond to the policy reversal but spokesmen for both the Danish People’s Party and the Conservatives told Metroxpress that Denmark should either directly challenge or withdraw from the international conventions."
