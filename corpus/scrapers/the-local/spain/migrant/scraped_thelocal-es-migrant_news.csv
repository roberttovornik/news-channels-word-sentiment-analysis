					17:58 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spanish migrant rescuers hit out at Italian boat seizure,"The Spanish group whose migrant rescue boat has been impounded by the Italian authorities hit out Thursday at what it called a deliberate campaign to ensure there were no independent witnesses to how refugees are treated while trying to flee from Libya to Italy.
""Proactiva Open Arms is the new target of a clear institutional, political and media campaign that wants to keep away witnesses who could denounce human rights violations in the Mediterranean,"" founder Oscar Camps told a news conference.
The Proactiva Open Arms group, which has saved more than 5,000 migrants since the start of 2017, had its boat impounded at the port of Pozzallo in Sicily, where it arrived on Saturday with more than 200 people rescued off the coast of Libya.
The non-governmental group had refused to hand the migrants over to the Libyan coastguard, despite warnings from Rome and what the NGO claimed were death threats from the Libyans.
The prosecutor's office in Catania in eastern Sicily has opened an investigation into the NGO and three of its leaders for criminal conspiracy to promote illegal immigration.
Nevertheless, Camps argued that returning the migrants to Libya, where the situation is chaotic and human rights violations are common, ""would mean sending them back to the hell they have fled.""
The NGO's legal adviser, Jaime Rodrigo, an expert in marine law, said the legal justification for impounding the boat was ""non-existent"".
""It is possible that the boat will be held for a very long time, because the seizure can last as long as the procedure, and we know how long the procedures are,"" he said.
The boat is currently the NGO's only craft in operation and its seizure means Proactiva Open Arms, which is facing financial difficulties, cannot carry out any more rescue operations.
""We are flies and they're using cannons to fire at us,"" Camps said, calling for private donations and support from institutions.
Italy is the main entry point for migrants arriving in Europe across the Mediterranean.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), as of March 25, more than 6,100 migrants had reached Italian shores since the beginning of the year and 359 have died.
In 2017, the number of arrivals in Italy was close to 22,000, with 727 deaths.

					15:57 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spanish NGO quits Libya migrant rescues over 'criminalisation' of aid work,"A Spanish NGO on Thursday said it will halt its migrant rescue missions off Libya to support operations in Spain, as it denounced the ""criminalisation"" of humanitarian groups in the Mediterranean.
Following a rise in migrant arrivals on the Spanish coast, Proactiva Open Arms said it will join rescue operations carried out by the Spanish coastguard in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Sea of Alboran, which separate Morocco from the EU member state.
It will begin work in Spain in the next few weeks and stay ""as long as migratory pressure lasts,"" it said in a statement.
The decision comes after tensions over migration in Europe saw Malta and Italy repeatedly close its ports to NGO ships crisscrossing the Mediterranean to help migrants at risk.
""The intense campaigns of criminalisation of NGOs in the central Mediterranean and the launch of inhumane policies have caused not only the closure of Italian and Maltese ports, but the paralysis of many humanitarian relief organisations, at the same time as a rise in the number of migrants arriving near the south of Spain,"" the NGO said in a statement.
Proactiva Open Arms has been forced to land migrants rescued off Libya three times in Spanish ports.
Rescue boats which pull migrants from dangerously overcrowded boats have faced criticism from European politicians for aiding people traffickers.
Last week three volunteers on the island of Lesbos in Greece were arrested on suspicion of helping illegal migrants to reach the country in an operation that involved 30 NGO members, police claimed.
Earlier this year, three Spaniards and two Danes were also accused of trying to help migrants illegally enter Greece.
Nearly 28,000 illegal migrants have arrived on makeshift boats on the Spanish coast since January, close to the total number of arrivals for all of 2017 on both land and sea, according to the International Organisation for Migration."

					11:20 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,Should they stay or should they go: Spain struggles to set migrant policy,"In June, Spain welcomed the Aquarius migrant rescue ship with open arms. Then in August, Madrid sent back to Morocco more than 100 men who had forced their way into its overseas territory of Ceuta.
The apparent U-turn has led to questions over the migration policy of the new Socialist government of Spain, which has overtaken Italy to become the preferred destination of people wanting to get to Europe.
Criticised by the conservative opposition when it insisted on opening its doors, the recent expulsion has drawn stinging reproof from activists and sarcastic glee from the likes of Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini.
When Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez came to power on June 1 after ousting his conservative rival Mariano Rajoy, he scored a coup in Europe by opening up the eastern port of Valencia to the Aquarius.
The charity ship had made headlines after being refused entry in Italy and Malta despite having 630 migrants on board whom it had saved off the coast of Libya.
At the time, Sanchez's government had also announced it intended to facilitate healthcare access to illegal immigrants.
It also planned to remove barbed wire from the fences sealing off Ceuta and Melilla, another overseas Spanish territory in Morocco, which regularly tears through the hands and legs of migrants trying to scramble over.
But this had been strongly criticised by the conservative opposition who accused the Socialists of creating a ""pull factor"" for illegal immigration and encouraging human traffickers.
So far this year more than 32,000 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea and land, according to the International Organization for Migration -- more than double arrivals for the same period in 2017.
After the Aquarius, another charity ship belonging to the NGO Open Arms was allowed to dock in Spanish ports three times.
But in mid-August, the Madrid decided to negotiate with other European states to divvy up migrants saved by the Aquarius, which was allowed to dock in Malta rather than Spain.
That was an early sign of change.
Then last week, Spain sent back to Morocco more than 100 migrants who had forced their way over the high double-fence of Ceuta in a mass expulsion condemned by human rights activists.
On Wednesday, two migrants suspected of being the ringleaders of another violent storming of the fence at the end of July were detained.
""We won't allow violent migration that attacks our country and our security forces,"" Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said Wednesday.
Salvini gleeful
The apparent about-turn has drawn contempt from critics.
""The government is only right when it backs down,"" Pablo Casado, head of the conservative Popular Party, said after the mass expulsion.
Activists, meanwhile, are fuming.
Helena Maleno, famed for her defence of migrants, slammed the measure on Monday as a ""racist and colonialist policy"".
Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo denied there had been any change, saying Spain's immigration policy followed two principles -- ""the respect of human rights and border security"".
Gemma Pinyol, a migration expert at consultancy Instrategies, said she believed the government ""wanted to make an example and show they are taking decisions, so that people don't say it's a paradise of free entry"".
Even Europe's far-right movement waded in.
""Spain is showing us how to deal with illegal immigrants,"" Alice Weidel of Germany's Alternative for Germany party, tweeted ironically.
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini (above) also responded with glee.
""If Spain does it, it's ok, but if I suggest it, I'm racist, fascist and inhuman,"" he said on Twitter.
Politics expert Cristina Monge said this had discredited Sanchez.
""He had shown signs of having a more coherent policy, more ambitious, and this contradicts him so much that it's making him lose credibility,"" she told AFP.
Badly prepared
Pinyol believes people were too quick in thinking things would change radically from Mariano Rajoy's previous conservative government, which didn't honour its commitments where migration was concerned.
The Supreme Court even ordered the state in July to take in more refugees after ruling it had only welcomed less than 13 percent of the asylum seekers Rajoy had promised to accept in 2015.
""The change is in asking Europe to take on more responsibility,"" said Pinyol.
But ""if Spain says that and no one follows, it won't be of any use.""
She thinks Spain hasn't prepared well enough to take in migrants.
""The reception system should have been updated. The centres in Ceuta and Melilla are always saturated,"" she said."

					09:53 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spain announces plans for migrant command centre,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said his government will set up a command centre to coordinate Madrid's response to the migrant influx.
The announcement came as Spain has overtaken Italy this year as the destination of choice for migrants seeking a better life in Europe with a crackdown by Libyan authorities making it more difficult for them to reach Italian shores.
Over 23,000 people have arrived by sea so far this year with 307 dying, according to the International Organization for Migration -- more than during the whole of last year.
Sanchez said the centre would be staffed by security forces and emergency services personnel.
He said that €30 million ($35 million)would also be spent by the end of the year on an ""emergency plan"" to boost the number of places available in migrant reception centres and improve the assistance offered to migrants who did arrive.
""The timely transmission of information"" should make it possible ""to cooperate better to prevent the departure of boats from the countries of origin and prevent the impromptu arrival of boats in Spain,"" he told reporters following a weekly cabinet meeting on Friday.
In recent days migrants rescued by Spain's maritime rescue services have slept outdoors in the southern port of Algeciras due to a lack of space in migrant reception centres.

At the same time, the European Commission said it had awarded Spain nearly €30 million in emergency assistance to help Madrid cope with the surge in migrant arrivals -- 25.6 million which was awarded on July 2nd and a further €30 million granted on Thursday.
Sanchez said his government would also step up its talks with Morocco, from where traffickers take the migrants across the Mediterranean, saying the country is ""key for the management and control of migratory flows"".
In a joint statement the European Commission and Spain ""underlined the importance of an enhanced partnership with Morocco and the need to intensify European support and cooperation with Morocco on migration.""
This includes the ""speedy delivery"" of a 55-million-euro border management programme approved for Morocco and Tunisia, the statement added.
But the availability of this aid is in doubt as European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker wrote to Sanchez on July 26 since several member states have not paid their contribution to an EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa from where the money will come from, according to a copy of the letter seen by AFP."

The incident occurred as a lifeboat containing 70 people rescued from the high sea was coming in to dock at the town, where Spain opened a new migrant reception centre this summer to register people who attempt the perilous journey across the sea to Andalusia each week.
As the boat was beginning its approach, officers saw four people jump overboard, in an effort to swim to a jetty opposite the docks.
Officers enlisted the assistance of a small fishing boat to quickly locate them, the Policia Nacional said, and while three made it to the shore, one was visibly struggling, screaming for help and starting to submerge.

In response one officer ""jumped into the water and swam around 100 metres to reach the location, noting that the person was rigid and immobile due to exhaustion and fatigue"".
""After turning him into the safety position, he (the officer) began to move him to the shore until a fishing boat reached them and managed to get him on board. The man was subsequently taken to get medical assistance where he was treated for breathing problems,"" the statement on the Policia Nacional website concluded.
Following a crackdown by Libyan authorities and Italy's hardline approach to migrants, Spain has this year become the main destination for those trying to escape Africa for Europe.
Thousands have arrived in the country by sea in 2018 and hundreds have died while trying to do so.
Last week Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez said that Spain and Germany are in discussions with the European Commission in an effort to help Morocco improve its effectiveness in controlling its borders. The North African country is a major point of departure for people trying to enter Europe.
""Fourteen kilometres separate the coast of Spain – and therefore Europe – from those of North Africa but there is an infinitely greater distance in terms of development. Reducing the depth of this abyss of inequality must be one of the main tasks of the European Union,"" Sanchez said following talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Spain overtakes Italy as sea route destination for migrants
Close to 23,000 people have arrived by sea so far this year with 307 dying in the attempt, according to the International Organization for Migration - more than during all of last year.
Just since Friday more than 1,500 migrants have landed in the southern province of Cadiz in Andalucia, with the majority of the new arrivals funnelling through Algeciras.
Dozens of migrants were filmed landing on a beach at Tarifa near Algeciras on Saturday before sprinting into woodland as stunned sunbathers -- some of them naked -- looked on, in videos that went viral on social media.
WATCH:
'Lack of means'
With police stations and makeshift emergency shelters set up in sports centres in Cadiz full, many rescued migrants have been forced to sleep inside an orange rescue boat docked in the port of Algeciras, or on the pavement beside it.

During a fact-finding visit to Algeciras on Saturday, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska denied there was a ""collapse"" in the system to receive migrants, saying the situation is ""absolutely under control and controllable"".
But police and charities that work with migrants say the surge in arrivals is exposing Spain's response as unplanned, underfunded and understaffed.
""The number of migrant arrivals is very significant, as is the lack of means to deal with it,"" the representative of the Cadiz branch of the United Police Union (SUP), Carmen Velayos, told AFP.
There are not enough officers to process migrants within 72 hours of their arrival as required by law, even though agents have been pulled from other tasks or in some cases worked every day for the past month, she added.
In a sign that police are struggling to control the situation, 62 migrants escaped on Sunday from a warehouse which has been turned into a temporary shelter in the port of Barbate in Cadiz.
'Completely overwhelmed'
The authorities have not had not enough blankets, mattresses and even food for the migrants who arrived in recent days, said Ana Rosado, an activist with the Andalusian Pro-Human Rights Association (APDHA) which provides aid to the new arrivals.
In some cases officials have asked local residents to donate water and basic food items for them, she added.
""They are completely overwhelmed,"" Rosado said.

Migration has become a political issue in Spain since Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took office in June and promptly agreed to accept two ship loads of asylum seekers denied entry by Italy.
The main opposition conservative Popular Party (PP) accuses Sanchez's approach of creating a ""pull factor"", but the government points out that the rise in arrivals started more than a year ago.
It accuses the previous PP administration of not preparing for a predictable rise in migrant arrivals.
The interior minister said the government was working against the clock to open a new migrant reception centre near Algeciras with room for 600 people.
Members of Spanish military emergency unit UME unloaded a truck-mounted crane on Monday to help set up the new centre scheduled to open later this week in the port of San Roque.

Faced with a crackdown by Libyan authorities and Italy's hardline approach to the arrival of migrants, Spain has now become the main destination for those trying to get to Europe from Africa.
More than 23,700 people have arrived in Spain by sea so far this year with 307 dying in the attempt, according to the International Organization for Migration -- more than during all of last year.
The country's new Socialist government has also allowed the docking of three NGO rescue ships since June after Italy and Malta refused access.
In June, the French NGO Aquarius ship, which had picked up 630 stranded migrants off Libya, was allowed to dock in Spain's eastern port of Valencia.
Then on July 4th, Proactiva Open Arms' ship docked in Barcelona with 60 migrants.
This time round though, the Spanish government has said the 87 migrants who have arrived in San Roque will be treated in the same way as the hundreds who arrive every week on Spanish shores.
When the Aquarius docked, Madrid had given each migrant a 45-day residency permit for humanitarian reasons.
Those brought back to Barcelona had also been given special treatment.

One of the Moroccan migrants suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder in the overnight operation to intercept the vessel off the town of Larache, on Morocco's Atlantic coast.
The wounded migrant -- a 16-year-old according to media reports -- was transferred to a hospital in Tangier, the military source told AFP.
The others aboard the boat, including men and women of various ages, were brought ashore and handed over to the security forces, the source said.

					10:31 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spain restores free healthcare for illegal migrants,"Spain's parliament approved Thursday a draft law tabled by the country's new Socialist government which restores free healthcare for undocumented migrants, a right removed in 2012 by the former conservative administration.
While the Socialists have a minority of just 84 seats in the 350-seat assembly, the measure introduced by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez shortly after he came to power in June passed with 177 votes in favour and 133 against.
It grants undocumented migrants access to public health ""under the same conditions as people who have Spanish nationality.""
Sanchez's conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy withdrew the right to public healthcare for undocumented migrants in 2012 as part of a programme of spending cuts as Spain grappled with a financial crisis.
Several regional governments responded by giving undocumented migrants access to healthcare and Rajoy's government in 2015 reinstated access to emergency healthcare.
""Health does not know borders, identity papers, or work permits,"" Health Minister Carmen Monton told lawmakers before the measure was voted on.
Sanchez, who came to power after ousting Rajoy in a no-confidence vote, made global headlines in June by offering to take in a rescue ship that was drifting in the Mediterranean sea with 629 migrants on board. Italy and Malta had refused to let it dock.

The law resorting healthcare for undocumented migrants was approved with the support of the coalition of far-left and smaller regional parties which backed the Socialists in their no-confidence vote against Rajoy.

Parliament also passed a law creating over 300 public jobs aimed at processing migrants and asylum seekers.

""At the end of the year, the tally is devastating,"" the Spanish Commission for Refugees (CEAR), which defends the right to asylum, said in a statement.
Almost 21,500 people arrived by sea on Spain's southern shores -- popular with northern European tourists -- between January 1 and December 20, up from 6,046 during the same period last year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The number of deaths is also up. So far this year 223 people have died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by boat, 95 more than in 2016.
Most sea arrivals are reported along the Strait of Gibraltar which is the narrowest passage of the Mediterranean Sea separating Spain from Morocco.
Smugglers transport migrants to Spain on rickety wooden boats, inflatable dinghies, and even jet-skis, charging hundreds of euros for the trip.
In August footage of sub-Saharan African migrants arriving by dinghy on a packed beach in Cadiz in the southern region of Andalusia in August during the peak summer holiday season went viral on social media, drawing attention to the rise in migrant numbers.
""We are suffering migratory pressure in the entire Mediterranean area,"" Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said Thursday in a radio interview.
'Focused on repression'
While migrant arrivals rose in Spain, they fell in Italy and Greece, the primary entry point for migrants in Europe.
Nearly 119,000 migrants have arrived so far this year in Italy, which has put in place more aggressive measures to stem arrivals on its shores, including sending Italian military ships to assist the Libyan coast guard with patrols and interception.
Roughly 28,000 migrants arrived in Greece, where a 2015 European Union deal with Turkey has helped stem the flow of people making the narrow but precarious sea crossing from Turkish shores to outlying Greek islands.
Both countries each received over 170,000 migrants by sea in 2016.
Migrants deaths in attempted crossings of the Mediterranean are down overall even as they rose in Spain.
So far this year 3,116 migrants have died or disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe, down from 4,967 last year, according to the IOM.
The bulk of the migrants who have arrived in Spain in recent years have been from sub-Saharan Africa but this year has seen a rise from people from Morocco and Algeria, organisations that work with migrants said.
The increase in arrivals from Algeria is due to ""the economic situation in the country, which has deteriorated in the last three years"" following a drop in the price of oil, a key export, Carlos Arce of the Human Rights Association of Andalusia (APDHA) told AFP.
Social unrest in northern Morocco's Rif region is behind the rise in arrivals from that country, he added.
Moroccan security have been ""more focused on repression than in controlling the flow of migrants"", Arce said.
Surfboards and jet-skis
Migrant arrivals from Morocco to Spain have risen since June, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said in a report last month.
""Moroccans use all sorts of methods to reach Spain such as jet-skis, surfboards, inflatable dinghies and wooden boats which sometimes transport over 60 people,"" it said.
Spanish authorities have struggled to cope with the surge in migrant arrivals.
The government came under fire from human rights organisations in November after it housed some 500 migrants who arrived in southern Spain, mainly from Algeria, at an unopened prison due to a lack of space at immigration detention centres.
During the last two week ""hundreds of people have been sent back to Algeria"" from the prison, including several minors, according to the director of migrant rights group Malaga Acoge, Alejandro Cortina.
Rights groups have called for migrants to be allowed to wait for the outcome of their asylum bid under more lax conditions, by reporting regularly to police or a court.
But Zoido has argued that there is a risk that the migrants would disappear, causing a ""pull effect"" that would lead smugglers to bring more migrants to the country."

					04:27 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spain and Greece accords help Merkel ease migrant row,"Germany sealed deals with Greece and Spain on Friday to take back migrants previously registered in those countries, in a crucial win for Chancellor Angela Merkel as she faced a weekend deadline to heal a deep rift within her fragile ruling coalition.
""Greece and Spain are prepared to accept asylum seekers who are in future identified by German authorities at the German-Austrian border and who have a Eurodac registration in those countries,"" the German government said in a statement, referring to the EU asylum fingerprint database.
The agreements were made at a crunch EU summit in Brussels dominated by the migration issue.
They come as Merkel faces a threat by her hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer that unless she reaches EU deals allowing the return of many asylum seekers, he will shutter German borders to them by early July.
New Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez acknowledged that Merkel's difficulties at home had helped focus minds in Brussels.
""We sympathise with the situation Germany is going through at the moment,"" he told reporters. ""Chancellor Merkel was grateful for this gesture of solidarity.""
Asked whether she thought the accords with Athens and Madrid met Seehofer's ultimatum requirements, Merkel told reporters in Brussels that she believed they even surpassed them.
""They are more than equivalent in their effect,"" she said.
Seehofer is head of Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats. Any move toward closing the border between Bavaria and Austria would force Merkel to sack Seehofer and likely end the parties' seven-decade alliance.
This has raised the spectre of an implosion of Merkel's uneasy coalition government just 100 days after it took office, potentially ending the German leader's 12-year tenure in power.
The German government said it would in the next four weeks clarify details of the agreements with Spain and Greece, whose implementation would then be ""regularly assessed""."

And yet his sole message to peers today is ""don't do it"".
The Ghanian in his 30s has just completed a masters degree -- after surviving a five-year trek across his home continent followed by a perilous boat crossing to Spain.
But he's also actively pursuing a campaign to discourage others from following in his footsteps.
""I went from being almost illiterate to studying a master, it's like I won the lottery,"" Umar, dressed in a blazer, white shirt and moccasins, told AFP in the seaside town of Badalona near Barcelona.
But ""today I wouldn't do it again, it's too hard,"" he said as he gazed at the Mediterranean Sea, where thousands of migrants have died trying to reach Europe.
""I am only 0.01 percent. (Many others) die along the way and of those who arrive, only one percent manage to integrate into European life.""
Having already founded an NGO promoting childhood education in Ghana, Umar recently launched a project with migrant rescue charity Proactiva Open Arms that aims to convince his compatriots to stay at home.

Over the past three years, the group says it has rescued nearly 60,000 migrants from the Mediterranean. Umar recalls the ordeal of crossing the Sahara desert without water, the mistreatment he suffered in Libya and Algeria and the death of his best friend along the journey to Europe.
""I will always carry this burden. That is why I don't want anyone to go through what I did,"" he said.

Dodging death
Umar said death has played a key part in his life since he was born in Fiaso, a tiny village in Ghana's rainforest. His mother died while giving birth to him, which in Ghanaian culture means that the child is ""cursed"" and must be killed.
He escaped this fate thanks to his father being the local witch doctor. But when he was nine years old, Umar was sent to live with a distant uncle who taught him to be a welder.
He eventually decided to go to Europe when he was around 13.
The search for a better life quickly turned into a nightmare when the human traffickers abandoned him with 45 others in the middle of the Sahara desert.
Umar said he walked for 21 days, surviving by drinking his own urine while many of his companions died along the way. By the time they reached Libya, there were only six of them left.
""The biggest grave is not the sea, it is the desert,"" Umar said.
'Born again'

After working in Libya for several years, he made it to Mauritania where he boarded a boat packed with migrants bound for the ""promised land"" -- Spain's Canary Islands.
Along the way he lost his best friend Musa, whose boat sank during the crossing.
""I vowed I would never return to the water. It was total anguish, I don't know how to swim and I thought I could die at any moment,"" Umar recalled.
After a short stint at a migrant reception centre on Fuerteventura, he was sent to Barcelona where he had dreamt of living ever since he watched FC Barcelona on TV as a child.
He slept rough for a month before a couple with three children took him into their home.
""I was born again that day,"" he said 13 years later.
'Russian roulette'
Umar learned to speak Spanish and Catalan, completed high school and last week finished a masters degree in international cooperation at Barcelona's prestigious ESADE business school.
During this time, he made living repairing bicycles, earning enough to pay for his studies as well as those of his brother who is still in Ghana and runs Umar's Nasco education charity there.
Founded in 2012, Nasco acquires computer equipment and provides training in new technologies at five rural schools in Ghana to provide opportunities so youths do not need to immigrate.

The plan is to send migrants rescued in the Mediterranean by Proactiva Open Arms to give talks at the Nasco-backed schools in Ghana about the ordeal they faced trying to get to Europe.
""We want to explain to them before they leave what they can expect during this long journey, from people from their country whom we rescued,"" said Proactiva founder Oscar Camps.
""Ousmann says he won the lottery. But in the lottery, if you don't win, everything remains the same. This is more like Russian roulette,"" he added.

Calls for probe into migrant death in Spain,"An activist group and the brother of an Algerian man who died in a Spanish jail used as a migrant centre called Tuesday for an independent probe into his apparent suicide after allegations of police brutality.
Mohamed Boudarbala, 36, was found dead Friday in his cell in a new prison in the southern town of Archidona currently used as a so-called CIE -- a centre where migrants are held pending asylum claims after they arrive in Spain.
Police said Tuesday an autopsy revealed he ""hanged himself with a sheet"".

At a press conference in the southern city of Malaga organised by the Citizens' Platform Against the CIE of Archidona, his brother Ahmed Boudarbala denied Mohamed was suicidal.
""I was in contact with my brother every day, we called each other, he complained about the food, the cold, but he didn't complain about life,"" he told reporters in Arabic comments translated into Spanish.
""He was sporty, young, very happy and very positive.
""He died in murky circumstances.""
Ahmed alleged that his brother had been beaten by police -- along with others -- inside the centre hours before his death.
Relatives of other people in the centre have also made claims of police brutality, according to the platform.
Asked whether there had been unrest before Boudarbala's death, a police spokesman said he did not know.
Spain's interior ministry did not respond to emailed questions over claims of police brutality.
Daniel Machuca, spokesman for the citizens' platform, said relatives of those inside had described living conditions as ""terrible,"" with no hot water for instance.
He added they claimed riot police had charged at those detained following protests over living conditions.
Police said Friday they had opened an investigation into Boudarbala's death.
His brother Ahmed and the platform called for authorities to stop deporting migrants from the jail back to their homeland, as these could be potential witnesses in the probe.
Spanish authorities said last year they had to use the jail as a CIE due to lack of space in other centres, adding however the prison had better facilities, including new showers, heating, beds and sports areas.
According to the International Organization for Migration, migrant arrivals by sea to Spain tripled in 2017 on the previous year, with some 21,500 people arriving.
At least 223 people died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by boat."

Mohamed Bouderbala, 36, was found dead on December 29th in the Archidona prison in southern Spain, a new jail temporarily used as a so-called CIE, a centre where migrants are held pending asylum claims after they arrive in Spain, which has since been vacated.
An autopsy revealed he hanged himself with a sheet, but his brother Ahmed, who was in daily contact with him, has disputed the assertion that his brother was suicidal.
Speaking at a parliamentary commission, Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said Bouderbala and several other migrants started a riot on December 28th.

They ""threw themselves to the ground and started self-harming with plastic cutlery they had just used in the dining room,"" he told lawmakers.
A riot ensued involving other migrants and Bouderbala was put into a room alone, as were other ""instigators"".
Around 18 hours later, he was found dead, according to a court document.
Zoido said Bouderbala had not been involved in any incidents before.
He also refuted claims that the use of the prison was illegal, saying Spanish law states that places similar to CIEs can be used in emergency situations where migrant detention centres are full.
That was precisely the situation from November 16 to 20, when close to 1,000 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Morocco and Algeria arrived in Spain on rickety boats, Zoido said.
According to the International Organization for Migration, migrant arrivals by sea to Spain more than doubled in 2017 on the previous year, with at least 21,600 people coming to shore. 223 people died on the way.
Zoido said it was very cold when Bouderbala and others arrived in Spain.
""The alternative which had been used in our country on other occasions was putting up tents in which there would not have been any heating,"" he said, adding the prison at least was heated and had other facilities such as sports equipment.
Earlier this month, authorities vacated Archidona, which will soon open as a fully-fledged jail.
Zoido said that of the 577 Algerian migrants who were held in the prison, 486 were sent back to their country."

The Spanish government estimates that about 10,000 minor migrants are living in Spain without their families -- 70 percent of them from Morocco.
The issue was discussed during a bilateral meeting held in Essaouira on Morocco's Atlantic coast on September 14th, a spokesman for Spain's interior ministry said.
Spain's secretary of state for migration, Consuelo Rumi, ""perceived a willingness"" on the part of Morocco to repatriate unaccompanied minors living in Spain during the talks, the spokesman told AFP.
""There is no concrete plan yet, this is part of negotiations, of a diplomatic process,"" he added.
The roughly 10,000 minor migrants in Spain are under the protection of the regions or cities where they arrive, mainly the southern region of Andalusia and the overseas territories of Ceuta and Melilla in northern Africa.

Spain's central government wants to incentivise other regions to take charge of some of them. Last month it unblocked €40 million ($46.5 million) for regions willing to welcome them.
There has been criticism of the way Spain welcomes unaccompanied foreign minors, particularly in Melilla, where many sleep in the streets or in caves waiting to smuggle themselves onto a boat to mainland Europe.
In Ceuta, local government spokesman Jacob Hachuel recently said the minors should be returned to Morocco, saying ""they are better off in their family entourage.""
Spain has become the biggest port of entry for clandestine migration into Europe after Italy largely closed its borders under pressure from far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
A total of 41,594 irregular migrants entered Spain between January 1st and September 30th, according to the interior ministry.
The vast majority, more than 36,000, arrived by sea, three times the amount which arrived by sea during the same time last year. Just under 5,000 crossed the land border with Ceuta and Melilla.

The new Socialist government, in power for three months, has taken this ""exceptional initiative"" faced with a ""rise in the number of arrivals over the past few months,"" it said in a statement.
On Wednesday morning, 49 apparent minors from north Africa arrived on a beach in the southern city of Tarifa on board rickety boats, the central government's representative office in the Andalusia region told AFP.
The government has set aside ""a budget of 40 million euros (to be distributed) among regions to welcome unaccompanied foreign minors,"" the ministry said.
Health Minister Carmen Monton said there were currently 10,000 such minors in Spain.
In April, Spain's previous conservative government had counted just over 6,200 unaccompanied minor migrants, compared to 4,000 in 2016.

Residents and associations in the northern Basque city joined forces last month in an informal network to bring food and clothes for the migrants after they were alarmed at the increase, said Bibi Liras, an activist.
She said that as a border town, Irun has always seen a drip-drip of migrants waiting to cross into France.
But there has been a marked increase since last month, she said Thursday, the same day as 87 migrants rescued off Libya arrived in the southern port of San Roque on board an NGO charity ship.
""It started to be unusual when we saw they were starting to sleep in the train station or in places where cars were parked,"" she told AFP.
Liras said Irun now sees an average of around 40 migrants a day, from just four to five previously.
The Red Cross says it manages a shelter in Irun that takes in 24 people, as well as three other such establishments in the rest of the Basque Country.

Altogether, they have room for 177 people, a spokesman said, and they are allowed to stay three nights, sometimes four.
He added the Red Cross attended to nearly 1,600 people in the region over the past two months.
Marked rise but manageable
Those in Irun who don't find a place in a shelter, or don't want to stay there, are taken care of by the network of volunteers who cook them meals and give them clothes, said Liras.
A dance institute also lends its showers to those who need it.
But they have nowhere to stay, and many sleep rough at the railway station.

A source with the Basque government, who refused to be named, said the number of migrants coming to the northern region had ""risen a lot in the past two weeks.""
But he cautions the numbers are still manageable.
""We're not talking about hundreds.""
Many of the migrants are heading to France or Belgium where they have family or friends, he said.
They come from sub-Saharan Africa, from countries like Ghana or Guinea.
But crossing into France is tough. Authorities there have an agreement with Spain that they can quickly return any migrants they catch on the border, or who have been in France less than four hours, the Basque government said this week in a statement.
This has been criticised by associations that argue they should be allowed to move freely within the European Union.
Those who have been in France longer than four hours are entitled, by law, to a lawyer and the process to return them to Spain will take longer, said the government source.

It was unclear whether those arrested had been involved in drug trafficking and decided to change track, or if they had merely got hold of the vessels for their operations.
A Civil Guard police union warned last month that narcos in the country's south had entered the lucrative trade of migrant trafficking, as more and more people try to reach Europe from Africa via Spain.
Police said the four detained allegedly led a gang in Ceuta that took Algerians who had already arrived in the overseas territory located in northern Morocco across the Mediterranean to the mainland.
Police said the gang charged between 1,800 and 2,000 euros per person for the trip, earning a profit of around 26,000 euros per vessel.
""Such were the profits of the organisation that its members found it better to devote themselves to this criminal field rather than that related to drugs,"" they added in a statement.
Close to 40,600 migrants have reached Spain by sea since the start of the year with another 398 dying in the process, according to the latest figures of the International Organization for Migration.
That's more than triple the amount of people who arrived at the same period last year.

Ousman Umar, who made a five-year journey from Ghana to Spain, said it was ""impossible"" to travel thousands of kilometres (miles) from sub-Saharan Africa through deserts and other inhospitable areas without the aid of gangs.
""There is almost no chance of reaching Europe illegally"" without paying traffickers, Robert Crepinko, the head of the human smuggling unit at Europol, the European Union's policing arm, told AFP.
Ninety percent of migrants who enter Europe are helped by human traffickers, he added, citing a 2015 study.

""The journey can last one year, two years, depending on the ring and the funds you have, because the trafficking networks will take you as far as you can pay,"" Jose Nieto Barroso of the national police's human smuggling unit UCRIF told AFP.
Migrants gather in Morocco because ""it's the best place to wait for the right moment to cross"" over to Spain, said Nieto Barroso.
The vast majority pay for a spot on an inflatable dinghy or to take part in a mass run on the heavily fortified border fences that surround Ceuta and Melilla, two tiny Spanish territories in North Africa that share the EU's only land borders with Africa.
Up to €5,000
Human traffickers charge 18 euros ($21) to try to scale the border fences, 200-700 euros to join a packed boat to cross the narrow Strait of Gibraltar separating Spain from Morocco by just 15 kilometres (nine miles) at its narrowest point, or up to 5,000 euros to make the trip by jet ski, according to Spanish police.
Europol estimates migrants pay on average €3,000-5,000 for a complete trip to Europe.
Once in Spain, many want to move on to wealthier northern European countries like Britain, France and Germany where they believe they will have better opportunities, or because they already have family there.
Once again, human traffickers play a role in getting them there.
The smugglers promise migrants they will be rescued at sea by the Spanish coast guard and then taken to migrant reception centres where ""in three or four days members of the network will be in the area and get you out,"" Nieto Barroso said.
The gang will then take the migrants to another country or, in worst-case scenarios, pass them on to other gangs that exploit them.
'Chaotic' reception

Women are sometimes forced into prostitution while men are used as slave labour in agriculture or made to beg in the streets.
The rings ""supply people. They say: 'I have 8, 12, 15 people from the sub-Sahara who can be put to work',"" said Nieto Barroso.
Gangs take advantage of the ""brutal collapse"" of overcrowded migrant reception centres, and gain access to migrants through nonprofit organisations which work with the newcomers, he added.
Paloma Favieres of the Spanish Committee for Refugee Aid (CEAR) denounced the reception Spain gives migrants as ""chaotic"".
She said she notifies police whenever she believes a migrant is at risk of falling prey to human traffickers but stressed it was up to police ""to fight against crime"".
""I don't get any help from the police,"" she told AFP.
With migrant arrivals to Spain's southern shores on the rise, more of them are heading north to the border town of Irun, some sleeping rough as they wait to cross into neighbouring France, or to Santander, where police in August arrested two people for hiding migrants in their vehicle which was going to board a ferry bound for Britain.
Police smashed 25 human trafficking rings in Spain last year but many more remain active in Africa, recruiting more migrants.

A year later, he met Oscar Camps, founder of Proactiva Open Arms, and decided he would go on one of their missions when his sporting agenda permitted.
In the video, he said the ship he was on overheard a radio conversation between a merchant ship and Libyan coastguards over a vessel in distress on Monday evening.
But no rescue appeared to be taking place so after six to eight hours his ship set sail for the place where the vessel in distress was thought to be.
""At two in the morning a search protocol was initiated until the Open Arms spotted the raft, which was half sunk,"" he said.
The NGO's two ships are now heading back to the Spanish port of Palma de Mallorca, where they are expected to arrive on Saturday morning.

""Police have opened an investigation to shed light on the death of the detainee, aged 36 and of Algerian citizenship,"" police said in a statement.
The man, who has not been identified, was found dead by staff Friday in his cell in a brand-new prison in the southern Spanish town of Archidona, near Malaga.
According to a police source, the man could not be revived. He had been placed in detention from November 20th to January 18th.
Migrants who arrive in Spain by boat are usually initially detained in police facilities for identification and processing before being sent to an immigration detention centre while their asylum claim is processed.
But the Spanish government has been housing nearly 500 migrants -- most of them Algerian -- in jails due to a lack of space at immigration detention centres, despite criticism from rights groups.
Authorities said the prison in Archidona had better facilities, including new showers, heating, beds and sports areas that could better accommodate migrants.
The prison is set to open its doors to prisoners next year.
The Jesuit Migration Service, which aids migrants at these centres, criticised the decision, saying it violated ""rights and constitutional guarantees"" and ""unfairly criminalises people"".
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), migrant arrivals by sea to Spain tripled in 2017 on the previous year, with almost 21,500 people arrivals between January 1st and December 20th, up from 6,046 during the same period last year.
The number of deaths is also up. So far this year 223 people have died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain by boat, 95 more than in 2016.

Some 20 other migrants survived the crossing.
The Canary Islands archipelago off the coast of Morocco were once a prized destination for migrants hoping to reach Spain's shores and access Europe to begin new lives.
But migrants are increasingly favouring the so-called western Mediterranean trail, which sees migrants making the sea crossing between north Africa and southern mainland Spain.
A total of 1,916 migrants have reached Europe by sea since the beginning of the year, according to the International Organization for Migration, and a further 194 died or disappeared during the crossings."

'Numbers exploding'
South of Melilla in the Moroccan coastal town of Nador, groups of young men gather on sidewalks, killing time watching busses and trucks en route to the autonomous Spanish city.
""Since the beginning of the year, the number of Moroccans like them looking to migrate has exploded in Nador,"" a Melilla resident tells AFP.

According to Kattouf, leaving has become ""easier"" and is done ""often with out an intermediary... (the migrants) pitching in to buy a boat motor in front of everyone"".
A lack of official data means the actual number of Moroccans making dangerous and sometimes deadly bids to reach Europe is unknown.
Since early 2018, Spain has logged more than 38,000 arrivals, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

For their part, Moroccan authorities say that since January they have prevented 54,000 attempts to reach Europe. According to figures from the government spokesman, these included 7,100 Moroccans up to the end of August.
For weeks, Moroccan social media networks have been inundated with videos showing smiling youth brandishing the victorious V with their fingers as they board small rubber boats headed illegally for Spain.
Posts on Facebook advertise crossings to Europe for 7,000 dirhams (€630).
On its website, Moroccan Weekly TelQuel has dubbed the digital push illegal migration ""Harraga 2.0"".
'Isolated, marginalised'
On Wednesday, Morocco's interior ministry sent a memo to local media warning against videos ""fundamentally intended to mislead public opinion"" and announcing the launch of an investigation.
The same day, a new video appeared showing three activists from Morocco's northern Rif region on a makeshift boat.
According to the AMDH's Kattouf, most Moroccans trying to reach Europe come from that area, which has been wracked by protests in 2016 and 2017 over its marginalisation.
""There is a lack of confidence in the projects announced (for the Rif), and an atmosphere of despair has been accentuated by the severe sentences handed to the movement's political detainees,"" said Kattouf.
In June, activists put on trial for links to the region's social protests were handed sentences of up to 20 years.
Home to one of the continent's most developed economies, Morocco remains marred by major social inequalities, according to official statistics.

Young people in the kingdom, who make up a third of its population, have been particularly marginalised.
Some 27.5 percent of 15 to 24-year-olds -- nearly 1.7 million people -- are not at school, are unemployed or lack any skills.
More than one out of every five migrants in Morocco is under the age of 19, according to the IOM.

Both times he was caught by Spanish authorities and expelled. But he is not about to give up.

The Aquarius migrants rescued off Libya's coast last weekend were left in high-seas limbo after Italy and Malta bickered over who should accept them, sparking a major migration row.
Spain eventually agreed to take them in.
""We call on all other countries to follow suit in helping those in need in the name of the one fundamental principle, which is one humanity which we all share,"" As Sy said.
He recalled that one-third of Lebanon's population is made up of refugees, with another one million refugees in Jordan and three million in Turkey.

France to take some migrants from Aquarius rescue ship
What next for Aquarius migrants in Spain?
Game changer?
Spain's new Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez offered Monday to allow the Aquarius to dock in Valencia ""to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe"" and ""comply with our human rights obligations"".
The migrants, most of them from Africa, were welcomed by a team of more than 2,000 people, including 470 translators and 1,000 Red Cross volunteers who distributed basic items such as blankets, clothes and hygiene kits.
As Sy said the Aquarius case could change the way Europe handles migration.
""If people sustain the efforts that are being made and we do not see a one-off operation, it could be a game changer,"" he said.
""Be it in Valencia or anywhere else where we have witnessed people arriving, we have seen people spontaneously come out to help. I think when people see more and more the benefit of helping others, that can alleviate fears and misunderstandings, and misinterpretations for political... games,"" he added.
""What matters at the end of the day is the humanitarian support and assistance.""
He also hailed France's offer to accept Aquarius migrants who meet the criteria for asylum.
""That is of course welcome. I hope that they can continue and do more and that other countries will follow suit as well,"" he said.
'Symbol of many others'
Hundreds of international journalists were accredited to cover Sunday's arrival of the migrants in Valencia.
""We are happy that this is being covered because it is a symbol of (the fate of other migrant ships)... Attention should be drawn to the fact that this situation has to be managed and responded to in a humane way,"" As Sy said.
""There should be space for people to feel safe, where people should have the opportunity to develop themselves and care for themselves and their families,"" he added.
He stressed more needed to be done to avoid that migrants ""do not fall in the hands of traffickers and smugglers"".
Countries have an obligation to host and protect asylum-seekers ""according to international law for refugees but also according to the principles of humanity,"" As Sy said.

				17:02 CET+01:00			 
					17:02 CET+01:00				",AFP,Concern as Spanish activist probed for saving drowning migrants,"For years Helena Maleno made calls to the Spanish coastguards about migrant boats, potentially saving the lives of thousands of people attempting the treacherous crossing to Europe.
But although many view the Spanish activist's actions as humane, she is now under investigation in Morocco for human trafficking offences, in what has seen an outpouring of support from rights groups, politicians and even Hollywood star Javier Bardem.
The 47-year-old was questioned by a judge in the northern Moroccan city of Tangiers on Wednesday over accusations she is involved in facilitating illegal immigration.
""I find it incredible that a person who saved so many lives, who gives so much,"" be probed, says Miguel Jesus Zea, head coastguard for the southern Spanish area of Almeria.
'Right to life'
Based in Tangiers for some 15 years, Maleno began helping migrants years ago by acting as a go-between for families whose loved ones attempted the journey to Spain, often calling Spanish authorities to request information about their fate.
The relationship developed and Maleno began to receive calls from migrants in boats or from their relatives telling her where they were.
She relayed the information to naval authorities, sometimes crucial to the launch of a rescue operation.
Maleno, who works for the NGO Caminando Fronteras, has helped rescue ""at least 10,000 people"" off the coast of Almeria, according to Zea. A petition against the case has been launched. It is signed by more than 200 leading Spanish figures, including Bardem, famous for the film No Country For Old Men, and author Almudena Grandes.
""We show our total solidarity and support for Helena Maleno Garzon,"" the petition reads, for ""the defence of the right to life"" and against ""the criminalisation"" of her work.
Amnesty International said it is following the case ""with a lot of concern"", while the Catholic charity Caritas is attempting to mediate with Moroccan authorities on her behalf.
Migrants aware of Maleno's work also demonstrated their support. On Tuesday, Tangier cathedral was full to the brink with migrants praying for her, in video footage tweeted by Maleno.
'Criminal organisation'?
The Moroccan investigation stems from an initial report by Spanish police suspecting Maleno of working for a ""criminal organisation"" due to her telling rescue workers where migrants were, which aided their transfer to Spanish coasts.
Spanish prosecutors dropped the case in April 2017 as they found no evidence Maleno had committed any crime.
Police passed the case on to Moroccan authorities, which decided to press ahead with an investigation, though they were unaware that prosecutors in Spain had already dropped the case, says Maleno.
Maleno's work for Caminando Fronteras has sometimes challenged the authorities.
In one case, after 15 migrants drowned in waters off the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in February 2014, Caminando Fronteras accused Spanish police of shooting rubber bullets into the sea while migrants tried to swim, arguing it could have contributed to their deaths.
Spanish authorities insisted they fired into the air to ward them off and did not target anyone directly.
'Stop all these deaths'
The investigation into Maleno comes as the number of migrants arriving in Spain hit a record high last year of nearly 22,900, according to EU border agency Frontex -- more than double the previous record set in 2016.
At least 223 people died making the crossing to Spain, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
For Maleno, the figures are a shocking indictment of the failure of governments to deal with immigration.
""They're slaves and not citizens,"" Maleno told AFP ahead of her case, while denouncing the ""business"" around migration, including organ trafficking, undeclared work and prostitution.
""Europe wants to show us that migration control is more important, but it isn't,"" she says.
""We have the means to stop all these deaths.""

""Spain has coordinated a pioneering agreement with six countries to distribute the reception of the people of the Aquarius.. Spain will receive 60 people,"" Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez wrote on Twitter.
Malta confirmed afterwards it would allow the ship to dock to disembark its passengers, many of whom are unaccompanied children from violence-wracked Somalia and repressive Eritrea.
""Malta will be making a concession allowing the vessel to enter its ports, despite having no legal obligation to do so,"" said a government statement posted on Twitter.
Malta had at the end of June agreed to take in another rescue boat called the Lifeline which was carrying 234 people after a similar deal was struck with EU states to take the migrants in.

That incident came just two weeks after another crisis involving the Aquarius which had been had been turned away by Italy and Malta with 630 people on board but was eventually offered safe haven by Spain's new Socialist government.
But this time, Madrid was reluctant to repeat the offer amid strong criticism over its welcoming stance from the conservative opposition and the regional Socialist government in Andalusia less than a year from regional and European Union elections.
For migrants, the southern Andalusia region is the main gateway into Spain, and the region has struggled to cope with an influx in migrant arrivals.
Speaking to AFP on Monday, a Spanish government source said Madrid did not intend to repeat the gesture by allowing the Aquarius to dock in the eastern port of Valencia, saying it was ""not the safest port"" for the ship.
Northeast region Catalonia responded by offering to let the Aquarius migrant ship at one of its ports, seemingly setting the stage for a clash with Madrid.
In a Twitter message, Catalonia's separatist president Quim Torra said he had asked the ports authority in the northeastern region to let the Aquarius dock at one of three seaside resorts: Palamos, Vilanova or Sant Carles de la Rapita.
""Catalonia will always be a welcoming land,"" he said.

""Municipal police arrived and chased him from Sol to Lavapies with a motorbike,"" said Modou, a 25-year-old vendor from Senegal who refused to give his surname.
Street vendors are a fixture of Madrid, and are often seen laying out items like perfume or hats on white sheets, which they can quickly pick up and take away when the police arrives.
While illegal, the trade is often the only way to make money for migrants struggling to find other employment.
Mbaye ""had arrived by boat, he was unemployed which is why he worked as a street vendor, and he helped his family in Senegal,"" said Modou.
He was one of thousands of migrants who have reached Spain over the years in search of a better life.
Spain is the third busiest gateway for migrants coming to Europe, with close to 23,000 arrivals in 2017. Hundreds have died along the way."

Officers from Spain's Civil Guard discovered the two undocumented migrants on Sunday evening at the El Tarajal border crossing between Morocco and Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta.
Police became suspicious when the driver appeared agitated at the amount of time it was taking to cross the border.
Upon inspecting the vehicle, police discovered two migrants; one hidden in a secret compartment inside the engine casing and another in a compartment ""practically under the vehicle's back seat"" according to a statement released by the Civil Guard.
Both men, thought to be from Conakry in Guinea, were exhibiting ""clear symptoms of fatigue and lack of oxygen"" due to the heat and fumes in the areas in which they were hidden.
The men, identified only by their initials of T.D. and A.B. received medical treatment from the Red Cross, which often aids undocumented migrants attempting to enter Spain via Morocco.
The driver and passenger of the vehicle, two Moroccan men aged 23 and 29, were arrested and are currently facing charges.
Scenes of desperate migrants scaling the border fences that separate Morocco from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla have become all too common in recent months prompting the EU to urge Spain not to immediately deport migrants and process their requests so they do not have to scale the fences.
At the beginning of August a man from North Africa died after hiding inside a suitcase on a ferry bound for mainland Spain.
The man's brother drove the car, which boarded the ferry in Melilla heading for Almeria on Spain's southern coast."

Juan Ignacio Zoido unveiled the plans to boost border security at Melilla and Ceuta during a parliamentary commission this week when he revealed that migrant arrivals had soared by 88 percent this year.
Zoido said that this year had seen a rise in co-ordinated attempts to break through the six-metre-high double fences topped with razor-wire that line Europe’s only land borders with Africa.

So far this year, some 9,000 migrants – mostly from sub-saharan Africa - had attempted to force their way into the Spanish territory compared to 613 in the same period in 2016, he said.
""There is a constant trickle of people attempting to break through Ceuta's fence,"" he said insisting that the current fence was proving insufficient .
The double fence in Ceuta, which was first built in 1999 and increased in height from three to six metres (10 to 20 feet) in 2005, ""doesn't fulfil the purpose for which it was once built"", he said.
""The migrants use tools such as clubs, metal cutters or hooks to break doors in the border fence and cut or climb over the fences,"" he said.
The Spanish government will spent some €12 million ($14.4 million) during the course of next year to boost security at the border fence between Morocco and Ceuta.

Faced with a crackdown by Libyan authorities and Italy's hardline approach to immigration, Spain has now become the main destination for people trying to get to Europe from Africa.
Sanchez said he and Merkel agreed to ""intensify dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin and transit"" of migrants, mainly Morocco.
He said they were in discussion with the European Commission to unlock aid that would allow Morocco to be much more effective in controlling its borders.
This year Spain took in more than 23,500 new arrivals, more than the total number of migrants last year, the UNHCR said earlier this month, compared with 18,500 arrivals in Italy and 16,000 in Greece.
Saturday's meeting in the southern Andalusia region coincided with the entry into force of a deal under which Madrid pledged to take back migrants in Germany who had already been registered in Spain.
It is one of a series of bilateral agreements that Germany is seeking with EU partners, with Merkel under pressure to reduce the number of migrant arrivals to her country.
Berlin still hopes to persuade Italy and Greece to also accept the return of migrants who were registered on their soil before travelling to Germany.

Britain, France and several eastern European states have already opposed the idea.
The European Commission last week unveiled a series of measures in response to a flood of migrants arriving on its southern shores, including compulsory quotas.
EU defence and foreign ministers were expected to approve the proposals in Brussels later on Monday, paving the way for an equally controversial military option to destroy people smuggler boats.
Arriving for the talks, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo said the Commission's call for solidarity had to be ""proportionate, just and realistic"".
However, it took no account of Spain's very high unemployment rate, its previous efforts to absorb asylum seekers and the ""huge effort we are making to control migration from Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal which impacts the whole EU"", Margallo said.
Under the EU's quota plan, the 28 member states would be required to accept asylum seekers relative to size of the economy, population and unemployment, among other factors.
Britain has opposed the quota system from the start, saying that while it will help with the humanitarian rescue mission at sea, all migrants must be taken to the nearest country for processing.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia have all taken a similar hardline stand, and were joined over the weekend by France.
The European Commission argues that quotas are essential to solving the problem, with Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all bearing the brunt of the influx of migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East."

The human rights organization accused Spain of carrying out unlawful deportations to Morocco and the unnecessary or excessive use of force by law enforcement officials at the enclave borders. ""Thousands of migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees, some fleeing from Syria, attempted to irregularly enter the Spanish enclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco. Reports of unlawful deportations and excessive use of force by Spanish border guards persisted,"" read the annual human rights report on 160 countries. Amnesty highlighted the deaths of 15 migrants last February when Civil Guards used anti-riot gear, including rubber bullets and smoke cannisters, to prevent an attempt by a group of around 250 people to swim across the sea border between Morocco and Ceuta. A judge last month ordered 15 Civil Guards to be appear in court over the drownings while another 24 officers are facing criminal charges for their treatment of migrants in both enclaves. The report also said that hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants continued to have access to free health care limited, under a 2012 law that contravenes the European Social Charter. Spain's treatment of Syrian refugees was also noted in the report. ""Despite the government’s announcement in December 2013 that it would resettle 130 Syrian refugees, by the end of 2014 none had been resettled,"" read the report which stated that by the end of 2014 more than 1,500 Syrian refugees were waiting to be transferred to the mainland from the enclaves. The Spanish´s government´s refusal to address crimes of the Spanish Civil war and ensuing 36-year fascist dictatorship of General Francisco Franco also fell under scrutiny. ""The rights to truth, justice and reparation for victims of crimes committed…continued to be denied,"" the report said. Spain was also criticized for the ""excessive use of force"" used by police to disperse and detain protestors and said that freedom of assembly was being eroded. ""Throughout the year, hundreds of individuals were detained and fined for participating in spontaneous and mostly peaceful demonstrations of more than 20 people."" But Spain did win credit for ratifying the UN Arms Trade Treaty last April, and ""in August became the first country to update its regulations on arms transfers to include the 'Golden Rule' prohibiting the transfer of arms where there was a real risk that they would contribute to human rights violations,"" Amnesty International said.

Just under a thousand migrants, mainly Algerians, arrived on several boats in the south of Spain since Thursday, according to the interior ministry.

Migrants who arrive in Spain by boat are usually initially detained in police facilities for identification and processing before being sent to an immigration detention centre while their asylum claim is processed.
The Jesuit Migration Service, which aids migrants at these centres, also criticised the decision to house migrants at the jail which is set to open its doors to prisoners next year, saying it violated ""rights and constitutional guarantees"" and ""unfairly criminalises people"".

The spokeswoman in Spain for the UN High Commission for Refugees said she was ""worried"" by video footage of an attempt by a number of sub-Saharan Africans to scale the fence complex and enter Melilla from Morocco on October 15th which shows one migrant being beaten by border guards before being carried, apparently unconscious, back to the Moroccan side. ""Whatever their reasons for trying to enter, these people must be respected and these images show that some parties are not acting as they should... There are people beating those who are on the fence,"" Maria Jesus Vega told the AFP news agency. UNHCR fears that Spanish police are denying ""asylum procedures to people in need of international protection, who come to Spain's southern border fleeing war and persecution"", Vega's office said in a statement on Friday. It urged Spain to take all ""necessary measures to prevent this kind of situation from occurring again at Spain's borders"". The migrant who suffered the beating was later identified by the Prodein human rights group as Danny, a Cameroonian citizen believed to be 23 years old. José Palazón, president of Prodein, the association which first published the video of the beating, told the online news site Ideal.es on Monday that Danny had survived the experience, despite rumours that the beating had been fatal. Palazón recounted a brief telephone conversation in which Danny said that he had been urinating blood and could not lie on his side, but that he had been given painkillers. The human rights activist said that he could not ascertain whether the Cameroonian had been treated in a hospital or whether he remained on Mount Gurugú, a forested area outside Melilla where many African migrants camp out in the elements before attempting to reach Europe. Many were reportedly rounded up over recent days and driven in buses to the central Moroccan city of Fez.
Prodein and other groups repeatedly denounce the returning of would-be immigrants through the fence after they have stood on Spanish soil. International and national law demands that at this point, the individual should be identified and due legal process obeyed. The Spanish government’s delegation in Melilla last week defended the actions of the Civil Guard, citing aggression on the part of migrants trying to breach the border fence. Several guards were injured while trying to stop last Wednesday’s attempted break-in.

Opposition to Spain's controversial migrant detention centres is growing, with the left-wing mayors of Madrid and Barcelona leading calls to close the facilities, which have been likened to prisons.
The debate has been fuelled by a series of riots and escape attempts in recent months at the seven centres which are used to hold people caught living in Spain illegally while officials decide whether or not they will be deported.
The latest incident happened on Tuesday, when about 40 migrants tried in vain to flee a migrant detention centre in Barcelona during dinner time.
After their aborted escape attempt, some 70 migrants rioted at the centre before police were able to end their protest without violence, a local police spokesman said.
Last month 73 migrants escaped from a detention centre in the southeastern province of Murcia, in two separate incidents.
One of the most serious episodes happened at the centre in the southern Madrid district of Aluche on October 18, when dozens of migrants climbed onto the roof of the former prison where they spent the night and unfurled a banner reading ""freedom"".
After this incident some migrants at the centre suffered violence at the hands of police, according to anti-racism organisation SOS Racismo.
Dilapidated installation
Last year, Europe saw an influx of more than one million migrants and asylum seekers fleeing war and poverty in its worst such crisis since World War II, and many countries have struggled to cope with the newcomers.
Rights group Amnesty International has accused Italian police of mistreating migrants, while France has come under fire over the closure last week of the notorious ""Jungle"" encampment housing thousands near the northern French port of Calais.
The crisis has fuelled anti-migrant parties across Europe, though not in Spain, where public opinion towards the new arrivals remains largely positive
Spain's two largest cities Madrid and Barcelona, which have been governed since June 2015 by citizens' platforms backed by far-left party Podemos, both want their migrant centres to be closed.
""It makes no sense to deprive of their liberty people who have not committed a crime and are waiting to be deported,"" said Madrid mayor Manuela Carmena, a former judge, on Wednesday after visiting the Aluche centre.
Critics claim that the steep public spending cuts imposed by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government have worsened conditions at the centres.
During a visit to the Madrid centre on Wednesday, Podemos lawmaker Ione Belarra said it was ""in effect a jail"" but with greater obscurity regarding how it is run, a view shared by many rights groups.
Police union SUP says many centres are dilapidated and have insufficient staff.
""Certain centres are very old, with no comfort and (are) not prepared"" to receive migrants, SUP spokesman Ramon Cosio told AFP.
Centres in the south of the country ""flood when it rains to the point that the detainees must roll up their trousers to the knee,"" he said.
Police officers often provide clothes themselves to migrants who come to the centres with nothing after arriving in Spain by boat, he added.
'Centres of pain'
Foreigners placed in the centres can only move around freely during certain hours and must remain in their rooms at night, according to SOS Racismo.
They can see family members but only in visiting rooms, just as in prisons. Before glass partitions separated the detainees from their visitors but courts ordered they should be removed.
Critics accuse the government of keeping the migrants at the centres - dubbed CIEs in Spanish - in an ambiguous situation, in overcrowded rooms where police violence is rife.
""The CIEs are centres of pain and police impunity,"" the judge in charge of overseeing the Madrid's migrant centre, Ramiro Garcia de Dios, said in an interview published in online daily eldiario.es.
But Rafael Merino, a lawmaker with the ruling Popular Party, rejected the criticisms, saying during a visit to Madrid's CIE on Wednesday that there is ""absolute respect for human rights"" in the centres.
The number of migrants who passed through the centres plunged to below 7,000 last year from over 11,000 in 2012 due to more restrictive criteria regarding who needs to be held in them, according to the head of the Spanish police, Ignacio Cosido.
Only 41 percent of the migrants held in the centres last year were finally deported, according to the government's ombudsman.
Many end up in a grey zone, without permission to stay but still in the country, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.
""They become cannon fodder for the job market and are in situation of semi-slavery,"" Podemos lawmaker Ione Belarra told AFP.

Spain was one of the top countries in Europe for the amount of money that migrant workers sent back home in remittances, according to a report published on Monday by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
Remittance refers to regular payments that migrant workers send back to their families in their home countries. The report said that this money usually covers ""basic goods, such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and education"".
""Remittance payments can make up 50 percent of a family's income - at the least,"" Pedro de Vasconcelos, head of the IFAD remittances programme, told The Local. ""They need this money in order to sustain the family, send kids to school, have shelter and food. And hopefully have some to save and invest.""
Russian migrant workers sent the highest amount of money outside the country at $20.6 billion, followed by the United Kingdom ($17.1 billion), Germany ($14 billion), France ($10.5 billion) and Italy ($10.4 billion).
""In the case of Spain, the story has changed a little bit with the crisis. We've seen a reduction in flows because after the crisis migrants did not have money to send back to their families,"" said De Vasconcelos.
The largest portion of payments from Spain during 2014 went to Latin America and the Caribbean ($3.5 billion), followed by Africa ($2.9 billion).
Morocco took in the greatest amount from Spanish migrant workers compared to any other country at $1.7 billion while China took in $1.07 billion.
In Ecuador, 38 percent of remittance payments came from Spanish workers, making it the country most reliant upon Spain, followed by Gambia.
The report said that though the amount of money sent by migrant workers to families outside of the country might seem high, these payments did not result in a ""significant outflow of wealth"".
In Spain, the nearly $10 billion sent by migrants accounted for just 0.7 percent of the country's GDP (gross domestic product).
Top Countries Where Spanish Migrant Workers Send Money
Source: International Fund for Agricultural Development.
In total European migrant workers sent home $109.4 billion, which helped to support more than 150 million people across the globe, the report said.
One-third of this money went to countries within Europe, especially to Ukraine, Poland and Romania.
Most immigrants sent between $1,500 and $3,200 in the entire year.
The report calls for efforts to lower the costs migrants face in transferring funds to love ones, which eat up about $2.5 billion in transfer fees each year for European migrants."

					12:39 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,"For migrants in Spain, survival means squats and odd jobs","Francis Kashamba got 10 euros (S$15.90) for a 14-hour day and Lamine Sarr survives as a street vendor. For these illegal migrants in Spain, Europe has proved to be more of a purgatory than the paradise they imagined.
""I feel like a baby, I cannot do anything, I cannot decide my future. If I had papers, I could get... a job and provide things for myself, but now I only can pray,"" says Kashamba, 32, irritated.
He lives with some 30 other migrants in an abandoned school in central Barcelona which they have occupied since mid-April in protest at Spain's restrictive laws on residency - despite the country's recent moves to welcome migrants.
Last month, the Aquarius, a French NGO rescue vessel carrying 630 migrants, was given authorisation to dock in the eastern port of Valencia.
It had been refused access by Italy and Malta, causing an international outcry.
And on Wednesday, the Open Arms rescue ship docked in Barcelona with another 60 migrants on board after getting the green light from Spain's new Socialist government.
But once they leave behind the hardship that pushed them to head to Europe, what awaits is a form of agonising purgatory, according to the migrants occupying the Massana School.
""I feel cheated,"" says Kashamba, who comes from Uganda.
""I had been told that Europe was a paradise. But real life in Spain, from what I have seen in these seven months, is not good at all.""

Paid a pittance
Kashamba flew to Barcelona in December, entering Spain on a tourist visa.
He left his wife, two sons and a small gold extraction business in Uganda, hoping to earn enough money to help purchase mining equipment.
But in Spain, which has the second highest jobless rate in the eurozone, finding work has been all but impossible for an immigrant without the necessary ID.
For two months, he worked in a carpenter's workshop where he worked 14-hour days in exchange for a bed and daily salary of 10 euros daily, half of which went to food.
Then he tried to find work as a day labourer, waiting every day with dozens of migrants at the same spot for people to offer them small jobs in construction or loading and unloading, usually very badly paid.
""Not having the necessary papers condemns thousands of migrants to insecurity and to the black market,"" says Norma Falconi, an Ecuadoran who has lived in Spain for 25 years and is helping those at the Massana School.
A tall order
According to the SOS Racismo association, illegal migrants represent around 10 per cent of the 4.5 million foreigners living in Spain.
Under the current law, they can get residency papers after three years in Spain - but only if they can show a full-time work contract of at least 12 months.
This is difficult even for young Spanish who have recently graduated, let alone for illegal migrants to whom prospective employers would have to pay both a salary and social security costs in order to hire them legally.
Lamine Sarr, who works as a street vendor, knows this all too well.
""I've been here 12 years, my life is here, I'm not going to leave but they don't allow me to live here normally,"" says this 35-year-old Senegalese man.
Like Sarr, dozens of migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, fill the touristy streets of Barcelona, selling sunglasses, bags, slippers or belts, all laid out on white sheets on the ground.
Attached to the corners are ropes so they can quickly bundle up and whisk away their merchandise if the police approach. If caught, they face a fine and could lose their goods and money.
""We're chased like criminals,"" he says.
""I'm in an illegal situation, but I'm not going to rob anything nor sell drugs.
""I only have the sheet and if they don't want to give me papers, this is the only way I can survive.""
Despite his precarious situation, Kashamba is still hopeful.
""You never know what will happen in the future. I have no work but I am meeting people and learning to be ready if I get the papers,"" he says."

Proactiva Open Arms said its vessel, the Golfo Azzurro, was some 24 nautical miles (44.5 kilometres) away from the Libyan coast at the time of the incident, well out of Libyan territorial waters which end 12 miles from the shore, according to websites which monitor maritime traffic.
But they were within a 100-mile zone within which Libya has since last week demanded that it be able to carry out rescue operations. Tripoli wants to deter foreign rescue vessels, which it accuses of collusion with people trafficking networks.
Oscar Camps, Proactiva Open Arms' director of operations, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday: ""They are threatening to open fire if we don't head in the direction of their territorial waters. It's detention, pure and simple.

Camps eventually sent another message explaining that the Libyans gave up after ""1 hours and 44 minutes of sequestration and tension"".
The Golfo Azzurro, a 37 metre-long boat which had arrived in the zone Tuesday morning after refuelling in Malta, then headed north again.
Defend Europe, a group which protests against the migrant rescue boats, also had a vessel in the area and claimed to have heard the Libyan coastguard tell the Golfo Azzurro to ""leave Libyan waters immediately or follow them to Tripoli"".
""Leave and don't come back,"" they say they heard the Libyans tell the rescue vessel.
The Libyan coastguard, contacted by AFP, could not immediately confirm the incident.
Proactiva Open Arms already announced last week threats from the Libyan coastguard which said it had fired shots in the air while telling its other vessel, Open Arms, to leave the area.
The Libyan navy announced last Thursday the creation of a new search and rescue zone under its direct responsibility, with access banned for foreign vessels.
But such a decision should in principle be authorised by the International Maritime Organization, according to the Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti, suggesting the coastguard of chaos-torn Libya do not have the
resources to patrol such a zone.
While waiting for further information, three other aid groups have suspended their operations in recent days."

In a grim reminder of the discovery of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach in 2015, the body was found Friday in the municipality of Barbate on Spain's southern tip.
A spokesman for the Madrid government based in Cadiz province, where Barbate is located, told AFP the boy was believed to be six to seven years old.
""The hypothesis is that he was a migrant,"" he said, adding that the bodies of other people believed to be migrants travelling from north Africa had washed up on the coast further east more than two weeks ago.
Authorities are investigating ""to see if there is any kind of link,"" he said.
The September 15th picture of Aylan's tiny lifeless body sent shockwaves around the world, becoming one of the most searing images of the migrant crisis.
While the focus has often been on the migrants and refugees heading to Europe via Turkey, Greece and Italy, a smaller number also head for Spain.
The country has two enclaves in north Africa -- Ceuta and Melilla -- surrounded by high barriers that are regularly stormed by migrants.
Others, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa, take to rickety boats to try to cross the narrow stretch of sea between Spain's southern tip and Morocco.
According to the International Organization for Migration, 13,246 migrants arrived in Spain last year, more than 8,100 of whom came by sea.
This compares to the more than 181,000 and close to 177,000 who arrived in Italy and Greece respectively."

					08:49 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Case dropped against police who beat migrant,"A human rights group vowed Wednesday to appeal after a Spanish court dismissed a case against eight police who beat a migrant trying to illegally enter Spain's north African territory of Melilla.
Footage of the incident, which took place in October 2014, sparked outrage in Spain but on Tuesday, a court in Melilla decided to drop the case for lack of evidence.
Rights group Prodein that filmed the violence and submitted the evidence to court, vowed to fight back.
""We are going to appeal,"" spokesman Jose Palazon told AFP.
The footage shows eight Civil Guard police officers trying to force a group of migrants off the top of a six-metre (20-foot) high fence separating Melilla from Morocco.
As a migrant nears a ladder provided by police and attempts to descend, he is repeatedly hit by policemen with batons and falls to the ground.
The footage then shows him carried to the Moroccan side of the fence without receiving any medical attention.
A judge in Melilla on Tuesday dropped the case against the eight police officers citing lack of evidence, saying the victim had not been identified.
Although the images showed officers using a ""disproportionate"" level of force, the judge found that ""the evidence was limited to the video footage and statements from police and some witnesses"".
But Palazon rejected his argument, saying that not enough effort had been made to locate the victim. ""All sorts of efforts could have been done to identify the victim in Morocco,"" he told AFP.
Melilla and Ceuta, another Spanish enclave on Morocco's northern coast, form the only land border between Europe and Africa.
Each year, thousands of migrants risk their lives trying to enter the two territories to try to find a better life in Europe."

Spain's maritime service said rescuers had picked up 12 migrants who were travelling on two boats while Morocco had intercepted 11 people who were on another two vessels. The migrants were given blankets and transported to the port of Tarifa in the Spanish province of Cadiz which is located across the Strait of Gibraltar facing Morocco. Spanish police then took them to a detention centre for undocumented migrants. The use of inflatable rubber boats, instead of larger and more secure wooden fishing vessels, by African migrants trying to enter Spain from Morocco is on the rise. Spanish authorities on Monday intercepted 27 illegal immigrants travelling in three inflatable boats. Another 35 migrants were picked up on March 18 on four inflatable boats. ""The 'modus operandi' used by migrants trying to reach Spain has changed in recent months,"" said Antonio Fernandez, the head of emergency operations for the Spanish Red Cross. ""Instead of using a boat where 30 or 40 people attempt the crossing, they are literally buying toy boats made of plastic with room for four, five or six people and they try to cross,"" he said. ""This method is more precarious, if that is possible. There is a greater risk of sinking and therefore of drowning."" The Strait of Gibraltar separates Spain and Morocco by only 15 kilometres (nine miles) -- a ferry ride between the two continents takes roughly 35 minutes — making it one of the key smuggling routes for illegal immigrants crossing into Europe. Thousands of illegal migrants from Africa regularly attempt to cross from Morocco into Spain on makeshift boats each year. Some travel thousands of miles overland, being handed from smuggler to smuggler, ending up at one of many ports in northern Africa for a cramped and treacherous sea crossing to European soil. The number of migrants who arrived on Spanish shores by boat last year totalled 3,804, a 30 percent drop from 2012, according to interior ministry figures. Other migrants try to cross illegally into the tiny Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, perched on the coast of north Africa and both claimed by Morocco. Spain reinforced the metal border fence separating Melilla from Morocco in August after a resurgence of crossing attempts, with hundreds of would-be immigrants waiting nearby for a chance to climb over. Earlier this month about 150 African migrants stormed a border fence in Melilla and crossed illegally from Morocco into Spanish territory and about 50 of them managed to enter the enclave. Twelve people were injured, including two Spanish policemen who were attacked as they tried to stop the migrants, according to the local Spanish government delegation. The Moroccan Association of Human Rights said 25 people were injured, including a 30-year-old from Cameron who died from his injuries on March 18 at a hospital in the Moroccan city of Nador. Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders announced on March 13 that it was closing its projects in Morocco in protest at the plight of African migrants allegedly abused by Spanish and Moroccan police as they try to reach European soil. Melilla received 2,224 illegal immigrants last year, 262 more than in 2011, according to Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz. Instability in Africa's Sahel region, especially in Mali, is behind the rise in illegal immigrants trying to enter the enclave, he added."

There are now fears for his well-being, a human rights group told The Local.
Prodein, a pro-human rights group based in the Spanish North African enclave of Melilla, has posted a video online which shows Civil Guard officers beating a would-be immigrant who was attempting to scale the complex of security fences designed to prevent migrants from reaching Spanish soil. Then the man is shown being carried, apparently unconscious, to the Moroccan side of the border. The video, apparently filmed during Wednesday’s mass attempt to cross the triple barrier by around 140 sub-Saharan migrants, shows how a man the NGO Prodein has named as Danny, a Cameroonian believed to be 23 years old, was beaten by security forces with truncheons after they had persuaded him to use a ladder to climb down off the fence. José Palazón, the president of Prodein, told The Local on Friday that he is extremely concerned about the whereabouts and well-being of Danny after various stories began to circulate that he had died from his wounds or was being treated in a Moroccan hospital. ""Tomorrow a group from our association is going to cross the border to look for him,"" Palazón said, adding: ""All we have heard so far are rumours."" The images show several migrants hanging onto the Spanish side of the fence while Civil Guard officers wait for them below or try to remove them. Así defiende ""ESPAÑA"" el Ministerio del Interior (2) from Asociación Pro.De.In. Melilla on Vimeo. The individual known as Danny was beaten several times as he descended and as he lay on the ground before being carried away by border guards to a nearby gate in the fence complex. Prodein says that the images clearly show an illegal return of an immigrant to Morocco when, according to Spanish and international law, once a person has reached Spanish soil, they must be formally identified and given the opportunity to request asylum. The Spanish government’s delegation in Melilla denied that the Cameroonian had been knocked unconscious, saying that the migrant had adopted an attitude of “passive resistance”. Prodein and other human rights organisations have reported many incidents of what they consider illegal expulsions of immigrants, incidents which the Spanish government refers to as “rejections at the border”. A judge is investigating an instance from earlier this year in which Civil Guard officers are apparently shown returning migrants to the Moroccan side of the fence in a video. During Wednesday’s assault on the Melilla fence, one Civil Guard agent was badly injured after falling from near the top of a fence during a struggle with a migrant. The authorities also reported that some of the would-be immigrants had directed saliva and urine at the border guards shouting “Ebola” as they did so. Other guards are said to have suffered wounds and three immigrants who reached Spanish soil are to be reported to Melilla’s court for “resisting authority”. The Civil Guard has also distributed a video in which metal hooks and cleft sticks are shown, tools which the migrants use to climb the fence after the decision to add ‘anti-climb’ mesh to the fences around Melilla and Spain’s other North African city of Ceuta earlier this year. On May 28th about 500 migrants climbed over the triple-layer border fence into Melilla — one of the biggest breaches in nearly a decade, while in February 15 Africans drowned off the coast of Ceuta after the Civil Guard had fired rubber bullets toward a group trying to swim to Spain."

The 'verbal' ban was originally reported by Spanish daily El Mundo before official word was given by the ministry headed up by Jorge Fernández Díaz.
It follows a storm of controversy after 15 migrants died earlier this month in an incident currently being investigated by a Ceuta court.
Civil Guard officers are alleged to have fired rubber bullets at swimmers who were struggling to reach Spanish territory.
But according to media reports, officers have now been instructed that they should use rubber bullets only in self-defence. They have been told that even shots into the air or the water are not allowed.
The use of blank cartridges 'which only make a noise' has not been banned.
Rumours of a possible ban started on Monday when 100 migrants successfully scaled the fences in Melilla and were not fired upon by the Civil Guard.

In the latest incident, which took place on Monday evening, nine Algerians escaped from a holding centre in Murcia, a region in the south east, police said.
Spain has seven migrant detention centres for holding people living in the country illegally as officials decide whether or not to deport them.
But there have been a growing number of riots and break-outs as migrants protest their detention in what critics say are prison-like conditions.
A regional spokeswoman said migrants had set light to paper and clothing ""to attract attention"" and had then attacked police who came to the scene, sparking a confrontation in which nine officers were slightly injured.
Last month, there were two other breakouts from the same centre, with more than 70 migrants fleeing. There have also been similar protests at centres in Madrid and Barcelona in recent weeks.
In one incident in Madrid on October 18th, dozens of migrants climbed onto the roof of the facility - a former prison - spending the night there and unfurling a banner reading ""freedom"".
Both Madrid and Barcelona have been governed since June 2015 by citizens' platforms backed by far-left party Podemos, which wants these centres closed.
Critics say that steep public spending cuts imposed by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government have worsened conditions at the centres.
Dilapidated, understaffed
Police union SUP says many facilities are dilapidated and have insufficient staff. It says centres in the south, for instance, flood when it rains to the point that detainees have to roll up their trousers to the knee.
Javier Monje, SUP's spokesman in Murcia, called on Tuesday for the centre to be closed.
""It cannot stay open a minute more,"" he told AFP, pointing out that police at the centre were under equipped.
In an interview published last month in online daily eldiario.es, Ramiro Garcia de Dios, the judge in charge of overseeing Madrid's migrant centre, alleged police impunity was also rife.

After the first boat docked, medical staff wearing white overalls, gloves and masks went on board to carry out initial medical checks before the migrants disembarked in groups of 20.
The migrants, most of them from Africa, were welcomed by a team of more than 2,000 people, including 470 translators and 1,000 Red Cross volunteers who distributed basic items such as blankets, clothes and hygiene kits

High waves and winds had forced the naval convoy to take a detour on its 1,500-kilometre (930-mile) voyage to Spain, ending a week-long odyssey in the Mediterranean.
'Welcome home'
At the port, a huge banner was hung up saying ""Welcome home"" in various languages including Arabic.
""Today is a historic day,"" said Father Angel Garcia Rodriguez, a well-known priest who heads the Messengers of Peace NGO which is helping migrants at the port. ""It will be hard for Spaniards not to smile when they see these children disembark.""
Among the passengers are 450 men and 80 women -- at least seven of them pregnant -- as well as 89 adolescents and 11 children under the age of 13, figures released by the Valencian authorities show.
They come from 26 countries, mainly from Africa but also Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, MSF said. Those with injuries -- mainly scratches and burns -- were taken to hospital along with the pregnant woman, local health officials said.
A French offer
The Aquarius rescued the migrants off Libya's coast last weekend but Italy's new populist government and Malta both refused to let it dock, accusing each other of failing to meet their humanitarian and EU commitments.
Spain eventually stepped in and agreed to receive the refugees as a ""political gesture"" to ""oblige Europe to forge a common policy to a common problem,"" Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said.
Madrid on Saturday said it had accepted an offer from France -- who had angered Rome by branding it irresponsible -- to welcome Aquarius migrants who ""meet the criteria for asylum"".
Two countries will ""work together"" to handle the arrival, Spain's deputy prime minister Carmen Calvo said.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for his gesture, saying it was ""exactly the kind of cooperation Europe needs"" at this hour.
'Voyages of death'
The plight of the Aquarius has again highlighted the failure of EU member states to work together to deal with the influx of migrant arrivals since 2015. After Rome's decision to ban the Aquarius, Macron and Italian premier
Giuseppe Conte met on Friday and agreed that the EU should set up asylum processing centres in Africa to prevent ""voyages of death"".
They also demanded ""profound"" changes to the EU's asylum rules which put the migrant burden on their port of entry to Europe -- mainly Italy and Greece.
Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini warned Saturday that other NGO operated rescue ships would also be banned from docking.
""While the Aquarius is sailing towards Spain, two other Dutch NGO operated vessels (Lifeline and Seefuchs) have arrived off the Libyan coast, to wait for their human cargos once the people smugglers abandon them,"" Salvini wrote on Facebook.
""These people should know that Italy no longer wants to be any part of this business of clandestine immigration and they will have to look for other ports to go to,"" he said."

The use of the new jail as a so-called CIE, a centre where migrants are held pending asylum claims or deportation after they arrive in Spain, drew sharp criticism by rights groups.
Spanish law states that CIEs must not ""be penitentiary in nature.""
But the interior ministry said it had decided to use the jail due to a lack of space at other detention centres, as the number of migrant arrivals in Spain more than doubled last year on 2016, setting a new record at around
22,900.
""The interior ministry has always preferred this solution to building temporary camps, as has been done in other countries, which don't guarantee the minimum worthy living conditions,"" it said.
Romero said she thought the evacuation had been enacted in direct response to the controversy caused by the death of Bouderbala, who according to an autopsy hanged himself with a sheet.

""We are deeply concerned to see the close cooperation between Spain and Morocco on border control today resulting in... widespread violence against migrants and security practices outside of any legal framework,"" the eight NGOs said in the open letter seen by AFP on Friday. ""We ask you to intervene urgently with your government to put an end to these practices,"" said the group, with included the Moroccan branch of Caritas and migrant support group GADEM. Their call comes one week after at least 12 sub-Saharan Africans drowned as hundreds tried to reach the Spanish territory of Ceuta by swimming from a beach in neighbouring Morocco. The incident has fuelled international concerns about the violent treatment of illegal immigrants by Spanish and Moroccan security forces amid reports that Spain's civil guards fired rubber-coated bullets at those attempting the crossing on February 6. The European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmström, said on Friday that she was ""very concerned"" about Spanish border police using rubber bullets to deter migrants, and expected ""clarifications,"" in a comment posted on Twitter. Spanish authorities say the civil guards did use rubber bullets to ward off the migrants but that they fired them in the air and did not target anyone directly, claims contradicted by witness accounts. ""Last Friday, we received several dozen people who were part of the group that tried to enter Ceuta on the morning of February 6,"" the letter by the Moroccan NGOs said. ""Those who went by sea witnessed Spanish security forces firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the boats and the people themselves, even as they were calling for help."" The letter to the ambassador argued that the Spanish government had ""responsibility"" for the growing number of human rights violations against migrants either side of its North African borders.
Morocco, under pressure from Spain, has cracked down on the rising influx of sub-Saharan migrants entering the country illegally and heading to its northern shores in a desperate quest to cross the Mediterranean. Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's other enclave bordering Morocco, have the EU's only land borders with Africa and are seen as stepping stones to mainland Europe. In the face of allegations that several had died at the hands of police in 2013, Rabat launched an operation last month to ""regularise"" the papers of the estimated 25,000 illegal immigrants on its soil, allowing them to remain and work in Morocco. Rabat says it has already received 10,000 requests. Government spokesman Mustapha Khlafi hit back at criticism earlier this week from Human Rights Watch, which said security forces ""commonly beat, otherwise abuse and sometimes steal"" from migrants. He said Moroccan authorities were ready to investigate allegations of violence against illegal immigrants."

The Ceuta court pn Thursday said it had ""ordered a temporary stay of proceedings"" against the officers for the suspected crimes of homicide and injuries caused by negligence due to a lack of evidence.
But the court said it could reopen the investigation if it receives the results of the autopsies carried out on the bodies of the 15 migrants.
The court said Spain had repeatedly asked Morocco for the results of the autopsies but has received no reply.
In February the court named the 16 police officers as suspects in the investigation and ordered them to appear in court for questioning. The officers were never charged.
Over 200 migrants tried early on February 6th, 2014 to swim to Ceuta, one of two Spanish territories surrounded by Morocco and the Mediterranean Sea.
Only about 20 migrants managed to enter Ceuta and they were immediately returned to Morocco.
Over the following days 15 bodies were found in the area, five in beaches in Ceuta and the rest in beaches in Morocco.
Despite initial denials, Spain's interior ministry last year released videos showing police firing rubber bullets as the migrants swam toward Ceuta's shore but denied the action contributed to the drowning.
Rights groups said the rubber bullets pierced the life preservers used by the migrants, many of whom did not know how to swim, and demanded an investigation.
The Ceuta court wrote in its ruling that there was ""no indication"" that the agents ""inadequately used riot control materials"".
""The migrants assumed the risk of entering Spanish territory by swimming, in a group, under the cover of darkness, wearing a great deal of clothes and ignoring the warnings from both Spanish and Moroccan police,"" the court added."

While waiting to fulfil his dream, Ismail ambles around the port of Ceuta -- a Spanish enclave in Morocco - wandering the streets like dozens of other children.
""At home, there's no future,"" said the teenager, slouched on the pavement dressed in a sweatshirt and beanie hat.
Originally from Tangier in northern Morocco, Ismail said he grew up in a poor family and left school aged 12.
With the permission of his mother, who prays for him to reach Europe, he travelled the 100 kilometres (60 miles) to Ceuta and two months ago climbed the border fence at dawn.
Recounting his story surrounded by around a dozen youths, he described himself as ""addicted to hashish"" as his companions bickered over sharing a joint.

A frail looking boy, the youngest of the group, acted as lookout in the ongoing game of hide and seek with Spain's Civil Guard police force.
In order to reach Ceuta or Melilla, another Spanish enclave, migrants must first scale the barbed wire fences which mark the only land borders between Europe and Africa.
Those under 18 are hoping to benefit from European legislation which gives them greater protection than adult migrants -- and limits the chances of their being deported.
The regulations are enforced to varying degrees within the European Union and, after years of migrants travelling across the sea, the rules are becoming increasingly restrictive.
Dreams or destitution
But Ismail will not be deterred and sees his future in the Spanish capital, following in the footsteps of one of his neighbours.
""He lives in Madrid, a really beautiful city,"" Ismail said passionately, describing his own wish to ""become a mechanic, buy a car and a house"".
Like the dozens of young migrants in Ceuta, realising his dreams entails clinging onto the underside of a vehicle boarding a ship for the port of Algeciras in southern Spain.
After making the 40-minute sea crossing, they continue their journey on land towards their final destination -- be it Madrid, Paris, or elsewhere.
But whether originating from Sub-Saharan Africa, Morocco or Algeria, child and adult migrants frequently find themselves destitute.
The charity Save the Children recently raised concerns about ""the vulnerability of these boy migrants, who find themselves alone on the streets of Ceuta, exposed to all types of danger"".
In 2016 the organisation found a total of 246 unaccompanied minors in Ceuta, and nearly 1,000 in Melilla.
The group of young hopefuls in Ceuta survive by sleeping in cars and scrounging cigarettes and food.
Research association Migreurop last month denounced ""police violence"" against the young migrants on both sides of the border, calling on Spain and Morocco to ""respect the rights of child migrants"".
'Make a life'
Their perilous attempts to cling onto trucks going through the port are high-risk, with Ismail saying one of his friends was ""killed intentionally"" last month when he was run over.
""Look, they want to finish with us,"" he said angrily, as truck drivers went full-speed at the sight of the approaching boys.
Despite hostility from drivers and the authorities, one young woman arrived to offer the group some rare support.
""She works for an association where you can go to shower, get online or watch films,"" said Nabil, the eldest of the group.
Originally from the Moroccan capital Rabat, where he grew up in a working class neighbourhood, the 20-year-old passes himself off as a minor.
Despite tales of success reaching the youths from Europe, the reality for young migrants is often far from the dreams held at the portside.
Those who have gone before them are frequently left exploited and isolated, with dozens of young Moroccans resorting to petty theft to survive on the streets of Paris.
They remain wary of authorities and often refuse help, prompting the resentment of locals.
But the young migrants in Ceuta are determined to continue along their uncertain path, with Nabil aiming to reach Germany.
To ""make a life for myself and see what Morocco looks like from the outside,"" he said.

					15:28 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,UN warns Spain over migrant deportations,"The United Nations on Tuesday warned Spain over planned changes to legislation allowing the country to instantly deport migrants who clamber border fences into its north African territories, saying Madrid could fall foul of international law.
""UNHCR is concerned over a proposal by Spain to legalize automatic returns of people trying to cross border fences into its enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla,"" said the UN refugee agency's spokesman William Spindler. Spindler told reporters that UNHCR understood the ""complexity"" of border management in the two enclaves, which are tucked into Morocco's Mediterranean coast. But blanket, on the spot deportations could fall foul of the 1951 Refugee Convention, an international treaty protecting people who flee their homelands, he said. ""UNHCR stresses the importance of permitting access to territory to seek international protection,"" he said. The two Spanish cities — which are the only land borders between the European Union and Africa — have since 2013 seen a sharp increase in numbers of illegal immigrants aiming to head into Europe itself. The Spanish government last week announced that it would include a legal amendment in its planned new Citizen Security Law authorizing police to expel migrants who climb the fence around Melilla and Ceuta, without giving their asylum claims a hearing — a move slammed by opposition parties. ""When people reach Spanish territory, their right to ask for asylum had to be respected in the same way whether they come via Melilla or (Madrid's) Barajas airport,"" said Trinidad Jiménez, the foreign affairs spokesperson for Spain's largest opposition party, the socialist PSOE. Meanwhile, the United Left (IU) party said the government ""instead of getting rid of inhumane practices"", was ""announcing a reform that would legalize most of them"". Spindler said that around two thirds of those trying to cross the seven-metre (23-foot), triple-layer border fence were from countries torn by war, violence and persecution, including Syria, Central Africa Republic and Mali. In 2013, around 4,200 people entered the enclaves illegally by land and sea, he said. ""So far this year, over 5,000 people have arrived, including 2,000 people fleeing the conflict in Syria, of whom 70 percent are women and children,"" he added. Spindler also raised concerns about what he said was the growing use of violence at the border to deter migrants and asylum-seekers from trying to enter. Earlier this month, a local human rights group, Prodein, filmed a video of Spanish officers beating a migrant as he hung on the fence and then carrying him apparently unconscious back to the Moroccan side. ""UNHCR calls upon the Spanish authorities to ensure that no violence is exercised at the Spanish borders and that they are managed with full respect for human rights and refugee law,"" said Spindler, echoing an earlier European Commission call. The government denies that migrants who climb the fence should be considered as having reached Spanish territory. Over recent months, crowds of migrants have sat perched for hours on the fence waiting for a chance to climb down and evade capture on the Spanish side. In the latest attempts, hundreds tried unsuccessfully to storm the Melilla fence last week. Just one made it over into the area between the layers of fencing and was taken to hospital with a head wound, government officials said."

They're not the only ones to have stepped onto Spanish shores with dreams of making it big in the sporting world. Associations and migrants say roughly a quarter of new arrivals' main reason for coming is to play professionally.
But a large majority are soon brought back down to earth with a bang when faced with the long search for residency papers while eking out a living.
Sense of belonging
Karim Issa Abdou and Yves Kepse Tchonang are arguably among the lucky ones. While their lives are totally separate, they share many similarities.
Both 27-years-old, they clambered over the barbed wire and razor-sharp blades of the triple barrier between Morocco and Spain's overseas territory of Melilla, one of only two land borders between Africa and the European Union.

Karim now plays for Alma de Africa (""Heart and Soul of Africa"" in English), a football team in southern Jerez de la Frontera composed almost exclusively of migrants in the second division of the regional league.
Yves plays at front row at Rugby Club Valencia more than 700 kilometres (450 miles) away in eastern Spain, in the first division of the regional league.

While they're not professional, which means they aren't paid for playing, both are surrounded by associations that can provide legal and housing support.
Crucially, being part of a team has given meaning to otherwise difficult lives, they say.
""Alma de Africa has given me stability,"" says Karim, sipping a beer at a bar in Jerez, large headphones round his neck ready to play music like Cameroon's makossa or rap by France's Booba.
A self-confessed brawler when the team was formed in 2015, he says he has since settled down.
Robbed, injured
Born in a nomadic family in Ngaoundere in northern Cameroon, Karim says he left when he was only around 10 years old with a friend.
It took him some four years to go through Nigeria, Niger and Algeria before arriving in Morocco, where he lived another three years in the Gourougou Mountain that overlooks Melilla.

Along the way, the Zinedine Zidane fan earned money to keep going, doing odd jobs, just like Yves, who cuts an imposing, brawny figure.
One of seven siblings, Yves left home in the western city of Bafoussam in 2012 ""to play rugby.""
In Niger, he recalls many instances of employers refusing to pay him and threatening to call the police.
Both recount being robbed of their possessions along the way, as do other Alma de Africa members.
""When you're a kid, there are people who take your phone, everything you have, the rucksack, the clothes, the money, and you have to start afresh,"" says Karim, a contagious laugh always at the ready despite difficult recollections.

His teammate Malick Doumbouya, an 18-year-old from Guinea, says he was held by jihadist rebels in northern Mali. ""They locked us up until we gave them money.""
Karim finally managed to get into Melilla in 2008.
He says he was wearing five trousers and had wrapped his hands with old clothes to protect himself from the blades, but his leg still caught one, leaving him with a bleeding gash that saw him admitted to hospital on the other side.
Others did not make it that far, recalls Christian Tchikagoua, another teammate.
He left Cameroon with his best friend, who later drowned in the water trying to get to Ceuta, another overseas Spanish territory, he says.
His friend joins hundreds of migrants who have died trying to get to Spain, the third busiest gateway for migrants coming to Europe, with more than 28,000 arrivals in 2017, according to the International Organization for Migration.

In Spain, hardship continues
Once in Spanish territory, the hunt for a residency permit begins, with the constant fear of being deported.
""They're ghosts, they have a very rough time, with a lot of fear,"" says Alejandro Benitez, president of Alma de Africa who co-founded the team.
Yves, though, is lucky. He got his residency permit last August, thanks to his team which gave him a job as receptionist and electrician, earning €850 ($1,050) a month.
Karim is still waiting, and survives on odd jobs like gardening or washing cars.
A tough daily existence he says has been bettered by his football team, and his recent marriage to his Spanish girlfriend of two years.
""If I had known the life I would lead until now, I wouldn't have come,"" admits Karim -- an acknowledgement echoed by Yves.
First sport migrant centre?

Both Yves and Karim would like to be paid as professionals.
""The dream is to live off this, even if it's earning just €1,000 a month,"" says Karim.
But it's tough. Alma de Africa, for instance, is struggling financially, living as it does off donations, memberships and sponsorships.
""With this we struggle by, as we need a lot of money in this category,"" says Benitez, whose team has risen in the league every year since 2015.
He encourages his players to train in other areas and hunt for jobs.

The same goes for the president of Yves' rugby club, Fran Baixauli, who says he has always told him: ""Get training where you need to, if it's as an electrician, then be an electrician.""
Still, vaunting the merits of sport as an integrator, Benitez has the ambition to create the first sports-focused migrant shelter which would give them professional training in the sector.
""It's a very ambitious and very costly project, but it would be amazing,"" he says.

Morocco has struggled to cope with a rising tide of sub-Saharan Africans heading to its northern shores in their desperate quest to cross the Mediterranean, and its security forces have increasingly come under fire for beating, arbitrarily detaining and deporting illegal immigrants. Rabat launched an operation in January to regularise the situation of migrants and grant them residency permits, in the face of allegations that several of them had died at the hands of the police last year. But HRW said, in a 79-page report launched in Rabat, that despite some improvement since the new migration policy was announced in September, the security forces ""commonly beat, otherwise abuse and sometimes steal"" from sub-Saharan migrants. ""Morocco should make clear to its security forces that migrants have rights,"" said HRW refugee program director Bill Frelick, urging Rabat to introduce ""firm procedures"" to ensure those rights are respected. HRW also criticised the Spanish security forces for using ""excessive force when they summarily expel migrants"" from their north African territories of Ceuta and Melilla, Europe's only land borders with Africa. ""(Spain's expulsion of illegal immigrants violates) international and European Union (EU) law, which prohibit countries from forcibly returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment,"" the report said. ""Spanish authorities should also ensure diligent investigations of allegations of excessive use of force by its own forces... against migrants.""
On Thursday, nine sub-Saharans, including one women, drowned while trying to swim to Ceuta, after hundreds of migrants headed out to sea from the Moroccan town of Fnideq. Spanish media and rights groups cited migrants alleging that police fired into the sea where the Africans were swimming as Moroccan and Spanish security forces tried to repel them from Ceuta. But the Spanish authorities denied the allegation, saying that civil guards in Ceuta did use rubber bullets to ward off the migrants but fired into the air and did not target anyone directly. ""We did not use anti-riot equipment when the immigrants were in the water,"" said the head of the Spanish government's delegation in Ceuta, Francisco Antonio Gonzalez."

Spain has demanded more EU money to strengthen its borders as thousands of Africans try to enter Ceuta and Melilla, two fenced-off Spanish cities on Morocco's northern tip which have the European Union's only land borders with Africa. Last year 4,235 undocumented migrants crossed into the two territories, up 49 percent from 2,841 in 2012, although the figure was 15 percent down on 2001 figures, the interior ministry said in a statement. The flow of desperate Africans heading to Ceuta and Melilla has surged over the past year, with migrants regularly storming the six-metre-high (20-foot) border fences. Others try to smuggle themselves past checkpoints hidden in the undercarriages of cars or sail across the strait of Gibraltar to mainland Spain in flimsy inflatable dinghies. The government said on Tuesday however that the number of undocumented migrants reaching Spanish shores by boat eased by 15 percent overall to 3,237 in 2013.
The number was also down 90.7 percent on 2006 figures when 39,180 reached Spain by boat, the ministry added for context. On February 6th around 15 migrants drowned in Moroccan waters while trying to swim to Ceuta from a nearby beach. In two separate incidents in March, between 800 and 1,000 migrants climbed over the triple border fence at Melilla, authorities said. Spain's government agreed last week to spend €2.1 million ($2.9 million) to boost security at the Ceuta and Melilla borders. Migrants who reach the cities are taken to overcrowded processing centres while authorities decide whether to grant them asylum or send them back to their countries of origin.

Civil Guard agents used a heartbeat detector to locate the minors, who ran the risk of considerable danger owing to “the weight of the scrap metal, its instability, sharp edges and the time the boat would have been docked in the port”, Civil Guard sources confirmed to El País.
Despite the danger from the heavy, sharp metal, none of the minors needed medical attention. They were all transferred to Melilla´s social services.

					13:09 CEST+02:00				", The Local,What Don Quixote has to say to Spain about today's migrant crisis,"Patricia E Grieve, of Colombia University explains what Spaniards can learn from their literary classic about today's migrant crisis.
In 1492, the Spanish Inquisition forced Jews to convert to Christianity or to leave the Iberian peninsula - on pain of death. Some five centuries later, in June 2015, the Spanish Parliament invited the descendants of those Jewish exiles to apply for Spanish citizenship without having to give up their current passports.
As the Catholic Church continued to establish its primacy at the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century, Spain's Muslims, too, were forced to convert.
Called moriscos, these Muslims made up, by some estimates, approximately 4% of the country's population. But they were not to be there for long.
By 1609, the royal expulsion had been decreed - the moriscos were ordered to leave Spain. And they did, in waves, between 1609 and 1614. To this day, their descendants have been denied the ""right of return.""
So why are the descendants of Sephardic Jews allowed to return and the descendants of Muslim converts not?
Might the great Spanish writer Cervantes, whose second volume of Don Quixote was published 400 years ago this year - right after the expulsion of the moriscos - shine any light on this current debate?
Richly textured writing
When I teach Don Quixote to my students at Columbia, we can find a dark, deeply satirical, and skeptical Cervantes, but also a more nuanced and multicultural one, capable of tremendous irony. This is not - as is assumed by some - by-the-book Spanish Catholic and traditional orthodoxy.
What we see is a Cervantes of complex humanity. Despite being captured by pirates and imprisoned in Algiers, and, from the little we know, having lived a life of many deep disappointments, we see in his writings that he was still able to sort out good and bad - among Spaniards, Turks, North Africans, English, Catholics, Protestants and moriscos - by their behavior and not by their labels.
Cervantes is most often remembered for Don Quixote, giving the world the term ""quixotic"" and the phrase ""tilting at windmills,"" and the endearing and often frustrating characters of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.
A portrait of Miguel de Cervantes by Juan de Jauregui y Aguilar / Wikimedia Commons
Less generally known, but significant even today, is the voice Cervantes gave to ideas of freedom and tolerance, especially religious freedom and the powerful love of one's homeland.
This occurs most notably in Part II of Don Quixote through the character Ricote the Morisco, a former neighbor of Sancho Panza, who has settled in Germany after the historical expulsion of the moriscos.
Ricote longs for his homeland, Spain.
Ricote, his countrymen and Cervantes
Ricote, though he might face death if discovered, has sneaked back into the country, dressed as a pilgrim, in order to find buried money he had been forced to leave behind.
While revealing to Sancho that he himself has been less devoted to Christianity, nevertheless he has a wife and daughter who were true converts. Surprisingly, he defends King Philip III's decree, while vividly painting the effect on himself, his family, and other moriscos:
You know very well, O Sancho Panza, my neighbour and friend, how the proclamation and edict that His Majesty issues against those of my race brought terror and fear to all of us…It seems to me it was divine inspiration that moved His Majesty to put into effect so noble a resolution, not because all of us were guilty, for some were firm and true Christians, though these were so few they could not oppose those who were not, but because it is not a good idea to nurture a snake in your bosom or shelter enemies in your house. In short, it was just and reasonable for us to be chastised with the punishment of exile: lenient and mild, according to some, but for us it was the most terrible we could have received. No matter where we are we weep for Spain, for, after all, we were born here and it is our native country.
Spain, like other European countries, feared the power of the Ottoman Turks, whose expansionist movements seemed unstoppable in the 16th century.
But Spain had a unique situation that contributed to the fear of the Ottoman Turks.
As a land that had been under Muslim domination for hundreds of years (from AD 711 to the mid-13th century) when Christian conquests of important cities left only the Kingdom of Granada until it, too, fell in 1492, Spain had a significant Muslim population, especially along the coasts.
Across the Mediterranean, the Barbary states of North Africa were under Muslim control.
Although forced conversions of Muslims in the 16th century intended to create a society of Christians, both Church and Crown feared that Muslims were “false converts,” remaining ""crypto-Muslims,"" disloyal to Spain, and worse, conspiring with Constantinople to bring about the fall of Catholic Spain.

To be sure, Christian forces across Europe enjoyed significant victories, defeating the Ottoman Turks, for example, at the Battle of Vienna in 1529.
Nevertheless, Spain felt acutely the dangers of morisco society. Church and Crown turned away from what they saw as failed strategies of assimilation and instead debated, confirmed and then justified the strategies of expulsion that took place in waves between 1609 and 1614.
While some may see Ricote's defense of King Philip III's decree as Cervantes toeing an orthodox line, it is obvious that a multicultural Cervantes also managed to air opposing views, under the eagle eye of the Inquisitional censors.
While nodding to the perceived political efficacy of expulsion (the moriscos may not be ""true Christians""), Cervantes nevertheless makes no small point when he writes that the morisco exile ""weeps for Spain"" and the loss of his own country. Cervantes is unique in the degree of sympathy he shows to the moriscos and in his recognition of their allegiance to Spain.
And so, the descendants of moriscos ask today, how can Spain offer differential treatment to descendants of Sephardic Jews and moriscos? Do the Sephardic Jews feel any more keenly the loss of homeland than do the descendants of moriscos?
Justifying differential treatment
The Spanish government has congratulated itself on righting a historic wrong by allowing dual citizenship to the descendants of Sephardic Jews.
But, at the same time, it maintains that the two cases have no basis for comparison. In one case, they argue, bigotry lay at the heart of the expulsion. In the other, the expulsion of the moriscos was the result of decades of political clashes and thereby warrants no apology. As a member of Portugal's Parliament (that has passed a similar law inviting Sephardic Jews to ""return"") put it:
Persecution of Jews was just that, while what happened with the Arabs was part of a conflict.
But, a more obvious answer may lie in the migrant crisis facing Europe today.

Spain has particular problems with a growing number of refugees crossing the narrow Strait of Gibraltar from North Africa, and has already faced severe criticism by other members of the European Union for allowing its borders to be so porous, thereby opening the way for migrants to enter France and other countries. Although human rights activists have called for a more holistic response to immigration on the part of the European Union, it has still been left to the Southern European countries on the front line to bear the brunt of the migration crisis.
Because of the large number of descendants of moriscos around the world - some estimate tens of millions, most of whom are in North Africa - observers say that virtually overnight, if Spain were to rescind the Edict of Expulsion of the moriscos, it could become the largest Muslim population in the European Union.
According to a study conducted last year by the University of Limerick, Spanish attitudes toward immigrants have significantly worsened since 2002. A 2014 Pew survey revealed that more Spaniards are negative about Muslims (46% unfavorable) than are Germans (33%) or British (26%).
Interestingly, although Spanish scholar Americo Castro (1885-1972) recognized that Cervantes' works demonstrated religious and ethnic tolerance, most criticism of Cervantes in Spain today is far less engaged with views of his tolerance than are scholars who are based in the US and Britain.
There are many things Spain itself must consider in dealing with the migration crisis, and no one underestimates the vast number of problems.
But maintaining a flimsy line of defense between the justification for allowing the descendants of Sephardic Jews to return to their homeland because of their much smaller number, while continuing to force the descendants of moriscos to ""weep for Spain,"" like Ricote the Morisco, should not continue.

""Morocco rejects and has always rejected these kinds of methods for managing the issue of migration flows,"" Nasser Bourita said in Rabat after meeting his Spanish counterpart Josep Borrell.
Bourita criticised such measures as ""easy solutions"" and ""counterproductive"".
Along with Tunisia and Albania, Morocco has been one of the countries mentioned as possible locations to host migrants at reception centres outside Europe, an issue to be discussed at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday.
Spain is the third biggest destination for migrants in the European Union after Italy and Greece.
Migrants are increasingly favouring the so-called western Mediterranean route to reach Europe, which involves making the sea crossing between North Africa and southern mainland Spain.
While the number of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean has halved this year compared to 2017, the total reaching Spain has tripled, according to the International Organization for Migration.
Some 12,155 people have arrived in Spain so far this year, the IOM's most recent figures show, and a further 292 died in the attempt.
All in all, close to 1,000 migrants have lost their lives in the Mediterranean this year, they add.

At least seven migrants drowned on Thursday as they tried to swim to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta from a beach in neighbouring Morocco, Moroccan authorities said. The tragedy took place after Moroccan security forces and Spain’s Civil Guard Police repelled the entry of up to 400 sub-Saharan immigrants, Spanish daily 20minutos reported. The news comes just days after a video filmed by a Melilla-based NGO worker showcased how Spanish authorities were illegally handing back to Morocco dozens of sub-Saharan immigrants who had jumped the security fence into the Spanish North African enclave. “Morocco doesn’t accept injured immigrants,” reads the video narration in reference to the controversial barbed wire put up several months ago in a bid to dissuade immigrants from crossing the border. The law stipulates that immigrants who enter Spanish territory should be taken immediately to the closest police station where they are identified and have the right to a legal and medical assistance as well as an interpreter. Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz admitted on Tuesday that there were “isolated cases” in which Spain’s Civil Guard breached legislation. The footage also contradicts comments made by Spain’s delegate in Melilla, Abdelmalik el Barkani, who denied irregular expulsions ever took place. Ceuta and Spain's other north African enclave Melilla have the European Union's only land borders with Africa. They are seen as stepping stones to a better life in Europe for sub-Saharan migrants, who often risk their lives attempting to enter the tiny Spanish enclaves, either by sea or by storming the six metre (20 foot) barriers that separate them from Morocco. On Sunday, the bodies of five presumed migrants thought to have been trying to reach Spain in an inflatable boat, were found in the Nador area of Morocco's northern coast, near Melilla. According to the Rif Human Rights Association, more than 40 migrants have died trying to reach Ceuta and Melilla from Morocco in the past two years. Many more attempt the perilous journey across the Strait of Gibraltar, often in overloaded makeshift boats. Morocco estimates that there are around 30,000 illegal immigrants on its soil, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa. Earlier this year, authorities launched an operation to regularize the situation by giving some of them residency permits."

Proactiva Open Arms, whose two ships sail back and forth in the Mediterranean to save migrants in distress, said it had decided to return a day after saving the 40-year-old woman from Cameroon.
In a statement explaining why it had decided to go back to Spain, the NGO said authorities in Italy had offered to take in the woman but not the two bodies.
It added it feared ""for the protection of the surviving woman and her complete freedom to testify"" on what had happened at sea if they left her in Italy, which has taken a hardline stance towards migrant arrivals.
Proactiva accuses Libyan coastguards of having saved the rest of the migrants on board the dinghy but not the two women and the child, whom they say refused to board the rescue vessel and go back to Libya.
The NGO alleges that as a result, the coastguards left them and deflated the dinghy.

Libyan coastguards have denied Proactiva's accusations.
Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini, meanwhile, denounced ""lies and insults (that) confirm that we are doing the right thing: reducing departures and landings means reducing deaths, and reducing the profits of those who speculate on illegal immigration.""
Italy and Malta are cracking down on NGO boats operating in the Mediterranean, sharply reining in their rescue efforts as they accuse them of encouraging migrants to make the perilous crossing.
Proactiva Open Arms is currently the only humanitarian aid group operating in the central Mediterranean zone, which migrants try to cross to reach Italy or Malta.
The woman who survived has identified herself as Josepha.
The rescue ship's medical team said she was in a stable condition but was traumatised and needed medical and psychological treatment ""as soon as possible.""
The team also called for the quick transfer of the two bodies, as the Open Arms ship does not have refrigeration facilities to store bodies.

The man is being treated at Melilla’s Hospital Comarcal, where he is being kept in isolation and is currently hooked up to a mechanical ventilator. His situation is critical yet stable after he experienced acute retroviral syndrome and septic shock while in hospital. Medical staff at the temporary refugee centre where the 19-year-old fell ill have so far vaccinated 226 other people to prevent the spread of meningitis. These include the doctors who first treated him and all those who shared a room with him. The centre is currently housing 1,900 immigrants, four times capacity, Spain's edition of the Huffington Post reported. The type of meningitis bacteria involved in the current case — meningococcus — is rare in Spain but much more common in African's Sahel region. Death occurs in around 10 percent of cases. Since the start of the year, Spain has experienced a very high influx of sub-Saharan immigrants attempting to enter its borders through the country’s African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. On February 6th, 15 migrants drowned in Moroccan waters while trying to swim to Ceuta from a nearby beach. Rights groups and witnesses accused Spanish security forces of firing rubber bullets at the migrants in the water. The government admitted using rubber bullets but denied its forces had targeted the migrants directly.

Last month, Spain also agreed to take in 630 migrants who arrived aboard three vessels, including the French NGO rescue ship Aquarius.
The Aquarius rescued the migrants off Libya's coast on June 9th but Italy's new populist government and Malta both refused to let it dock, triggering an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.
Then on July 4, a ship belonging to Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms docked in Barcelona with 60 migrants rescued off the Libyan coast on board after Italy refused to take them in.
Faced with growing tensions in the EU over the issue, member states struck a deal in late June to stem the arrival of migrants.
The accord includes the setting up of secure centres for migrants in the bloc, ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc and sharing out refugees among member states.
