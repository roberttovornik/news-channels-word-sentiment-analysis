					08:54 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Swedish report calls for some failed asylum seekers to get residency,"Some asylum seekers who are turned away by their home countries after having their asylum denied by Sweden should be granted residence permits to avoid years of legal limbo, a new report presented to Sweden's Migration Minister recommends.
People can get stuck for over a decade in legal limbo if their request for asylum is denied by Sweden but their home country refuses to allow them back. The new proposals would help them get a Swedish residence permit more easily in cases where the situation is beyond their control.
The idea is that rather than to wait until asylum seekers are rejected by their home countries once they are deported from Sweden, authorities should grant them Swedish residence permits in cases where it is likely that this will be the case. Authorities could predict this through assessment of the political situation in the country concerned and by looking at previous cases, for example.

""It may include stateless persons, or those from countries where institutions are so weak that it is impossible to get ID and travel documents, so that although the person cooperates, the expulsion decision cannot be carried out,"" Anna Lundberg, the government-appointed minister behind the report, explained.
""For those who are affected, it can mean 10 to 15 years of uncertainty. And should authorities also judge that the person hasn't cooperated, he or she will not be able to work,"" Lundberg said. Speaking to Dagens Nyheter, she noted that this could infringe on their human rights.
According to her predictions, the number of people granted a residence permit wouldn't see a significant increase if her proposals are passed by the government. However. those who are granted permits would receive them much sooner, preventing years of legal limbo which are damaging both to individuals and Swedish society.
Under existing legislation, it is already possible to grant residence permits in case of ""practical barriers"", but Lundberg proposes updating this legislation to be clearer in certain circumstances. Currently permits are only granted ""to a small extent, and the legislation has become more restrictive in its application over the years,"" she said.

With permits granted earlier on in the process, Lundberg claims ""they will be able to establish themselves in Swedish society instead of becoming paperless and ending up in 'shadow societies'.""
The proposed policy has met mixed reactions in Sweden.
""It is very important that this does not become a way to avoid carrying out difficult deportations. There is a risk of that, and then it suddenly affects a huge number of people,"" said Johan Forssell, migration policy spokesperson for the Moderates.
The Green Party, which has long pushed for action on the issue, welcomed the proposals. ""It probably refers to relatively few people, but they are extremely vulnerable, in a situation where they have very few rights and simply have no chance of influencing their situation,"" said Maria Ferm, MP for Migration Policy.
If the proposals in the report are passed by Swedish parliament, they would come into effect in September 2018."

					07:02 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Swedish parliament gives 1000s of young asylum seekers a chance to stay,"Sweden's parliament passed a bill on Thursday giving thousands of young asylum seekers a second chance to stay until they complete high school, after the overwhelmed migration agency failed to process their applications before they became adults.
The decision will allow thousands of asylum seekers who were minors when they arrived in Sweden to re-apply for temporary residency. Asylum rules are more favourable for minors.
Because asylum applications can take more than a year on average to process in Sweden, which has taken in more migrants per capita than any other country in Europe, some applicants turn 18 by the time their application is considered.
""We need to take political responsibility. (Asylum seekers) should not be affected because the Swedish authorities haven't managed to process their application on time,"" Maria Ferm, a lawmaker for the Greens, told TT news agency.
Passed with 166 votes against 134 with 48 abstentions, the bill was backed by the minority Social Democrats and Greens government and the Centre party while widely opposed by the conservative Moderates and the far-right Sweden Democrats.

The move exposed a rift within the centre-right Alliance before the September 9th general election in which security and immigration are the two main themes.
""The humane consequences of stopping the proposal would be far too grave,"" Annie Loof, leader of the opposition Centre Party, said in a Facebook post.
The law will enter into force on July 1st. To be considered for temporary residency, asylum seekers must re-apply by the end of September. And it is only valid for those who initially applied no later than November 24th, 2015, when Sweden tightened its asylum rules to deter migrants from travelling to Sweden.
In 2016, the Nordic nation announced it would only grant temporary three-year residence permits and limit the number of refugees who would be allowed to join family members already settled in the country.
The move was heavily criticized by human rights campaigners.
The Scandinavian country has registered 400,000 asylum applications since 2012 -- or one for every 25 inhabitants, a record in Europe -- with a peak of 162,000 applications in 2015.

					14:17 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden rejects less than a quarter of asylum seekers,"Sweden's Migration Agency accepted 77 percent of the record 112,000 asylum claims it processed in 2016, it has revealed in its end of year figures.
The agency processed twice as many decisions in 2016 as it did in 2015, putting on track to clear the backlog built up during Europe's refugee crisis.
Some 17,000 asylum seekers were registered as refugees, 47,000 were given a permit due to ""alternative needs of protection, and 5,880 withdrew their applications.
“We're handling it,” the agency's General Director Mikael Ribbenvik told Sweden's TT newswire after issuing the figures in a press statement. “In the autumn we hit a peak of 14,000 to 15,000 cases a month. But we can't keep up that pace and we don't need to either. We were a bit behind in the autumn and needed to catch up.”
He aims to keep processing 10,000 cases a month up until the summer, allowing him to clear the remaining 70,000 asylum seekers waiting for a decision.
“There's no point in us making decisions if they're not legally sound,"" he said. ""The risk of being tested in court hangs over all our decisions and if we don't handle them carefully we just end up with a court case.”
The number of asylum seekers coming to Sweden dropped to just 29,000 in 2016, down from more than 160,000 in the crisis year of 2015.
According to the Agency, this is partly as a result of Sweden's decision to tighten its rules on family reunion and permanent residency, and partly as a result of a refugee deal struck between the EU and Turkey.
The number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden has dropped the most dramatically, with just 2,200 applications compared to 35,400 in 2015.
“That can be be explained by the fact that children very often lack ID,” Ribbenvik said. “It's now difficult to get through without ID at every border control there is in Europe.”
But while the agency has done a good job speeding up processing times for asylum claims, it has diverted resources away from the processing of permits for work and other permits, leading to frustrating waits for new arrivals in the country.
""An important goal for us in 2017 is to shorten the handling time when it comes to applications for connections, work or studies,"" Ribbenvik said in a press release."

Andrey, 24, and his mother left Turkmenistan ten years ago out of fear of the repressive regime. When crossing their home country's border, they had their identification documents taken from them, and were told their Turkmen citizenship had been revoked, Swedish tabloid Expressen reports.
""When we left the country the police said we couldn't come back, and that we'd be punished by death or end up in prison as we're Christians. All our relatives were killed in Turkmenistan,"" Andrey told Expressen.

When they first arrived in Sweden in 2007, the half-Russian duo were offered jobs in southern Sweden by a Russian man. For two years they worked for the man, until he moved.
In 2009, for the first time since arriving in the Nordic nation they were informed that they could seek asylum from the Migration Agency (Migrationsverket), which they did. But their applications were rejected. They appealed, but lost and were again told they had to leave the country.
In February this year, they were forced to leave their flat in Kiruna, in Sweden's far north, and ended up living on the streets in the freezing cold.
A neighbour eventually helped them buy tickets to Finland, thinking they might be able to get asylum there. But as Finland is also a member of the EU, and as the two had already applied for asylum in Sweden, they were sent back.
After being escorted by Finnish police officers to Stockholm Arlanda, the pair decided the only option was to live in the capital's main airport. As they have refused to cooperate on their return to Turkmenistan, they are no longer entitled to accommodation or daily allowances from Migrationsverket.
""We sit here, day after day, week after week. Some days we don't have anything to eat,"" Andrey told Expressen.
Turkmenistan refuses to allow Andrey and his mother back into the country. As they are Russian speakers, Migrationsverket has also tried deporting the two to Russia.
Swedavia, the company that runs Arlanda and other major airports in Sweden, has tried to help the pair that spent a month living in the airport terminals, according to Adam Ekman, press spokesperson at Swedavia.
""We've been in contact with the authorities and tried to solve this issue, to the extent possible. And we've handed out some food coupons, blankets and fruit,"" Ekman told The Local.

Has this ever happened before – that people waiting to be deported end up living at your airport?
""Not as far as I'm aware. It's out of the ordinary for something like this to happen,"" Ekman said.
What's Swedavia's view on this, having people stranded at Arlanda waiting to be deported?
""It's sad and regrettable that people get trapped in this way. In this particular case we feel that we've done as much as we possible can to resolve this situation,"" Ekman said.
Migrationsverket does not comment on individual cases, but Pierre Karatzian at the agency's press office confirmed they are aware of the situation. The reason why Andrey and his mother are not entitled to food or a place to sleep despite being rejected re-entry into Turkmenistan is due to a recent law change.
""The government and the Riksdag decided last year on this new law which meant that people who do not cooperate with their return can lose their right to accommodation and daily allowance. In those cases, where an asylum application has been rejected, you do have the option to appeal, and then a migration court will decide if Migrationsverket's decision was correct,"" Karatzian explained.

Karatzian stressed, however, that Andrey and his mother are free to leave the airport.
""The fact that these people are at Arlanda, that is something they have chosen for themselves. That's not something we have decided. They're not trapped at the airport, so to speak,"" Karatzian told The Local.
Migrationsverket's figures from January 2016 until now show that 6771 people have had their rights to accommodation and daily allowance revoked. Out of those people, approximately 443 have appealed that decision, according to Karatzian.
Karatzian and Adam Ekman at Swedavia said Andrey and his mother finally left Arlanda this week. Their exact whereabouts are unknown."

The UN organization says that neither Sweden nor any other Nordic countries are meeting the requirements in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
It cites the example of children who are taken into care because their parents are judged to be unfit to care for them, but are then later deported with the same parents anyway if their guardians receive a deportation notice.

Unicef also criticised the age-assessment process of asylum seekers as inadequate, as well as pointing out that children rarely speak during the asylum process in Sweden, despite the children sometimes themselves having grounds to claim asylum, such as due to the risk of child marriage.
""The report shows that despite Sweden being considered a world leader in children's rights there are major shortcomings when it comes to asylum seeking children and their rights. It can look good on paper, but in reality there are significant weaknesses,"" Unicef Sweden's Christina Heilborn said in a statement..
There are also positive comments about Sweden in the report. In particular the country is cited as a good example in how it gives all children the right to attend school, even during the asylum process.
Healthcare is also highlighted as a good example from Sweden's part, where children in the asylum process have access to it under similar terms to other children.

					08:36 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Asylum seekers should do more to prove their identities: Swedish minister,"Swedish Interior Minister Anders Ygeman thinks the proof of ID required when submitting an asylum application in the country is too low, and wants to see the standard toughened.
“If you don’t have an identity document, I think the burden has to be placed clearly on the individual to prove their identity,” Ygeman told Swedish news agency TT in an interview.
An inability or unwillingness to show identity documents can hamper the assessment of whether an asylum seeker has grounds for protection, as well as whether they should be returned to their country of origin if the application is rejected.
In 2016 around 60 percent of asylum seekers in Sweden showed some form of identity document early in the asylum process.
“There’s an image which has been spread by traffickers and others that the best situation is to not have an identity, and that you shouldn’t have a passport with you. That’s a false image,” Ygeman noted.
The minister emphasized that according to Swedish and international regulations it should be very difficult for asylum to be granted to anyone who does not help to clarify their identity. And he is critical of how the regulations have been applied so far in Sweden.
“Basically it is the asylum seeker who is responsible for making an identity credible. That has come to be interpreted slightly differently in Swedish law, but it has to be the foundation,” he said.
Sweden's centre-right Moderates have backed Ygeman's call. Moderate migration policy spokesperson Johan Forssell said that his party believes too little responsibility has been placed on the asylum seeker, and the burden of providing proof has been reversed.
“The position is instead that it is the authority tasked with disproving the individual, we have seen that when it comes to determining age,” Forssell noted.
In September, Sweden decided to adopt a new model of medical age assessment for unaccompanied asylum seekers, which will do so by examining teeth and knee joints.
Sweden's Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) and police have suggested to the Swedish government that it should consider granting them new powers to help establish identities.
One proposal is for the police to be able to check telephones and computers to look for evidence of identity, as well as on social media. Being able to body search asylum seekers during the asylum process, as police in Norway can currently do, is another.
But Ygeman emphasized that those proposals are delicate, and that the government must analyze them before taking any position:
“There is a legal problem there because that could involve coercive measures against someone who is not suspected of a crime.""
In a report, the Migration Agency and police highlighted coordination problems such as people being convicted of a crime in Sweden under one identity, but having another identity registered with the Migration Agency.
“That shouldn’t be able to happen. You should only have one identity and that identity should be linked to biometrics like fingerprints,” Ygeman insisted.
Another proposal is for asylum seekers who do not cooperate in clarifying their identity to be made to disclose their whereabouts and have a fixed residence.
“Generally it’s reasonable for you to have a place of residence where you are, and for that to be known to the authorities. That applies to everyone else in society,” Ygeman concluded.
An established identity is a prerequisite if rejected asylum seekers are to be returned to their homeland. The Migration Agency estimates in its most recent prognosis that 88,000 return decisions will be taken during the period 2016-2018, half of which will return voluntarily.
Ygeman thinks it is important for the pace to pick up however, including in forcible returns:
“Primarily it is important to show that you can’t choose for yourself, as well as to encourage people to return voluntarily.""
So far in 2016 around 18,000 asylum seekers have returned to their home countries or another country from Sweden. Of those, 2,400 were returned by force."

The new system, unveiled in September by the national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket), is designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate.
The Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket) has previously been criticized for failings in its initial age assessments of applicants, with some municipalities reporting suspected cases of adults being registered as a children and placed into residential care homes for young people or sent to school.
The first cases in which the new method will be used are to be sent from Migrationsverket to Rättsmedicinalverket on Tuesday. From 3,000 to as many as 14,000 lone refugee children and youths are expected to be affected by the new process, according to the migration authority.
The method of medical age assessment to be used consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The first results are expected to be ready within a few weeks.

The Swedish requirement for ID checks at the border between the two countries has resulted in 10,000 people being turned away from the ferry, that connects the Danish town of Helsingør with Helsingborg in Sweden.
Almost all of the rejections were due to normal travellers forgetting to bring their papers, reports Danish broadcaster DR.
ID and border checks were introduced on 4th January this year in an effort to prevent asylum seeker without papers from travelling to Sweden to seek asylum.
Only 200 hundred of the 10,000 recorded refusals during 2016 were potential asylum seekers, according to the report.
""The majority of the people we refuse boarding are Scandinavian citizens, mostly Swedes. We're obviously all used to travelling in a region where mobility is in flow,"" Henrik Rørbæk, administrative director of HH Ferries, told DR.
""It is a big procedure for the sake of relatively small figures. And in general, the flow of asylum seekers up here has not been very great. It also shouldn't be any secret that this is costing us large amounts each month,"" Rørbæk continued.
Rørbæk told DR that the ID checks cost the company three million Swedish kronor ($325,000) every month.
Over three million passengers passed through HH's ID checks in 2016, reports DR.
The company must pay fines of up to 50,000 kronor ($5,400) every time a passenger is stopped by Swedish border control without ID.
""Most people are understanding, but many others blame us for not being able to travel. So if I could have a little Christmas present, it would be that we found more convenient ways in which to maintain the border checks, so that they don't disadvantage individual travellers,"" said Rørbæk.
The director added that his company did not take any political position with regard to the ID checks.
Opposition party Enhedslisten (The Red-Green Alliance) decried the ID checks as a 'waste of resources'.
""These figures show that this border control is a bit silly. It does not stop criminals or asylum seekers, and in practice just cost money and inconveniences people,"" legal spokesperson Pernille Skipper told DR.
But Integration Minister Inger Støjberg told the broadcaster that she was not about to reconsider border control.
""We know that things can change very quickly and that a large number of asylum seekers who possibly want to travel on to Sweden might come here, and get stuck here, so as long as the Swedes maintain their ID checks, I see no reason why we should lift our border control,"" Støjberg said.
Martin Henriksen of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party told DR that if it was up to his party, it would ""always be necessary to show a passport to enter Denmark. Even for people coming from Sweden."""

""It's an enormous challenge. It will require a strong boost of resources and modified working methods. We need to work closer to the Migration Agency and get these cases earlier.

Floating Accommodations has been fighting to keep the Ocean Gala at Utansjö port on the Sweden's east coast ever since Härnösand municipality denied it the right to reside there last April. The municipality subsequently banned the ship from docking in its harbour.
And on Friday, the Östersund regional Land and Environment Court threw out an appeal from the company against the ban. That decision could bring an end to a complicated dispute over the future of the boat as a form of asylum accommodation in Sweden.
The argument dates back to February, when Sweden signed a deal with the shipping firm to lodge 1,800 asylum seekers aboard the Ocean Gala. The original plan was to dock the vessel in Härnösand’s Utansjö port, but the municipality vetoed hosting the ship.
Swedish migration board Migrationsverket accepted that veto in April, before scrapping the accommodation agreement with the shipping firm entirely on July 7th, saying it was void after they failed to secure the necessary permits.
The authority also rejected a demand from the firm that it should be paid 800,000 kronor ($93,786) per day to cover the rent of the places on the ship. But the argument wasn’t finished.
It soon dragged on when Floating Accommodations responded by docking the Ocean Gala at Utansjö anyway, arguing that it did not require planning permission to do so. As soon as the ship had docked, Härnösand municipality reported the owner of the port to the police, saying it was not entitled to host the ship.
Floating Accommodations argued that the municipality had campaigned against them to stop their project, and appealed against its ban from the Utansjö port to the Östersund Land and Environment Court.
But with that appeal today rejected by the court, it could finally be time for the Ocean Gala to set sail."

Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 – more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants, according to data released by Eurostat last week.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local.
“In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.

A post on the Facebook page of the Russian Embassy in Stockholm earlier in March responded to criticism from Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallström by blaming Sweden for the conflict in the Ukraine, saying it was caused by ""the will of the West, not least Sweden as an instigator of the EU's Eastern Partnership, to do everything to push Kiev into the European Union"".
""Many Ukrainian nationals, who applied for asylum in Sweden, were those, who were already in a European country, for example, working or studying (sur place protection seekers), when the situation in Ukraine had changed,"" Zelvenska explained.
The Ukrainian embassy in Stockholm was unavailable for comment this week, telling The Local that its current ambassador was out of the country, with a new one scheduled to start next month.
The Ukrainian community appears to be putting its mark on the Swedish capital. Online groups for Ukrainian expats are growing in size, several Ukrainian musicians are scheduled to visit the city this year and the first Nordic Ukrainian Film Festival opens on April 20th.
Of those who applied for asylum across the EU in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try – 2,335.
Sweden rejected eight times as many Ukrainian applicants in their first instances as they accepted, with just 20 receiving positive outcomes compared to 160 rejections.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won’t issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it’s not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
Germany was the country that received the highest number of Ukrainian asylum requests at 2,705, Eurostat reported – 18 times greater than the number in 2013, 150. They accepted 20 in the first instance, but rejected another 45.
But the numbers have so far decreased this year, Zelvenska told The Local.
""Recent number of asylum applications by Ukrainian asylum seekers in Europe indeed increased in 2014, but have so far been decreasing in 2015. In general, the numbers still remain quite low, for example, in February 2015 only 125 Ukrainians applied for asylum in Europe,"" she said.
Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013."

					14:24 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Number of asylum seekers to Sweden dropped sharply in 2016,"Following the introduction of border controls, an agreement with Turkey and tougher legislation, the flow of refugees to Sweden has reduced to a trickle.
2016 saw 80 per cent fewer asylum seekers arrive in Sweden compared with 2015, when almost 163,000 people applied for asylum in the country.
This year's total is significantly lower.
For example, only 5,410 Syrian asylum seekers have come to Sweden so far in 2016, compared with 51,338 in 2015, according to figures from the Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket).
Up to mid-December, the total for asylum seekers arriving in the country in 2016 had just rounded 28,000.
According to Fredrik Bengtsson, press officer with Migrationsverket, the reduction in numbers is the result of a variation of factors at play in both Sweden and the EU.
""We have an agreement on refugees between Turkey and the EU, as well as significantly reduced abilities for asylum seekers to travel across European borders. In Sweden we have changed legislation such that Sweden is no longer considered an optimal destination in the same way. We no longer grant permanent residency and family reunification has been severely limited,"" Bengtsson told news agency TT.
The biggest overall reduction was in the numbers of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden. Around 2,100 unaccompanied under-18 year-olds applied for asylum this year, compared with 35,369 in 2015.
""Last year the absolute majority of unaccompanied minors were from Afghanistan, where they are usually without identity papers. This makes it difficult for them to reach Sweden as they will be stopped at various forms of ID checkpoints on the way,"" said Bengtsson.
The press chief declined to comment on how the situation is likely to look this time next year, but told TT that this will depend upon developments with Swedish laws - but to a greater degree on decisions taken outside of the country.
Whether the agreement with Turkey, for example, or individual border controls continues will depend upon the actions of other [countries], Bengtsson said.
""But if we look at the amount of people that still need to flee from war, this has not changed. It is still great,"" continued Bengtsson."

Swedish ID checks on buses, trains and ferries between the country and Denmark were dropped last week for the first time since they were brought in at the start of 2016. At the same time, the Swedish government announced that it would strengthen border control spot checks by police to cover more travellers.
And border police in the south of Sweden say that in the four days since the ID checks stopped on May 4th their controls detected 24 people looking to seek asylum in Sweden, up from an average of five per week earlier in 2017.
""I think its just the start of what could happen in the future. First the message of the ID checks being taken away has to catch on before we can see the bigger effect here in Sweden,"" Michael Mattsson, head of Sweden's Border Police in the south region told Sveriges radio.
Migrationsverket's figures do not yet show an increase in the number of asylum seekers. Last week 328 people sought asylum in Sweden, a decrease compared to the week before where the number was 384, as well as lower than two weeks ago (347). There can be a delay in applications entering the system however.

The agency believes that there is a greater likelihood of more people seeking asylum in Sweden than previously predicted now that the ID controls have been eliminated, but despite that say they so far have no reason to change their latest forecast for the number of people expected to seek asylum in the country during 2017.
An April 26th forecast predicted that the number of people expected to seek asylum in Sweden over the course of the year will fall between a low of 22,000 and a high of 45,000, with the estimate for planning purposes set at 34,700. The forecast includes provisions for an increase in the number of asylum seekers during the coming summer and autumn.
""What we see now is that the likelihood of the lowest scenario has decreased, and we can see a development bringing it closer to the number estimated for planning purposes. The likelihood of a large increase, which would see numbers move closer to the highest scenario, is judged to be small,"" Migrationsverket analyst Arvid Zheng Norin said in a statement.

Sweden has experienced a slow in the number of refugees seeking asylum since it introduced systematic photo identification checks on trains, bus and ferry passengers entering via Denmark and Germany in January.
But the country's migration board said on Thursday that numbers could rise again as it released its official arrivals forecast, suggesting that up to 140,000 people might seek new lives in the Nordic country this year.
""This crisis is definitely not over,"" Anders Danielsson, the agency's director, told Swedish media.
""One can hardly speak of forecasts now. The future depends entirely on the decisions and actions taken at the European Union level and in Sweden,"" he added in a statement.
His carefully chosen comments came days after Sweden's Home Affairs Minister Anders Ygeman suggested that the agency's prognoses were ""worthless"". He later clarified that this was because he also believed that a variety of factors could change the projection, rather than due to a mistrust in the agency.
The migration agency said it was basing its 2016 planning on a scenario of around 100,000 asylum seekers, but gave an upper estimate of 140,000 should Turkish and European authorities be overwhelmed and if Swedish border controls prove ineffective.
Conversely, if border controls work properly and more restrictive measures are put in place, Sweden might receive as few as 70,000 migrants.
""We need to steer the number down towards 70,000 and preferably even under that,"" Immigration Minister Morgan Johansson told reporters.
""If we see the numbers beginning to rise to a level that we can't manage, then we'll have to do more.""

Sweden, a country of 9.8 million, was one of the EU states with the highest proportion of refugees per capita last year as Europe battles its worst migration crisis since World War Two.
At a peak in October, Sweden received around 10,000 asylum requests a week, compared to less than 1,000 a week now.
But Sweden's capacities are under strain, with rising concern about conditions in overcrowded asylum facilities and tensions between migrants and locals.
In late January, Sweden said it expected that around 45 percent of those who sought asylum last year be rejected, forecasting the expulsion of up to 80,000 people."

A video showing the driver punching an asylum seeker on Öland, an island off the east coast of Sweden, went viral last month after regional newspaper Barometern first published it.
The passenger, Mohammed, and bus driver both reported the alleged assault to the police, with the driver claiming he had been hit on the arm during the altercation and had received a fracture.
Nobina, the bus company, told The Local at the time that it had launched an internal investigation of the incident alongside the police probe, with a spokesperson describing it as ""tragic"" and ""unacceptable"".
The driver has now been fired, reports Sweden's public broadcaster.
""We believe he did the wrong thing,"" press officer Mahdi Ahmadi told SVT, but declined to elaborate.
""We do not comment on internal staffing issues.""
Speaking to regional newspaper Östra Småland last month, the driver admitted to hitting the other man, but said that the whole story had not been told, referring to previous conflicts between bus drivers and Öland asylum seekers which he said had sparked tension.
""I should not have acted the way I did. It was stupid. I have to accept the consequences. But saying that what happened was completely unprovoked is simply not true,"" he said.
Muhammed, who fled war-torn Syria last autumn after his brothers were killed, meanwhile told The Local that the incident had left him ""shocked"" and ""humiliated"".
""I don't know why or how even that happened, I never expected this could happen to me in Sweden. (…) I still can't understand it. I've left Syria to avoid being beaten or killed, and I found myself being beaten in Sweden – that's shocking.""
However, he said he refused to let the experience change his overall impression of his new home.
""I don't want this case to be used for accusing the Swedes: xenophobes, racists or whatever. I don't want it to be used for generalization, the Swedes are not bad people and they have already helped many refugees."""

Hundreds of young refugees watched from the gallery as a debate was held in the Riksdag on Wednesday over the situation for unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden. It follows a sit-down protest by young asylum seekers in Stockholm that started in August, where demonstrators argue that deportations to Afghanistan should be stopped because the country is not safe.
Among the speakers at the debate were Migration Minister Heléne Fritzon, who dismissed calls for an amnesty.
""Those who have an asylum application rejected must of course leave,"" she said, insisting that Sweden has one of the most legally sound asylum systems and offers strong rights for asylum seekers.
The Green Party's migration spokesperson Maria Ferm argued however that a legal solution should be found so that the young Afghans who came as unaccompanied asylum seekers in 2015 can stay:
""Afghanistan is one of the world's most dangerous countries, and there are very few opportunities to start any kind of normal life for those who return there without a network"".
The Swedish Migration Agency's official stance on Afghanistan is that safety varies between the country’s different provinces and that ""it is still possible to return to several areas"".

Ferm said that long processing times at the Swedish Migration Agency was a problem for the youngsters, with many turning 18 by the time their case was was looked at, meaning they were therefore processed as adults despite arriving in Sweden when they were underage:
""We don't want to see thousands of young asylum seekers getting deportation notices, and we don't want them to get it this autumn after being made to wait several years for the decision"".
Migration Minister Fritzon said she does not believe new legislation is required in response however. From the opposition parties, the Sweden Democrats and Moderates defended the current system, while the Centre Party argued that a new solution is necessary.
""To date this year seven people from this group have taken their own lives, roughly around 100 have tried. I understand that may sound macabre but from my perspective you can't start anywhere but there when talking about this group,"" Centre Party migration spokesperson Johanna Jönsson said.

MEP Cecilia Wikström from Sweden's Liberals has been tasked with steering reforms of the Dublin Regulation through the European Parliament by finding proposals which will be backed by a majority. The regulation covers which EU country is responsible for processing an asylum seeker.
In a new article in Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN), Wikström writes that attempts to redeploy around 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece between EU nations has been a complete fiasco, and that in order for member countries to equally share the responsibility, an automatic distribution mechanism should be created.
""A distribution scale is being drawn up based on GDP and population, in which every country's share of the responsibility is clear. When a member state fulfils its part of the joint responsibility, asylum seekers that arrive there would be distributed to other countries,"" Wikström notes.
Border nations are well aware that many asylum seekers will travel onwards to countries like Sweden and Germany, Wikström argues, and that it is difficult to return an asylum seeker to the first EU nation they arrived in if they were not registered in the union's common database.
In other words, there is an incentive for both border nations and the countries asylum seekers then travel through not to register applicants in the database, which Wikström wants to change.
Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum applications during the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015. The number dropped sharply to 29,000 in 2016.
The Dublin Regulation was signed in 1990 in order to set the criteria for EU nations regarding the responsibility of processing asylum applications. It was reformed in 2003, then again in 2013. It applies to all 28 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

Hanif Mohammadi was surrounded by animals on his family's farm in rural Afghanistan when the Taliban killed his parents and forced him to flee.
Now, the 17-year-old is an asylum seeker in Stockholm and doing what he does best: herding goats.
Wearing running shoes, jeans and a light brown sweater with his pitch-black hair tied back, Mohammadi checks his smartphone just like any ordinary teen as he follows a flock of goats in the green meadows of Lidingö, an island in the inner archipelago of Stockholm.
""In Afghanistan, we had a lot of goats and sheep so when I came to Lidingö... I wanted to help out and learn a little Swedish,"" he says.
He's been living in Sweden for a year and a half, anxiously waiting for his asylum request to be processed.
Mohammadi, who is from Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold, said the insurgents killed his father after he refused to join them. His uncle helped him escape before he ended up in Sweden.
""In Afghanistan, my life was really tough because I lost my parents... my family,"" he tells AFP.

Holding back his tears, Mohammadi says: ""I received a phone call last summer saying (the Taliban) had killed my uncle too"".
Surrounded by goats under a bright blue sky in Lidingö, Mohammadi is far away from the violence in his nation, in a home away from home.
And whenever he finds time off from school, Mohammadi joins his mammal friends.
He pulls down a tree branch to help the goats nibble on the leaves as one of the animals puts its front hooves on his waist to stand on its hind legs. Mohammadi bursts into laughter.
'Keeping Sweden beautiful'
Henrik Ponten is the chairman of a community called ""Get2Gether"" which humourously refers to ""get"" (""goat"" in Swedish).
With help from volunteers and asylum seekers, the community focuses on the conservation of an endangered Swedish goat species, whose milk is used to produce cheese at a factory in Lidingö.
""(The boys) come out into society and create new contacts in Sweden,"" Ponten tells AFP. He says that herding helps asylum seekers better integrate.
""They're very competent and good at herding because they've done it before,"" he adds. ""More importantly, they get to contribute to keeping Sweden beautiful.""
Afghans constitute by far the highest number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden.
While the asylum process can take more than a year on average, a majority of Afghan minors have their applications approved, according to the Swedish Migration Agency's 2016 figures.
Around 1600 asylum applications by Afghan minors were submitted to the agency by the end of November 2016. Around 500 were rejected.
In a security assessment published earlier this month, the agency deemed some regions in Afghanistan such as Panjshir, Bamiyan and Daikundi ""less dangerous"" despite ""increasing violence"" in the war-torn country.
'You'll get killed'
The migration agency said that not everyone from Afghanistan will ""automatically receive protection in Sweden"" despite ""a gradual deterioration"" in security.

He's been in Sweden for 18 months and while he waits to be granted a permanent residency to start a new life, herding is an opportunity to put his skills to use.
""I know how to take care of goats (because) I'm used to being around them,"" he says as he giggles at one of the bleating animals.

Robel Kidane had meant to travel from Osby to Vellinge in southern Sweden but stepped on the wrong train, and by the time he realized his mistake was already on the other side of the border, newspaper Sydsvenskan reports.
When border police at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport on August 11th saw the boy's official asylum seeker photo ID, they understood that something was wrong and contacted the asylum home where he lived in Vellinge.
Staff at the home then got in touch with Kidane's legal guardian in Sweden, Thorild Hamfors.
He in turn phoned the Migration Agency to explain the mistake – a decision he now regrets.
Hamfors had hoped for help, but instead the boy was registered as having left Sweden, where he has lived since last August. The 17-year-old also lost the right to return to the asylum accommodation in Vellinge, and will most likely have to reapply for asylum if he manages to return.
“It's a catastrophe as far as his wellbeing is concerned,” Hamfors told Sydsvenskan. “The [Migration Agency's] case officer was just about to make a decision regarding permanent residency. Now it starts again, and will take at least another year.”
Sweden's tough new asylum rules mean Robel Kidane will no longer be able to apply for permanent residency and can hope for a temporary permit at best.
The Red Cross and the Migration Agency said they knew of several similar cases since the introduction of border checks.
Mikael Kinning, who works with the Red Cross in Vellinge, criticized the migration agency's bureaucratic response to the error.
“There's no empathy for the person here: a teenager who goes to school in Vellinge, who has a support family that cares about him, and a home where he is liked,” he told Sydsvenskan."

US-based Swedish shipping magnate Floating Accommodations filed the complaints about Härnösand municipality, which denied the ship the right to reside at Utansjö port on the country's easy coast.
Sweden had signed a deal with the shipping firm to lodge 1,800 asylum seekers aboard the Ocean Gala. But on July 7th, the country's migration board Migrationsverket cancelled the agreement, saying it was ""null and void"" after the owners of the ship had failed to secure the permits it required.
The migration authority also rejected the company's request that it should be paid 800,000 kronor ($93,786) per day to cover the rent of the near 2000 places on the ship.
Floating Accommodations now argues that the Härnösand municipality – which vetoed hosting the ship – had campaigned against them to stop their project.
“The real offender is the authority, which used funds, an abuse of power, threats, official contacts and harassment otherwise only seen in old gangster movies,” claimed the company's complaint filed to the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman.
In April, Sweden's migration authority accepted Härnösand municipality's right to veto hosting the Ocean Gala in the Utansjö port. But in June, Floating Accommodations chose to dock the ship in the port anyway, arguing that planning permission was not required.
Härnösand municipality then reported the owner of the port to the police, saying that it was not entitled to host the ship."

A video of the incident, published by Barometern.
Muhammed, who fled war-torn Syria after his brothers were killed and arrived in Sweden in October, said he was left stunned by what he described as an unprovoked assault, forcing him to seek hospital care on Tuesday evening.
""I don't know why or how even that happened, I never expected this could happen to me in Sweden. This incident felt really humiliating to me, I still can't understand it. I've left Syria to avoid being beaten or killed, and I found myself being beaten in Sweden – that's shocking.""
However, he said he refused to let the experience change his overall impression of his new home.
""I don't want this case to be used for accusing the Swedes: xenophobes, racists or whatever. I don't want it to be used for generalization, the Swedes are not bad people and they have already helped many refugees,"" he told The Local.
A spokesperson from the bus company, Nobina, said that the driver has been removed from service and that an internal investigation has been launched.
""I've only seen the video, but it's incredibly tragic and unpleasant to watch, and of course it's unacceptable and nothing we support,"" press officer Eric Steijer told The Local.
""[The driver's] line manager has been in contact with him, but I don't know the details of that conversation. It's important to us that this is properly investigated and acted on correctly from the start,"" he said, adding that the bus firm would attempt to contact the Syrian passenger to offer an apology.
The incident was reported to the police on Tuesday. The bus driver is also understood to have filed a similar report for violence against an official, telling officers he received a slap on the arm during the altercation.

					16:16 CET+01:00				", The Local,In figures: Why do asylum seekers come to Sweden?,"A new report by a Swedish analysis firm sheds light on why refugees seek asylum in Sweden.
Quizzing more than 400 asylum seekers, analysts at Sweden Research found that the main reason they had chosen to come to Sweden was its long period of peace – Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace in 2014 – and its reputation as one of the world's most family-friendly countries.
In fact, a total of 74 percent of respondents picked peace as their main reason for travelling to Sweden.
""Some of them considered also the benefits of the good education for teens and children, expressing that Sweden is a good country to raise children,"" read the report.
Around six percent of respondents stated that they chose Sweden because of its generous economic subsidy to refugees, but 24 percent said they believed there were good opportunities to find work and 19 percent said they picked it because it was generous in accepting refugees.
The two latter points are debatable. The country tigthened its asylum laws significantly earlier this year. And according to the national jobs agency Arbetsförmedlingen, 21.6 percent of people born outside of Sweden were unemployed in August, compared to 4.2 percent of native Swedes.
Every fourth respondent nevertheless told the survey that their expectations in Sweden had been exceeded, but just as many believed that they had not been fulfilled. However, a whopping 95 percent stated that they intended to stay in Sweden after they get their residence permit.
One in five said they had been exposed to racism from officials or civilians in Sweden. They said they had got the best reception from Migration Agency workers and their children's school, but said asylum accommodation and job agency staff had been responsible for the worst treatment.

Half of the asylum seekers questioned said they had had problems with their physical health. Half of these had also received treatment for their conditions. One in three respondents said they wanted to see a psychologist but had not got the opportunity.
""Recurrent themes causing weariness and malaise are created by loneliness, being far away from their family members, worries about these and their situation in the country of origin, pressure at the asylum accommodation and worries about their future in Sweden, often a general concern about the upcoming decision on their asylum application, and often with added concern as the waiting time gets prolonged,"" stated the report.""
Carlos Rojas, head of Sweden Research, said: ""We started conducting this study when we noticed that everyone was talking about asylum seekers, but no one was talking with them. (…) Developing methods, structures and activities for the asylum seekers requires better knowledge about how they perceive their situation.""
Sweden Research interviewed 456 asylum seekers from countries including Syria and Somalia in 16 different towns across Sweden between November 2015 and May 2016 for the report 'Asylum seekers in Sweden – thoughts, plans and feelings'. The majority of respondents also filled out a written questionnaire."

The video showing the driver abusing an asylum seeker on Öland, an island off the east coast of Sweden, went viral after regional newspaper Barometern first wrote about the incident. The Local interviewed the Syrian victim on Wednesday, who said it had left him shocked and humiliated.
The driver, who has been suspended pending a police and an internal investigation, shared his version of events for the first time with the Östra Småland newspaper on Friday. He said he had also been injured in the altercation, with a fracture in his arm forcing him to take sick leave until August 31st.
""Of course you should not act the way it looks like I acted in the video. But there is a story before this that has not been told,"" he said.
He told the newspaper that the violent incident was sparked by previous conflicts between bus drivers and some of the residents at the asylum centre on northern Öland.
""Most of the asylum seekers on Öland are very nice people. But there have been problems with some of them. They never stand at the stops, but demand that you should stop wherever they are. They get off for a smoke or run to the store when you pick up other passengers and demand that you should wait. Some have not paid,"" he said.

The Syrian man, who arrived in Sweden in October after fleeing his war-torn country when his brothers were killed, told The Local on Wednesday that the driver had closed the doors in his face when he tried to catch the bus. But according to the driver the man never indicated that he wanted to get on board.
When the passenger got on the bus at the next stop, he snapped a picture of the driver, who told Östra Småland that he next got up and tried to take a picture of the Syrian man, but the phone was knocked out of his hand when he received a slap on the arm. He then hit the man and shouted ""I hate you damn swines.""
""It's of course stupid. I'm definitely not a racist, many of my friends are from other countries. What I mean by shouting that is that group that can't behave,"" he told the paper on Friday.
""I should not have acted the way I did. It was stupid. I have to accept the consequences. But saying that what happened was completely unprovoked is simply not true.""
A spokesperson for the company, Nobina, told The Local earlier in the week that an internal investigation has been launched into the incident, alongside a police investigation. The driver himself has also reported the man to the police for violence against an official.
Another spokesperson for Nobina said on Friday that the traffic manager for the region had tried to speak to the driver after the interview with Östra Småland, but had not been able to reach him. The Local has attempted to contact the union representative."

					16:25 CET+01:00				", The Local,Sweden cuts predicted asylum seeker figures,"Fewer refugees than previously predicted are expected to arrive in Sweden in 2015, as the conflict in Libya cuts off land routes from Eritrea to Europe.
A new prognosis by Sweden’s Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) brings the number of predicted asylum seekers down from the figure of 95,000 suggested in November 2014 to 90,000. Fredrik Bengtsson, a spokesman for Migrationsverket, told The Local that armed conflicts in Northern Africa are making it more difficult for migrants to get to Europe. “The main reason for the predicted number going down is that it has become more dangerous to travel through Africa to Europe. This leads to costs of smuggling people across borders going up, which affects people from a poorer background more than people from a wealthier background. So we are still seeing a lot of Syrians migrating to Sweden, but fewer Eritreans.” But on the whole Migrationsverket expects the numbers to remain at their highest ever. “Our ‘main scenario’ has gone down, but we are still within the margin of error. The larger interval we’re operating within is still between 80,000 and 105,000 refugees. Last year the number of asylum seekers was 81,000. That can be compared to 1992 during the conflict in former Yugoslavia, but the difference now is that we’re seeing this over a longer period of time,” said Fredrik Bengtsson. “The situation in the world is not getting better and we are expecting very many people to still want to come to Sweden. But the most important thing is not the number of asylum seekers as such, but rather that the country Sweden begins to plan for their arrival. Migrationsverket’s prognoses are our way of flagging this up to the government, to tell them to start organising schools, housing and so on.”
To help municipalities in Sweden manage the growing numbers of migrants, Migrationsverket is set to trial a new public procurement model for housing centres, to cap the numbers of asylum seekers being lodged in municipalities which have already accepted a large number. “Through the new model we hope to be able to better decide where new housing centres for asylum seekers are opened,” said Fredrik Bengtsson. Sweden currently takes in more refugees per capita than any other European country. It received asylum applications from 54,259 people in 2013, up from 29,648 2011."

The numbers of deportations involving the use of force also increased by 500 to 2,200 cases.
The Church of Sweden (Svenska Kyrkan), which offers support and advice to refugees, has criticized the upturn in expulsions.
""What was most noticeable was the use of chartered planes to Iraq. This was a new way of enforcing deportation - filling chartered planes with deported asylum seekers,"" Kristina Hellqvist, responsible for refugee issues at the Church of Sweden, told Sveriges Radio (SR).
""You get an ultimatum: sign a document that you are prepared to return willingly or your case becomes a matter for the police.""
During 2009 the national migration agency received extra funding to accelerate the repatriation of asylum seekers whose applications to stay in Sweden had been rejected.
""For me it is obvious that if your asylum application has not been accepted then you must return home. In that sense every year is 'return home year',"" said Billström."

The country approved 24,015 asylum applications in 2013 and rejected 20,990, according to figures from the EU’s Eurostat agency. A total of 6,750 people were given refugee status, 16,145 were given subsidiary protection and 1,120 were allowed to stay for humanitarian reasons.

Fifty thousand of these came from Syria, although the EU’s 28 countries took just a fraction of the 2.5 million registered refugees fleeing the country’s three-year conflict.

Rabi Hanna left Syria in his twenties and spent five years working in IT in Africa - earning good money and regularly travelling to Europe to visit friends and family.
But during a Christmas break to Stockholm in 2012, the company he had been based at in Ghana ran into trouble and phoned him to cancel his contract, just as the war was intensifying in his home country.
""I couldn't go back to Ghana without a job and I couldn't go home to Syria because of the war,” Rabi explains.
""One minute I was on holiday in Sweden, the next, I was stranded here. It was really horrible.""
Rabi decided to seek asylum in Sweden and had his application accepted four months later.
""It didn't take too long but it wasn't an easy time. Getting an apartment in Stockholm was tricky without a job and it was hard to get a job without knowing Swedish. I kept having to move around and this is an expensive place to live if you are not working.""
Despite more than a decade of experience in the IT world, Rabi accepted an unpaid internship as his first step into the Swedish economy.
""I was lucky, I made a great, kind contact who helped me with my CV and with applications and then I managed to get a good job in my industry. Now I am in my second job in Sweden.""
Rabi enjoys living in Sweden, but misses the Syrian sun. Photo: Private
Rabi's current role is Chief Technology Officer at Miss Group, a new Swedish start-up specialising in web services including domain registration, hosting, broking and management. He is the only non-Swede at the company.
""I speak English with my colleagues at work, although I am learning Swedish,"" he says.
""It has taken me longer than I had hoped to pick up the language. It is difficult to find the time when you are working so hard"".
While Rabi enjoys socialising with other international expats in Sweden, he says he is determined to improve his language skills in order to integrate further into Swedish society.
""You can communicate with people wherever you go, because most people speak English. But you have to speak Swedish to really settle here,"" he argues.
""You need Swedish for your social life.""
Rabi's home town in Syria, Kamishli, has managed to escape the bloodshed felt in other parts of the country, but he saved up to help his parents relocate over the border to Lebanon in 2014 and hopes that other members of his family may eventually join him in Sweden.
""I just want to know that they are somewhere safe,"" he says.
As for Sweden's approach to taking in Syrian migrants, he is a strong supporter of what he describes as ""an efficient system"".
""It is not easy for everyone who moves to Sweden. But I like the people here. They want to help others. I like the way the system works. People follow the rules""."

The Swedish National Migration Board (Migrationsverket) has been forced to rent camps and other temporary accommodations to deal with the acute housing shortage.
Many small municipalities which have been forced to take in large numbers of applicants applicants on short notice are critical of the agency's actions.
So far this year, 22,045 applicants have sought asylum in Sweden. About 4,000 of them have declared Serbian citizenship, compared with only 421 in same period last year.
In September alone, 1,410 Serbian citizens arrived in the country. Local authorities are currently arranging acute services such as health care.
Tjörn municipality on the west coast north of Gothenburg set up temporary accommodation for 200 asylum seekers overnight last week at tourist area Tjörnbro Park. The day after the first call from the agency, 100 to 150 asylum seekers arrived.
""They called at 4.30pm in the afternoon on Tuesday and the next day, on Wednesday, the first of them arrived,"" municipal executive board chairman Martin Johansen told news agency TT.
He is very critical of how the small municipality of 15,000 residents did not know anything before then from the agency.
""They must have known earlier when the agreement and negotiation were under way. We understand that they must have accommodation, but they put us in a very difficult situation. I think it is a matter of decency to get in touch so that the municipality gets a reasonable chance to prepare itself,"" said Johansen.
The spike in the number of asylum seekers from the western Balkans stems from the granting of visa-free access to the EU/Schengen Area to citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
With biometric passports, travellers from those countries can visit and stay in all EU countries for up to 90 days within a six-month period.
""It has resulted in an influx in 2010. You are not an asylum seeker until you apply for asylum,"" said Caroline Henjered, head of the division for asylum reception at the agency.
In addition, a similar flood from the western Balkans arrived in Sweden before becoming emergency asylum seekers."

The agreement covers asylum seekers who won't leave Sweden freely after their application for asylum has been rejected.
According to migration minister Tobias Billström, the clear time limit is a positive development.
The initial limit of two months can be extended to twelve months, however.
In addition, the agreement also calls for travel restrictions for those that do not follow the existing rules requiring those who are denied asylum leave the country within 2 to 4 weeks.
“If you don't leave the country, then you will be denied re-entry as a sanction. That means that you are not allowed to re-enter Sweden or the rest of the Schengen area,” Billström told the TT news agency.
The agreement also includes provisions to ensure that the needs of children are given special attention during and after the asylum process.
“The authorities should make sure to consider the perspective of the children involved when taking certain measures, and this could have certain consequences. For example, you have the possibility to weigh special circumstances,” said Billström.
The motivation for these changes is a new EU Return Directive which Sweden is obliged to implement. Now that the Green Party is in agreement, the bill will be sent on to the Legislative Council.
The Directive sets out common terms for member states in dealing with people residing in the EU without a permit.
Specifically the Directive grants more leeway with cases involving children, specifying that their interests should be taken into account. According to the Green Party this opens the door for more favorable treatment for families.
“During these negotiations, the Green Party sought a Swedish application of the Directive which is as humane as possible,” Maria Ferm, the Green Party's migration issues spokesperson, told TT.
The EU directive stipulates a travel ban of five years, but according to Maria Ferm the Green Party managed to lower the limit to one year for Sweden.
“We are against a re-entry ban, but it is something Sweden must introduce as a member of the EU. We have really pushed to make sure the time of the re-entry ban is as short as possible. It is positive that the suggested time, one year, is the shortest in the EU,” said Ferm.

A majority of the children come from Afghanistan and Somalia, according to the Migration Board.
Following a January ruling by the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrationsöverdomstolen) making it easier for families from Somalia to be reunited in Sweden, the number of asylum seekers from Somalia has risen by 58 percent to 2,507, making Somalis the largest group of asylum seekers in Sweden.
The second highest number of asylum seekers, 2,012, came from Afghanistan, an increase of 32 percent compared to the same period last year.

The number of immigrants coming to Sweden based on newly-established family ties fell by 800 to 12,707, while the number of immigrants seeking residence based on established ties dropped by 9 percent from 3,322 to 3,017.
Excluding seasonal berry pickers, the number of labour migrants from outside the EU/EES-area fell slightly with 6,215 people being granted work permits so far in 2012, compared to 6,734 in the first half of 2011.
Computer specialists are the the largest category of non-EU labour migrants, with 1,733 being granted temporary work permits in Sweden during the first six months of the year, an increase of 40 percent from last year.
The number of engineers and other technical specialists granted work permits has also increased, with most coming from India, China, and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the trend of fewer labour migrants working in the restaurant and service branch continued.
However, the number of berry pickers offered work permits in Sweden has increased dramatically, jumping from 494 during the first half of 2011 to 5,240 for the first six months of 2012.
According to the Migration Board, the rise can be explained to some extent by the fact that many applications were filed after July 1st last year.
Nevertheless, the number of berry pickers is expected to be substantially higher this year compared to 2011.

Asylum seekers and other foreigners are entitled to free SFI (Swedish for Immigrants) lessons under Swedish law.
But according to the Red Cross in Sweden, too many immigrants are facing a wait of “several years” before they are granted a place in class.
The charity says that asylum seekers in particular are facing long delays in securing the documents they need before they can start SFI lessons: a residency permit and proof of a permanent address in Sweden.
“Language is the key to getting into the Swedish society,” Ulrika Årehed Kågström, Secretary General of the Swedish Red Cross told broadcaster SVT on Tuesday.
Referring to the current waiting time for lessons for many immigrants, she added: “Resources are not sufficient and therefore the government needs to put more resources in order to make it work”.
Her comments followed a survey by the Red Cross and polling firm Novus which suggested that three out of four Swedes want asylum seekers to start learning Swedish as soon as they arrive in the Nordic nation.
The Red Cross is one of several charities in Sweden which offers separate language training for asylum seekers, but it is calling on the government to promote a greater compliance with the law to guarantee Swedish lessons for all new arrivals.
“As an asylum seeker you have to get started with the language immediately, and this is also how Swedish people seem to view it,” said Årehed Kågström.
Sweden takes in a bigger share of asylum seekers than any other EU member state, when compared to existing population size.
Around 9.6 million people live in the Nordic nation and asylum was granted to more than 33,000 refugees last year.
To cope with the increasing flow of refugees, the Swedish Migration Board announced in March that it has more than tripled the maximum number of residents allowed at each asylum centre in the nation from 200 to 650.
The country's open approach to immigration remains a hot topic, with centre-right opposition parties now mooting the idea of moving towards temporary residency permits rather than permanent asylum.
Sweden's anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats, secured almost 13 percent of the vote in last September's general election and is pushing for even tougher limits on immigration."

""We started from 5:00 pm to refrain from sending asylum seekers back to Greece,"" said Dan Eliasson, director general of the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket).
""The reasons are, firstly, that the situation in Greece is deteriorating constantly for asylum seekers,"" he said.
""Secondly, the European Court for Human Rights has asked member states to refrain from sending asylum seekers back to Greece.""
Under the European Union's much-criticised Dublin II regulation, illegal immigrants must be sent back to the country where they entered the EU.
About 75 percent of more than 40,000 people caught illegally entering the EU in the first half of this year did so through Greece.
Eliasson said the decision would affect about 100 people who would otherwise have been returned to Greece.
""We have not decided what to do with them,"" he said.
Sweden follows Norway and Austria in this decision.
On Tuesday, a force of 175 EU guards began arriving at the porous Greek-Turkish border, seen as the primary entry point for illegal immigrants into the EU.
Greece has sustained continued criticism in recent months over its treatment of new arrivals with a harsh regime and sub-standard housing in what critics have argued appeared a deliberate attempt to scare asylum seekers away from its shores."

Student activist Elin Ersson protested against the Swedish government’s policy of deporting some rejected asylum seekers to Afghanistan by boarding an Istanbul-bound flight that carried an Afghan man who was to be returned home after being denied asylum.
With a ticket for the flight that was purchased by the activist group 'Sittstrejken i Goteborg’, the activist boarded the plane and then refused to sit down until the Afghan man was let off. Flights are not allowed to take off until all passengers are safely in their seats.
Ersson livestreamed her protest on Facebook, where it has been viewed over five million times.
The reaction of her fellow passengers was mixed, with some confronting the student and telling her to sit down and stop filming and others expressing their support. Reaction on social media was similarly divided with many hailing the student a ""hero"" but others criticizing the method of protest.
Eventually, Ersson was told that the man would be let off the plane and she was also removed by airport security.
""All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal and I have not committed a crime,"" Ersson said in the video.
Shortly after the incident, a preliminary investigation was started to determine whether Ersson contention was correct. On Friday, prosecutors announced that they disagreed with the student activist’s stance on the legality of her actions.
“It is clear that when you look at this objectively, a crime was committed,” prosecutor James von Reis told SVT.
Although the SVT report did not indicate the specific violation of the Aviation Act, the law does refer to “disturbing the order or jeopardising flight safety or aviation security.”
Von Reis said that Ersson would soon be brought in for questioning and that he hopes to be able to formally prosecute the case in the near future.
“We will now hear what the suspect has to say and what sort of explanation the suspect has,” he said.
Violating the Aviation Act can result in fines or a maximum six-month imprisonment.
It is believed that the Afghan man who was due to be deported from Sweden via the Istanbul-bound flight out of Gothenburg was later deported from a different location.
In 2017, 9,062 rejected asylum seekers were ordered to leave the country by the Swedish Migration Agency, press officer Pierre Karatzian told The Local. At the time of Ersson’s protest, the figure for 2018 was at 4,292, although this may not reflect the exact number of deportations carried out, since deportations are carried out by the police and may change, for example if new information comes to light or it is not possible for them to return to their home country.
Activists have been campaigning against the Swedish Migration Agency's continued deportations of Afghan asylum seekers for months, including previous protests at the country's airports.
The Swedish Foreign Office's official travel advice to residents is to avoid all travel there ""due to the security situation"", but the Migration Agency maintains that parts of the country, including its capital Kabul, are safe enough for asylum seekers to be returned there."

The explanation for the cases not yet being processed is, according to the Migration Agency, that more staff members have left earlier than expected (numbers were boosted following the peak of the refugee crisis in 2015 then reduced again as the number of asylum seekers in Sweden dropped).
""That has led to reallocations of cases which meant a bigger amount of work per case,"" Migrationsverket told newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN).

Floating Accommodations claims that a sale may be necessary to cover losses they would incur if the Swedish migration agency (Migrationsverket) fails to pay a 54 million kronor ($6.44 million) bill the company has sent to the agency for the costs of running the ship.
The US-based shipping magnate sent out two invoices totalling the mammoth fee earlier in August, despite Migrationsverket insisting that their agreement to house asylum seekers on the vessel has been null and void since July.
And the 40,000 tonne Ocean Gala is now up for sale for a price of around $20 million.
“We've put the Ocean Gala up for sale because it appears that Migrationsverket will try to get out of our agreement. As contractors we have an obligation to try to limit the damage,” Floating Accommodations spokesperson Kjell Tandberg told local newspaper Sundvalls Tidning.
“If someone buys or charters it our demand to Migrationsverket will reduce, and if not, we will continue to demand payment for the whole year as if we were in operation,” he added.
The attempted sale is the latest twist in a long-winded dispute between the ship's owners and various Swedish entities, including the migration board and a local authority.
The affair started in February when Sweden signed a deal to lodge 1,800 asylum seekers aboard the ship, with its planned port of call Utansjö, in Härnösand on the Baltic Sea.
Härnösand municipality vetoed hosting the ship however. The Swedish migration board accepted that decision, before scrapping the deal with the firm entirely in July, arguing that the necessary requirements had not been met.
“Our deal was dependent on the procurement of all the necessary permits. This was not the case and the deal is therefore null and void,” Migrationsverket official Magnus Gustavsson said in a statement at the time.
Though Härnösand municipality banned the vessel from docking at Utansjö, the owners opted to lodge it there anyway. An appeal against that ban was subsequently thrown out by the Östersund regional Land and Environment Court at the start of August.
In a further act of defiance, Floating Accommodations has been billing Migrationsverket around 800,000 kronor per day since the start of July for the running costs of the ship.
But the immigration authority does not accept the validity of the invoices.
“Migrationsverket continues to deny Floating Accommodations' demand. Our position is and always has been that the agreement ended on July 3rd, 2016,” Migrationsverket press officer Petter Sundsten told newspaper Aftonbladet in response."

The questions were posed to asylum seekers who had converted to Christianity and were seeking asylum on the grounds of religious persecution.
Asylum seekers were quizzed on technical aspects of the Christian faith, such as the number of parts to the New Testament and the difference between the Orthodox and Protestant Churches.
Both lawyers and church representatives have criticized the practice, which they argue tests technical knowledge rather than a person's faith. The responses given to the questions could affect whether applicants are granted asylum or not.
""I think it's terrible. I have repeatedly had to interrupt administrators who ask these questions because they are not relevant and are far too complicated,"" lawyer Serpil Güngör told SVT.
Güngör said that he advises his clients to study the Bible carefully before their interview - while some Swedish parishes have begun preparing handbooks of facts aimed at asylum seekers in order to assist them.
However, the Migration Agency defended the nature of the interviews, and pointed out that they only form part of the overall assessment.
The agency also takes into account factors such as the applicant's explanation for why they converted to Christianity and how they exercise their faith.
""It is a reasonable demand that the asylum applicant should show some knowledge of the Bible - this should come naturally, and isn't something you need to study,"" Carl Bexelius, Deputy Legal Director at the Swedish Migration Agency, told SVT.

Ersson protested at Gothenburg's Landvetter airport with a group of around 25 other activists, part of the group 'Sittstrejken i Goteborg'. Then, she got on board the plane – the group had already raised money for her ticket – and refused to sit down until the man was let off.
The flight was scheduled to travel to Istanbul, from where the man was set to take another flight to Afghanistan.
""All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal and I have not committed a crime,"" said Ersson in the video, which has now been watched more than 2 million times on Facebook.
Ersson said the man would ""most likely get killed"" if forced to return to Afghanistan.
An employee could be heard telling her to sit down and stop filming, and another passenger challenged her and tried to take her phone away. However, others on board the flight supported the student activist, and the reaction on social media has been similarly mixed with many hailing the student a ""hero"" but others criticizing the method of protest.
Eventually, Ersson was told that the man would be let off the plane and she was also removed by airport security.
In a statement shared with The Local by Gudrun Romeborn from the protest group Sittstrejken i Goteborg, the group said: ""We would together like to bring forward the bigger picture, beyond this deportation [...] And what this story shows is that only one person is needed to spark action but many are needed to make a change.""
The group also confirmed that they had also originally intended to stop the deportation of a young man they heard was due to be deported to Afghanistan on the same flight, and protested by handing out information at the airport, contacting Turkish airports to try to get the flight cancelled, and offering emotional support to the man's friends and family.
However, the younger man was not on board Ersson's flight, and Romeborn said his family received a phone call from him in Kabul one day later, saying he ""had been put in a police car with shaded windows, driven to Stockholm, and put on a plane to Afghanistan"". When Ersson boarded the flight, she realized that only the older Afghan man was on the plane.
News of Ersson's protest has been shared worldwide, with coverage in dozens of different languages and praise from politicians and other rights groups.
On Monday evening Ersson said in a Facebook post that she would not be answering any more calls from journalists, adding: ""The deportation was stopped, I don't know anything more than that."" She did not respond to The Local's request for comment, but told the Guardian that she believes the man was deported from elsewhere in Sweden.
A police press spokesperson told The Local that such protests against deportations were uncommon in Sweden, and added that it would not normally be enough to stop the man's deportation.
""I can't comment on specific cases, but it would usually be postponed to be carried out at another date,"" she explained.

In April this year, a group of rejected asylum seekers including a majority of Afghans broke out of the detention facility where they were being held. This was the biggest such escape in several years.

Åsa Romson, the Green Party spokesperson, Mehmet Kaplan, party spokesperson for legal rights issues and Maria Ferm, spokesperson for migration policy, made the accusation in an opinion piece for the Aftonbladet newspaper.
The piece was published ahead of a weekend Green Party conference in Linköping, central Sweden, focusing on migration and legal rights.
""The reception of refugees is a national commitment according to international conventions"", the three politicians wrote.
""But while the Assad regime in Syria bombs its people and many are forced to flee the country, several Swedish municipalities are turning away unaccompanied refugee children.""

Sweden is currently accepting more refugees from Syria than any other European country.

The proposal comes from the Moderates' working group on social exclusion and segregation and is seen as a new way to push asylum seekers to live in places which provide better access to jobs and housing, writes the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper.
“Changes to the rules for welfare benefits will at this stage only affect asylum seekers. But in the future it may be appropriate to have the change cover job seekers who move where there are no jobs available,” said working group spokesman Ulf Kristersson to DN.
The question of whether asylum seekers should be free to choose where they live while their cases are heard, or whether they should be assigned to certain areas, has been under discussion for several years.
Some Moderate politicians from municipalities with high unemployment and many asylum seekers want to go a step further and jettison rules which allow asylum seekers to choose where they want to live.
Normally people move in with friends or relatives who are already living in Sweden.
Fredrick Federley of the Centre Party doubts whether the proposed change would have any effect.

But now Migration Minister Tobias Billström has said he will endeavour to ""fasttrack"" a new law that would enable the migration authorities to make exceptions to the law.
In an interview with Sveriges Radio, Billström said he expected the amended law to come into force in Spring 2010.
Previously, the minister had indicated that he would await the outcome of an official inquiry before giving his backing to a legislative amendment."

""I have not come across another case of a person being held in custody for so long,"" said Tobias Iwarsson, duty officer at Uppsala remand prison, to the newspaper.
Kadirou's eighteen months on remand has so far cost the penal system 1.2 million kronor ($ 161,000) and is considerably longer than average.
The 29-year-old, who claims to come from Algeria - a country he left as a 13-year-old, describes his situation as ""torture-like"".
""You can't imagine the nightmare in which I am living. Second after second locked up like an animal,"" Mehdi Kadirou told the newspaper.
Kadirou came to Sweden in 2007 and applied for asylum. The same year he stole a jacket from a store after threatening staff with a pair of scissors. He was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment and then deportation.
After serving his sentence for the robbery, Mehdi Kadirou's problems began.
The Algerian embassy in Stockholm declared itself unwilling to get involved in his case. He is unable to prove his identity as since fleeing the north African country he claims that he has lived on the streets and has never possessed any identity papers.
The Swedish police are working to determine his identity, a process which will be resumed in two months time and could in theory continually indefinitely, the newspaper writes.
According to Swedish law a person may not be held remanded in custody for a period longer than two months unless there are ""extreme circumstances"".
Tobias Iwarsson is critical that Mehdi Kadirou remains in his care pending the completion of the investigation.
""It would be one thing if he were violent, but this case concerns a diligent person,"" Iwarsson said.
Kadirou's legal counsel, Helena Jonsson, has submitted a request for her client to be transferred to one of the Migration Board's detention centres during the course of the police investigation but the application has been rejected.
A psychiatrist that has met Mehdi Kadirou in custody has concluded that the long periods of solitary confinement have caused the onset of depression and delusional behaviour.
The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture under the Council of Europe visited Sweden's prisons and remand prisons in 2009. The subsequent report noted that Sweden had on previous occasions been urged to desist from holding people for extended periods on remand."

This is a decline from the May estimate of 31,000 in Sweden this year and 28,000 next year. The primary reason behind the adjustment is that the number of applicants from Somalia is no longer increasing at the same pace as before, the agency wrote.
The change means that the agency will have better conditions to continue efforts to shorten the waiting times for applicants. The average processing time is currently four and a half months, the shortest in 20 years.
At the same time, the agency also lowered its forecast for unaccompanied children by 400 to 2,400. However, more are expected this year and the need for places remains high. At mid-year, over 450 children were still waiting to be received in a municipality.
The forecast for the number of cases relating to work permits has increased. The agency estimates that it needs a significant cash injection for next year, 312 million kronor ($42.68 million) more than the government's current proposals."

That coincides with the number of people seeking asylum in Sweden falling sharply compared to 2015.
Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum applications last year, but after the country's government subsequently tightened its policy in the area – including the introduction of photo ID border checks and temporary residence permits – the numbers applying dropped dramatically to around 19,270 in 2016.
At the same time, according to Swedish migration authority (Migrationsverket) statistics reported in newspaper Sydsvenskan, at least 10,665 people have voluntarily departed Sweden in the period between January and August 2016.
The figures include both people who withdrew their applications for asylum, and those who have been refused asylum.
Asylum seekers who choose to leave Sweden voluntarily can get their flight tickets paid for, and 30,000 kronor ($3,577) per adult in support money for reestablishment in their country of origin. The support money is capped at 75,000 kronor ($8,943) per family.
In an effort to reduce the numbers seeking asylum in Sweden, a new law was introduced on June 1st meaning that asylum seekers who have had their applications rejected lose their right to a daily allowance and housing.
Around 2,500 people have had their grants cancelled so far, but the number in that group who have left Sweden is in the region of one hundred.
“We suspected that not many in that group would travel themselves. These are people who have been in Sweden for a long time,” Sverker Spaak, head of Migrationsverket's repatriation department told Sydsvenskan.
“Their home countries often refuse to accept them and they are rejected by force, but we have made the judgment that they should be able to return voluntarily,” she added."

""I don't want to live here; I don't want to work here,"" she told The Local.
Ganna Dharmarajah, from Berkeley, California, came to Sweden in early April as a tourist under the visa waiver scheme, which permits US citizens to stay in Sweden for three months.
She was planning to leave Sweden in June, but since last month she has been registered by Swedish authorities as an asylum seeker.
Earlier this week, she was arrested and locked in a detention centre in Gävle.
Exactly why she became registered as an asylum seeker is unclear, but she maintains that she herself never sought refuge in Sweden. Her lawyer says she suspects the whole incident could be due to translation errors.
The episode started when she applied for an emergency loan via the US Embassy. When informed that it might take some time for a loan to be arranged, she says she was referred to Swedish social services. There, she was informed she was not entitled to Swedish state assistance.
Dharmarajah says she was collected from the social services office by police officers.
""The police took me to the police station, allowed me to call some of my friends in the US, and then took me to a refugee camp in Märsta,"" she tells The Local.
The police officers then took Dharmarajah's passport.
""They explained to me that I was an asylum case, and that asylum cases can't keep their passports.""
""It's crazy,"" she says. ""I never wanted asylum in this country. I don't want to live here; I don't want to work here.""
Dharmarajah initially remained free to come and go from the asylum centre, and after two days she left to visit a friend in Umeå. She says she would have liked to leave the country, but could not, as police refused to return her passport. Meanwhile, the US citizen contacted the US embassy and hired a Swedish lawyer to get her situation sorted out.
On Monday police arrested Dharmarajah on the orders of the Swedish Board of Migration, and took her to the asylum detention centre in Gävle.
Migration officials were giving few details of the case on Wednesday, saying only that Dharmarajah had applied to remain in Sweden and that her application had been refused.
""From June 1st we have had a request in to the police to make her leave Sweden,"" a spokeswoman told The Local. Ironically, such a process is likely to take some time, but Dharmarajah herself says if she was set free she would be on a plane to Japan on Saturday.
Dharmarajah's lawyer, Maria Guzman, received papers from the Swedish Board of Migration on Wednesday. She says that her client's version of events and those given by the board are entirely different.
""She says she only wanted to be in Sweden as a tourist; the Migration Board's understanding is that she has sought asylum.""
""I have no idea why their versions differ to such a great extent. It could possibly be down to a translation error, and I'm now trying to contact the interpreter from her original meeting with the migration board.""
Guzman says she will now try to help the American withdraw her asylum application. Meanwhile, an appeal to stop the deportation has been submitted.
The United States Embassy has also been in contact with Dharmarajah about her case, but was on Wednesday refusing to comment."

The images revealed a small hemorrhage in the man's brain and he was taken to Lund for surgery.
The 25-year-old was judged to be feeling well following the operation but when he was about to be sent home he lost consciousness and collapsed.
Diagnosed with a large cerebral hemorrhage, the man was taken in for emergency surgery but doctors were unable to save his life.

Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year. They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
READ ALSO: Sweden begins new asylum seeker age assessment tests
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was ""possibly 18 or over"".
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is ""possibly under 18"". The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
""We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent,"" he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age. In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that ""suggest the person examined is 18 years or older"".
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.

The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
""I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be. Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain. If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can,"" he told newspaper Metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however:
""In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small. The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent""."

According to a report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, some 84,200 people sought asylum in the EU during the first half of this year —a 21 percent drop from last years' numbers. In Sweden, 8,871 asylum seekers came to Sweden.
The Swedish Migration Board says the increased number in Sweden is a result of the country's law change which has made it easier for foreigners to gain residence permits.
“There are naturally exceptions, but conflicts mirror the stream of those seeking asylum,” said Lars-Gunnar Lundh, with the Migration Board, according to SVT, adding that most come from Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan.
Sweden has had trouble recently finding all of the asylum seekers homes because of its 2005 amnesty for asylum seekers.
Asylum seekers who were originally denied the right to stay in Sweden, but who ended up staying thanks to the amnesty, needed to be find somewhere to live. Many municipalities refused to take them in last month.
“We didn't know what to do with them,” said Sven-Ove Johansson, an expert on new arrivals with the Swedish Integration Board to The Local.
“It is a complicated system,” Johansson said. “The municipalities can say no to us, but they can't say no to an asylum seeker who shows up in their municipality and says, ‘Here I am.'”

“We are not encouraging them, but we are not discouraging them,” he said, adding that it is against the law for municipalities to turn people away.
He said Sweden has already given permits to 15,300 refugees this year who have found housing around the country.
He said if an asylum seeker is denied the right to remain but stays anyway, Sweden will eventually give him a permit rather than sending him back to a country where he might not be wanted.
“Their own countries, like Iran and Somalia, don't want them back, so here they are sitting in Sweden,” Johansson said. “Only about 20 percent have their applications accepted, but those who are denied because they have bad cases will probably get a permit if they don't want to leave.”"

Germany said on Wednesday it had postponed a scheduled deportation flight of rejected Afghan asylum seekers after a Kabul truck bomb attack killed 80 and wounded hundreds. The bombing killed an Afghan guard at the German embassy and wounded two embassy staff, one of them German, the other one Afghan.
""In the next few days, there will be no return trips to Afghanistan,"" said an interior ministry spokesman, insisting however that deportations would continue after that.
The bomb attack stirred further debate in Sweden a day after campaigners gathered outside a Migration Agency centre in southern Sweden to protest the deportation of around 20 Afghans, who were escorted by police to a chartered aircraft leaving for Kabul on Tuesday evening, newspaper DN reported.
While Sweden generally does not deport people to war-torn Syria, it makes a decision on each Afghan application on an individual basis. In December the Migration Agency noted that the security situation had deteriorated in the country, but insisted that some provinces were safer than others.
In 2015 23,000 unaccompanied minors from Afghanistan applied for asylum in Sweden.
Swedish campaigners for refugee rights have called on authorities to suspend all deportations to Afghanistan and all deportations of minors who came to Sweden without parents or guardians.
""Of course it is our view that deportations to Kabul should be stopped,"" Sanna Vestin, chairwoman of the Swedish Network of Refugee Support Groups, FARR, told The Local on Wednesday.
'Vi Står Inte Ut', a campaign group for the rights of refugee children, urged Sweden's foreign ministry and the Migration Agency to carry out a new evaluation of the security situation. ""We also urge Sweden's Social Democratic prime minister Stefan Löfven to support us in our fight for humanity and work to get Sweden to immediately stop forcibly deporting unaccompanied children and young people,"" it wrote in a statement.
""The government is of course concerned about recent security developments in Afghanistan,"" interior ministry spokesperson Sofie Rudh told The Local.
Asked if any discussions had been held at government level about following Germany's lead in temporarily suspending deportations, she said: ""The Swedish authorities responsible are the ones who determine this, through individual assessments in each case. The government may not interfere in that assessment.""
In a statement e-mailed to The Local and other media, Fredrik Beijer, head of the Migration Agency's legal department, said the agency was monitoring the situation in Afghanistan, but did not confirm any imminent policy changes.
""The situation in Afghanistan is serious and has deteriorated in the past year. The security situation however varies between and within different provinces. We note that there is an internal armed conflict in Kabul among other places, with repeated serious attacks. Many asylum seekers from Afghanistan may therefore stay in Sweden, but the situation is not such that everyone is entitled to protection. Each case is assessed on an individual basis. The Migration Agency continues to closely monitor the development in Afghanistan and makes decisions based on what is happening in the country.""
""There are reports that Germany authorities have cancelled a plane to Afghanistan following this morning's attack in Kabul. Of course, such an attack could mean that Swedish authorities also temporarily stop a return trip, linked to the fact that it would be practically difficult in such a situation,"" he said.
Last year the Migration Agency processed 12,168 Afghan asylum applications, 4,152 of which were rejected in the first instance."

It is more or less amnesty.”
He said if an asylum seeker is denied the right to remain but stays anyway, Sweden will eventually give him a permit rather than sending him back to a country where he might not be wanted.
“Their own countries, like Iran and Somalia, don't want them back, so here they are sitting in Sweden,” Johansson said. “Only about 20 percent have their applications accepted, but those who are denied because they have bad cases will probably get a permit if they don't want to leave.”
Staffanstorp municipality, in southern Sweden, doesn't have an agreement with the Swedish Migration Board this year, but the Board wants the authority to take in another 70 foreigners.

“There isn't even one house in the municipality and we already have long housing lines,” said Ingalill Hellberg, director of Staffanstorp, according to Dagens Nyheter. “That is why we said no.”
Johansson said the municipalities don't have a choice if a person wants to live there, adding that the Integration Board pays municipalities 165,000 kronor for each adult they take in.
He said studies in the past showed that the money given to the municipality is about 10 percent to 15 percent lower than what the local government needs to provide housing and education to the asylum seekers.
“It depends on how efficient a municipality is whether the fee we give them covers costs,” Johansson said.
He said Sweden should be able to find homes for all but about 3,000 of those now waiting. He said it would be up to politicians to figure out what they will do next year."

Both the police and residents have testified about a wave of fights at the facility and the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) has decided to close it, but currently has no alternative accommodation.
""We are in agreement with the municipality to close down the facility by the end of January. But today we do not have any other space. We have people living in the corridors and lying on mattresses in the reception accommodation,"" said Ulrik Åshuvud at the reception centre in nearby Västerås, underlining that Eskilstuna is a better alternative at the moment.

					15:51 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local/vt,Sweden to stop asylum expulsions to Greece,"Sweden's refusal of entry of asylum seekers from Greece violates the alien act, the country's migration court of appeal has ruled, ordering an end to Swedish expulsions and forcing the review of asylum applications in Sweden instead.
The UN has also noted the ""squalid overcrowded facilities"" and inhumane conditions for refugees in Greece.
As a result, the court has deemed the treatment of asylum seekers in Greece as unacceptable and has halted Sweden from sending back refugees who first set foot in the EU there.
The actual case facing the Swedish court concerns a family of three who will now have their asylum applications examined in Sweden instead. Since the court's decision is a precedent, it means that asylum seekers who find themselves in Sweden and have a transfer decision to Greece cannot be sent there.
""However, that does not mean they get a residence permit, only that it should be examined here in Sweden instead,"" Catharina Lindqvist, a judge at the court, told news agency TT.
Transferring asylum seekers to Greece is incompatible with the alien act and could constitute a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the court stated in a ruling on Friday.
According to the court, the conditions that asylum seekers in Greece face are unacceptable.
The court's criticisms did not mince words. In many cases, it was not even possible for asylum seekers in Greece to submit an application for asylum. If an asylum seeker succeeded in submitting an application, it was highly uncertain that the trial would be legally reliable.
""There is a great risk that their applications are not examined if they apply there,"" said Lindqvist.
The court also pointed out the grim conditions that are in place for those who come to Greece.
""We have established that the reception is very poor. They do not have housing or food and can be forced to live in parks. This results in a number of sanitary difficulties,"" said Lindqvist.
The asylum system and reception in Greece have further deteriorated as the country's debt crisis has become increasingly acute. The UN, the courts, humanitarian agencies have also slammed the reception the refugees receive in Greece.
""The asylum process as such in Greece does not live up to the standard that one is entitled to expect of a country that has an obligation to comply with EU regulations,"" the court said, calling the treatment ""inhumane.""
In October, UN special rapporteur Manfred Nowak called conditions for migrants in Greece too ""inhumane"" because of ""squalid overcrowded facilities,"" a poorly trained police force and a sharp increase in the number of migrants.
The European Commission has threatened several times to take Greece before the European Court of Human Rights. The court is currently reviewing several migration matters relating to Greece.
It is estimated that Greece faces about 50,000 untested asylum cases. Out of over 30,000 asylum applications in Greece last year, only 36 individuals were granted refugee status, while 128 had protected status.
In early November, the Swedish National Migration Board (Migrationverket) halted all transfers of asylum seekers to Greece under the Dublin Regulation with the expectation that the court would put its foot down.
Under the European Union's much-criticised Dublin II regulation, illegal immigrants must be sent back to the country where they entered the EU.
About 75 percent of more than 40,000 people caught illegally entering the EU in the first half of this year did so through Greece."

					14:44 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Fewer asylum seekers expected to arrive in Sweden over coming years: Migration Agency,"The Swedish Migration Agency has lowered its forecast both for the number of asylum seekers expected to arrive in Sweden, and the number of those expected to be returned to their home countries in 2017.
In 2017, a total of 23,000 people are expected to seek asylum in Sweden, followed by a further 24,000 in 2018.
The 2017 estimate represents a drop of 1,500 compared to July's estimate, while the figure for 2018 was revised down by 3,000. However, asylum seekers set to be relocated from Greece and Italy to Sweden in order to ease the strain on the Mediterranean nations were not included in the forecast.
The Migration Agency previously promised that a decision would be reached on the cases of all unaccompanied migrant minors who arrived between 2015 and 2016 by the end of this year, but at least 2,000 such cases are likely to be postponed to early 2018 due in part to age assessments taking longer than expected.
And while fewer asylum seekers are expected to arrive in Sweden over the coming years, the number of those expected to return home after being denied asylum was also revised down.
This year, the agency expects a total of 19,300 repatriation cases, a figure which is 3,200 lower than previously predicted.
Of those, 9,200 of the people involved are now predicted to return to their home countries voluntarily -- a decrease of 1,000 compared to the previous forecast made in July.
Meanwhile, the Migration Agency estimates that around 7,000 cases will be referred to the police because the people in question cannot be located.
Such cases occur when people stay illegally in Sweden, without a permit, or otherwise travel to another country, perhaps one where they have friends or family, without informing Swedish authorities.
Over the next three years, the Migration Agency estimated that this will happen in a total of 33,200 cases of people ordered to return to their home countries.
Other problems faced by authorities include cases in which the asylum seekers' home countries refuse to accept them, or if their identity cannot be confirmed.
In April, the Swedish government proposed new measures to try to improve the success rate in deportation cases, including giving police an increased ability to carry out inspections of workplaces.

					14:15 CET+01:00				", The Local,'Relocate Syrian refugees within Europe' says UN,"European countries should more evenly share the growing burden of new arrivals from Syria, the UN's Refugee Agency has told The Local as refugee numbers continue to swell in Sweden.
As the Syrian war enters its fifth year, the UN’s refugee agency is calling for a new approach in Europe to support some of the 3.9 million people who have fled the conflict.
Under the UNHCR’s new proposals, presented to the EU, some Syrians would helped to from their arrival points in southern Europe to elsewhere on the continent, in order to stop Mediterranean countries being overwhelmed by refugees and asylum seekers making illegal, often unsafe journeys to other parts of Europe, including Sweden and Germany.
“The situation in the Mediterranean is such that we think that it’s urgent to come with a fresh and bold look at what is happening, and to look at proposals to deal with this situation,” UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler told The Local Italy.
Last year over 170,000 people arrived by boat to Italy, with Syrians making up the largest group. UN figures however show that only a minority seek asylum within Italy, with most Syrians travelling across European borders illegally to settle elsewhere.
In Sweden, 50,235 people have sought asylum in the past three years. Sweden currently takes in more refugees per capita than any other European country and the Swedish government has pledged 1,200 resettlement places.
Recognizing this trend, Spindler said legal routes between southern and northern European countries must be opened up. The UN is calling for an agreement which would stop Syrians having to smuggle themselves across European borders, without altering the EU’s Dublin regulation on asylum seekers.
“We are not going as far as saying scrap Dublin or change the regulation, it was done for a reason. What we’re saying is let’s find a way of applying Dublin in such a way as it doesn’t cause this situation,” said Spindler.

The move follows similar calls from Swedish politicians including Liberal Party MEP Cecilia Wikström who last week wrote a debate article published on The Local Sweden.
""Five of the [EU] Member States receive 70 percent of the asylum seekers - Sweden, Germany, UK, Italy and France - while, for example, Estonia only received 10 people, Croatia 35 and Latvia 35 in 2013. It is time for a European quota system that distributes asylum seekers between Member States, based on population, GNP and other relevant factors,"" she said.
The UNHCR would not disclose the numbers of refugees included in its new proposal, referring only to a “more equitable distribution of refugees”, nor when an agreement could be reached. But with no sign of an end to the Syrian conflict, Spindler said the issue needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
“The attitude now is to shift the problem to somewhere else. We can’t continue doing this; we have to show more solidarity within Europe, and between Europe and other countries receiving most refugees,” he said.
In addition to the relocation scheme, the UNHCR is also pushing the EU to come up with a “much more robust search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean”. Italy last year ended its Mare Nostrum sea mission, which cost an estimated €9 million each month, replaced by the EU’s significantly smaller Triton operation.
“It’s unacceptable that thousands of people drown finding safety in Europe,” said Spindler, with hundreds of deaths already reported this year.
“Some countries - Greece, Bulgaria, Italy - are finding it really difficult to cope with this situation. Many of these asylum seekers continue their journey but still the cost of rescue is on a few countries,” he added.
The worsening security situation in Libya, from where the majority of migrants boats to Italy depart, has put even greater pressure on authorities in southern Europe.
The head of the EU’s border agency last week said that up to a million people were poised to flee Libya to Europe. ""In 2015 we must be prepared to face a much more difficult situation than last year,"" Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri said."

					07:41 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Donations up as asylum levels reach record,"UPDATED: More than ten thousand people applied for asylum in Sweden in August – the highest figure in a decade. Meanwhile, volunteer organizations are reporting being flooded with donations for refugees as heartbreaking pictures emerge from the growing crisis.
Sweden's Migration Board received a total of 11,743 applications for asylum last month, up from 6,619 in June and 8,066 in July, as an increasing number of refugees headed for the Nordic country over the summer.
“We would have to go back to the war in Bosnia in 1992-93 to find similar figures,” spokesman Anders Westerlund told the TT news agency on Thursday.
In its latest prognosis, the board estimated that around 74,000 asylum seekers would arrive in Sweden in 2015. The figure had then been cut from 90,000 suggested in February amid signs refugees had begun to shun the Nordic country as news spread about long processing times for applications.
But on Thursday Westerlund said that he believed the predicted number would be revised upwards again later this autumn.
“We have had an unexpected sharp flow from Turkey into Greece and then north through [the Former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonia and Serbia into Hungary. We had not forecast that level of increase,” he said.
“We are seeing rising numbers throughout Europe right now and it is then only natural that our own numbers increase.”
The news came as media around the world published a heartbreaking picture of a three-year-old Syrian boy lying face down, dead, on a beach after being washed ashore in Turkey brought the horror of the refugee crisis home to Europe.
""It is good that the picture is being shown, the world needs to see what is happening,"" Ali Al Refai, an asylum seeker from Syria who lives at a centre for refugees in Stockholm, told TT.

Sweden's open borders have been strongly criticized by opposition groups in recent months. The nationalist Sweden Democrat party, which supports slashing immigration, is growing in popularity, with polls suggesting last month that it is now supported by at least 18 percent of voters, in contrast to the 12.9 percent it polled a year ago in the last general election.
However, charity groups and local organizations also report noting an increased willingness to help from many Swedes. When Stockholm's city council this week put out a Facebook appeal for volunteers to support refugee children arriving in the capital calls flooded in.
“I've got more than 600 emails in my mailbox. The desire to contribute is amazing. We have to find a way to channel all this dedication now,” council officer Ulrika Hällgren told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper on Wednesday.

“One man from Syria said 'my country is shooting at me, but this restores my faith in humanity,” she told TT.
Meanwhile, donors for the Swedish branch of Save the Children ('Rädda Barnen') doubled in May to August from the same period last year. And a spokesperson for the Red Cross told TT she had also noticed an increased commitment to help.
“People get in touch all the time. (…) We also notice great dedication among immigrants to help new arrivals. That's an important turning point because it hasn't really been like that before,” she said.

The number of migrants reaching the EU's borders reached nearly 340,000 during the first seven months of the year, up from 123,500 during the same period in 2014, according to the bloc's border agency Frontex. A total of 48,774 have so far applied for asylum in Sweden this year.
But at least 2,300 migrants have died at sea since January during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers.
Europe's interior and justice ministers are set to meet in Brussels on September 14th to hammer out measures to cope with the escalating crisis.

					21:47 CEST+02:00				",Maddy Savage,'It was a long journey and some of my friends died',"A week after the Swedish Migration Board announced it was tripling the maximum number of residents allowed at asylum centres, The Local brings you a special report from inside Märsta, the country's busiest asylum application centre just outside Stockholm, where hundreds of refugees spend their first nights in Sweden each week.
Slumped on plastic chairs, some hugging battered suitcases, others appearing to have travelled without a single belonging, most of the latest asylum seekers to walk through the doors of the Märsta reception centre look visibly shattered. For many, the journey to Sweden has been a long and painful one.
""It was disgusting. I can't speak about it now. I don't want to remember [it],"" says Matios, 28, from Eritrea, who travelled to Italy by boat before making his way to Stockholm by train.
""It was hard for me. It was long journey and some of my friends died along the way, while they were with me,"" he adds, shuffling his feet and gazing at the floor.
He doesn't want to have his photo taken, but raises his eyes and speaks firmly when asked about why he is seeking a new home in the Nordic nation.
""There is unlimited military service in my country, that is the main problem. I chose Sweden because there are human rights in Sweden. You can speak freely about whatever you want"".
His words are echoed by Emad, a 22-year-old from Libya, sporting a hoodie and a lot of hair gel.
""Sweden has the top reputation, everyone is talking about Sweden,"" he says.
His boat from Benghazi docked in Malta before he flew with Ryanair to Copenhagen and then caught the train to Stockholm.
""I came here because I have a problem in my country...everyone is killing each other,"" he explains in a mixture of Arabic and English.
""I hope to stay here and relax...I hope to also find work, to buy a car and make a future here. I will do any kind of job. If I find work, I will do it.""

Märsta is the first port of call for hundreds of refugees arriving in Sweden every week. The bland, red brick building complex currently houses up to 150 people each night, in single sex dormitories or family rooms. Anyone seeking asylum and without an address in Sweden is entitled to seek temporary emergency accommodation for up to three nights while they wait for their initial application to be processed. The centre is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
""The rooms are just very basic but we do have cleaners every day,"" says team leader Anna Andersson as she opens the door to a huge storage room piled high with sky blue plastic zip-up laundry bags.
""These are the welcome packs we give everyone. There's a pillow, blankets, a towel, a toothbrush, a toothpaste and toilet paper. And you can take this with you when you go.""
""We try to make people comfortable. There is also common area for watching TV and relaxing. We have a kids area here, although now it is in need of repainting,"" she adds, pointing to an empty cluster of child-sized tables and chairs and a wall covered in scribbles.
""We did have lots of toys donated at Christmas time, but they moved on with the visitors.""

Sweden is seeing its asylum requests rise to record levels, with about 90,000 applications anticipated by the end of 2015. Numbers have been steadily rising since the Nordic nation became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees, but it has also accepted thousands of others from nations including Eritrea, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans as well as a growing influx from Somalia.
To cope with the increasing flow of refugees, the Swedish Migration Board announced this week that it had more than tripled the maximum number of residents allowed at asylum centres from 200 to 650. The government says it wants to continue providing security for refugees, but has called on other EU member states to share the burden. Currently only Germany processes more asylum applications.
While the majority of Swedes support their country's open door policy, it has been linked to rising support for the nationalist Sweden Democrat party (now the third largest political group in Sweden), and growing numbers from across the political spectrum say they are concerned about how the government is tackling integration.
In the short term, pressure is also mounting on staff at immigration centres such as Märsta, who are facing an increasingly heavy workload.
""Sure, of course we have felt that it has been growing and that more people are coming,"" says Andersson, appearing to choose her words carefully.
""It's been more necessary to plan better to make sure that we have beds for the night. But I would say we have coped well,"" she adds, explaining that staff work hard to avoid the ""nightmare"" of having to turn people away.
""A bed is what I would want after travelling far and being tired and arriving somewhere. I mean a bed...it's only a bed, it's not the end of the world,"" she says, keen to stress that her role fits into a much bigger jigsaw puzzle.

Immigration officials at Märsta conduct interviews with each new asylum seeker and take fingerprints to check that they have not already been registered elsewhere in the EU. Those who have could be sent back, because of EU laws stating that all migrants should have their claims processed in the member state in which they first arrive. Those judged to be genuine applicants are transferred on to a second processing centre in Gävle, a ninety minute drive north. They spend several more days there while their paperwork is dealt with before being sent to more permanent housing elsewhere in Sweden. The country aims to consider all asylum requests within three months, although for some it can take considerably longer.
""I have high hopes for my future here. This is where I want to be. I am very relieved that I made it,"" says Refaat Sharrook, a Syrian dressed in a smart suit for his first meeting with Swedish officials.
""I praise God that I have made it to this land that I have heard so many positive stories about,"" he adds in Arabic.
The 37-year-old plans to meet up with other business contacts from his homeland who have already been granted asylum.
""I used to work in the car industry and I have connections here,"" he smiles, clutching his mobile phone and a pile of documents.

But his glaring optimism is juxtaposed with the grief of a young Nigerian family staying in a room across the corridor. They have spent the past year seeking asylum in Sweden and have returned to Märsta in a desperate bid to have their case reviewed, after being told to fly home or return to France, the first EU country they landed in.
""We have met a lot of people who have told lies and thrown their passports away in order to help with their asylum applications,"" says Lloyd Justus, 35, gripping the hand of his wife Princess, 20.
""As practising Christians that [idea] was very difficult for us...but maybe we were the stupid ones,"" he sighs as their seven-month-old baby starts crying.
The couple, who lived in Libya until 2012, say they have no relatives left in Africa and are scared that their home country is becoming more and more violent. But unlike Syria, Nigeria is not considered a war zone by the EU, and its people are not automatically granted asylum in Sweden.

The pair tell a complex and sometimes confusing story about being shunted between different housing projects and separated following the birth of their child after falling out with one another as well as the Swedish authorities. While Princess was given a room in a Swedish woman's home by Social Services, Lloyd says he spent several months sleeping rough and in African churches, surviving by picking cans off the streets and swapping them for food bags handed out by various charities.
""After all this we have been told we have to go back to France. The thing is we didn't understand the visas when we got them, we were just looking for a better life. In Nigeria its a very corrupt place - you buy a visa to get you to Europe for 10,000 US dollars. You don't have a choice for Italy, Greece, Sweden. It's not like that in Africa, whatever you are offered, you take"".
With tears in his eyes he adds: ""I have thought many times about committing suicide. The only reason I didn't commit suicide is because if I kill myself Jesus is not going to accept me into heaven, I am going to go to hell.""
Sweden's Migration Board cannot shed any light on the couple's prospects. The authority does not discuss individual immigration cases with the media.
But as yet another handful of immigrants shuffle through the immigration centre's doors while the sun goes down, it is clear that whatever happens to Märsta's current crop of arrivals, officials are set to have their work cut out for the foreseeable future.

""When we smoke... we're calm and don't worry about anything,"" says Mahdi, a 16-year-old Afghan refugee, who started using heroin after he arrived and quickly got hooked.
Uppsala, a university town an hour's drive north of Stockholm, has taken in nearly 1,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers under the age of 18.
Around 100 of them, most of them Afghan, have been caught using heroin as they wait for their applications to be processed, which can take more than a year on average.
Swedish authorities acknowledge that drug abuse is prevalent among young asylum seekers.
In the capital Stockholm, at least 1,000 young asylum seekers received treatment for drug abuse in 2016. Most of them were minors and boys, health authorities said, without specifying their country of origin.
Anders Nilsson is a 38-year-old anti-narcotics police chief who's trying to do something about it.
Wearing faded jeans and a baseball cap, Nilsson leads a team of undercover cops scouting for young heroin addicts in the streets of Uppsala.
Strolling on a busy shopping street, he approaches groups of boys to see if anyone could be under the influence of heroin, eyeing their pupils and checking their pockets.
Authorities want to take action to ensure the young men don't become a threat to themselves or to society.
""It's tough to find yourself in an asylum application process and having to wait for a decision,"" Hilde Wiberg, head of social services in Uppsala, says, adding many asylum seekers feel mentally unstable because of past traumas.

Mahdi is one of the lucky ones: he overcame his heroin addiction and received permanent residency in Sweden.
Covering his head with a blue hoodie, he said he and his friends smoked the highly-addictive drug, related to opium which Afghanistan produces and distributes around the world, to ease their fear of being deported.
""(If) they don't have permanent residency... they're forced to go back to Afghanistan,"" Mahdi tells AFP.
And going home means they're at risk of being killed by either the Taliban or the Islamic State group.
Afghans constitute the highest number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Sweden. Nearly 80 percent of them have their applications approved.
Of the 1,321 requests processed so far this year, 200 have been rejected, according to the Swedish Migration Agency.
But in a revised security assessment published in December, the agency deemed some regions in Afghanistan such as Panjshir, Bamiyan and Daikundi ""less dangerous"" despite ""increasing violence"" in the war-torn country, making it easier to deport rejected asylum seekers to those areas.
Daniel Larsson, an Uppsala police superintendent, said a case of occasional possession or use of heroin would not negatively affect an individual's asylum request.
However, criminal acts would.
In order to fund their expensive habit, these young men often turn to a life of crime.
Police say they enter luxury clothing boutiques in central Uppsala and snatch whatever they see. Passersby have also been robbed, according to local media reports.
They then take the train or bus to northern Stockholm to buy the drugs, returning to Uppsala after making their purchase.
If the asylum seekers are caught using heroin by the undercover cops, they're taken to the police station for a urine test and kept under the supervision of social services.
But they won't face jail time.
Anders Nilsson says there's no other alternative for heroin abusers than to receive care.
""Instead of sentencing them to prison... we have the possibility to sentence them to (health) care,"" Nilsson says.
Asylum seekers whose addiction has gone too far are committed to care homes across Sweden. But Nilsson fears those homes are already overcrowded.
""It's very difficult to find space... you need a specific type of care.""

The facility opening up at the Gothenburg prison, which is expected to have space for seven people, was touted as an improvement by prison officials.
But the Migration Board's decision to hand responsibility for rejected asylum seekers to the Swedish prison system doesn't sit well with officials at human rights group Amnesty.

					22:14 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Asylum seekers in Kiruna suicide threat,"A couple from Turkey seeking asylum in Sweden threatened to set themselves on fire in the Board of Migration's offices in Kiruna on Monday.
After hours of negotiations the pair eventually left the building at around 10pm.
""It was completely undramatic. They came out calmly and have now been taken to a doctor,"" said Kiruna police spokesman Lage Wuotilainen.
The couple were said to be in their thirties. Their two children, a boy and a girl, were released just before 6pm after drawn-out negotiations with officers.
The incident began at just before 11am on Monday, when police were informed that the man had poured gasoline over himself and was prepared to set himself on fire.
According to the migration board's press office in Norrköping the family had had their application for a residence permit rejected.
""I don't know what kind of permit they had applied for, just that it is a man with a wife and two children,"" said Louise Utter at the Board of Migration press office.
Police said that only the man had poured petrol over himself, but his wife remained with him throughout. The police's first step was to secure the safety of the children.
""We got the parents to let the children go. They will undergo a medical examination and then be transferred to social services,"" said Wuotilainen.
He said that he did not know how old the children were but described them as 'small'.
The building, which the Board of Migration shares with the tax board and the police, was evacuated earlier in the day."

					10:20 CET+01:00				",AFP,Danish police arrest Sweden-based Syrian over planned 'terrorist' attack,"Danish police on Friday said they had arrested a Syrian asylum seeker from Sweden for ""attempting to commit a terrorist act"" in Copenhagen.
The Copenhagen police said they arrested the 30-year-old man jointly with the Danish Security and Intelligence Service on Thursday over a failed attack which he plotted with another 21-year-old man in November 2016.
“The man is charged with attempted terrorism for having, together with another man convicted in Germany, planned to randomly kill or hurt several people in an unknown location in Copenhagen,"" the police said in a statement.
The police added the two men ""wanted to attack people with knives and thereafter detonate one or several explosives, which failed when the accomplice was denied entry into Denmark and arrested by the German police"".
A German court in July convicted the 21-year-old, described as a Syrian refugee by the German media, for attempting an attack. He was reportedly carrying 17,000 matches, two kitchen knives and six walkie-talkies when the German police arrested him.
Earlier this year a would-be female jihadist was sentenced to eight years in jail for a planning to bomb two Danish schools. The Islamic State sympathiser, a Muslim convert, was just 15 years-old when she was arrested in 2016.

					09:00 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden could call in police to evict failed asylum seekers,"Sweden’s migration authority (Migrationsverket) could be given the power to call in police to evict failed asylum seekers no longer entitled to use their accommodation, following a new government proposal.
An amendment made to Swedish asylum laws on June 1st means that adults without children who have received a final rejection on their asylum application are no longer entitled to accommodation or a daily allowance from the country’s migration authority.
And now, the Swedish government wants to introduce a further amendment, after the migration board pointed out that it needs to ensure those who no longer have the right to remain in their facilities leave, so that new asylum seekers can take their place.
Evictions from Migrationsverket’s accommodation are currently handled by the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Kronofogden) – a government agency more commonly tasked with sending bailiffs to deal with debt cases.
And according to the migration board, the situation is far from ideal.
“Today around 2500 people have received a decision saying they will lose their right to assistance,” Migrationsverket press officer Helena Cho Györki told news agency TT.
“We know that around 1000 have left their accommodation, around 800 are still living there after losing their assistance, and that with around half of these we have already requested help from the Enforcement Authority.”
The new draft legislation allowing police to handle evictions would enter into force on January 1st. It is currently being studied by Sweden’s Council on Legislation (Lagrådet), which advises on the legality of government proposals."

					15:52 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,How Sweden wants to return rejected asylum seekers,"Swedish police could be allowed to raid workplaces to track down people who have had their asylum request rejected, as the government tries to make it easier to deport rejected asylum seekers.
Interior Minister Anders Ygeman and Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson presented the proposed measures at a press conference in Stockholm on Thursday.
""Anyone who hasn't had their application approved has to go home, that's the basic principle,"" said Johansson about the efforts to reduce the number of asylum seekers remaining in Sweden after getting their applications rejected.
The government wants to give police the power to carry out checks at workplaces across Sweden to track down rejected immigrants working illegally. As the law currently stands, authorities have to formally suspect that a crime has been committed to get permission for such raids.
Other proposed measures include making it easier for police to seize passports and ID documents and taking fingerprints of people suspected of being in Sweden without permission.
The government also wants to review the age limit, which currently stands at 14, of people who have to have their fingerprints taken when applying for asylum. The ministers did not propose a new limit on Thursday, but noted that the EU Commission suggests six years.

The number of people leaving Sweden voluntarily is increasing, but almost 20,000 people are currently believed to be staying in the Nordic country despite having had their residency applications rejected, reports the TT news agency. More than 12,000 are wanted by police, reports public broadcaster SVT.
In some cases, failed asylum seekers go underground. In other cases, Sweden is struggling to deport them because their identity has not been confirmed or because their home countries do not want to accept them.
Sweden took in an unprecedented 163,000 asylum seekers last year. In its latest forecast from this summer, the Migration Agency estimates that around 28,400 people will have their applications rejected this year, followed by 33,200 next year and 34,800 in 2018."

					15:42 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Supermarket rescues asylum seekers,"New security rules have led to asylum seekers being shut out by state-owned Svensk Kassaservice, forcing them instead to turn to the bank owned by the Ica supermarket chain as the only way of receiving benefits to which they are entitled.
Asylum seekers aren't granted Swedish personal numbers, thus making it nearly impossible for them to open bank accounts with the banks. They, along with thousands of other immigrants, also lack the opportunities to get themselves Swedish IDs which would grant them to access bank accounts, including accounts with state-owned counter service provider Svensk Kassaservice.
Until Svensk Kassaservice changed its policy on 1st January, asylum seekers received their benefits paid out to accounts at Svensk Kassaservice. Because of the general tightening of policy to recognize applicants for accounts or for applicants to obtain a Swedish ID, the Swedish Migration Board was forced to find a solution elsewhere for asylum seekers.
Asylum seekers who require financial support are paid out a maximum of 71 kronor per day if they are on their own, or 61 kronor per day as part of a couple. There is additional money paid for children as needed. There are other payouts of benefits for asylum seekers as the need arises. All of this money needs a way to be distributed.
The Migration Board rejected the option to store and pay out cash, citing security reasons. They looked at various alternatives, but found that the major banks were unwilling to provide a solution. Ica and its Ica bank AB came to the rescue.
Marie Andersson at the Migration Board told the Local that they are relatively satisfied with this as an interim solution. However, it comes at a price. “It is not ideal. It's quite expensive.”
It's estimated that the cost to the Swedish taxpayer is seven million kronor per year to distribute an annual pay out of approximately 70 million kronor. The Migration Board's agreement with Ica will expire in March 2008 when they will take in new bids from the various banking and financing institutions.

					18:49 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Asylum seekers 'should move where the jobs are',"Asylum seekers in Sweden could soon face new measures to stop them moving to areas which already have large numbers of refugees, after the government announced on Tuesday an inquiry into the issue.
Migration Minister Tobias Billström said on Tuesday that people claiming asylum in Sweden will have to live where the jobs are.
Municipalities including Gothenburg, Malmö and Södertälje have long complained over asylum seekers' right to live where they want. They say that immigrants gravitate to areas where their compatriots are concentrated, straining local infrastructure.
Billström said that he would be preparing instructions for the inquiry ""in the near future"":
""The most important thing is to link employment with where people live. We want to encourage people to live in parts of the country where there are both jobs and homes,"" he said. But Billström said he was not in favour of a legal bar on asylum seekers living where they want.
New statistics produced by news agency TT show that more than half of those applying for asylum in Sweden this year will be allowed to stay. This compares to just 13 percent in the two years prior to introduction of the 2005 Aliens Act.
These extra migrants, together with people moving to Sweden on the basis of a family connection and so-called quota refugees, mean that at least 30,000 people will need places on locally-run courses providing introductions to Swedish society.
Tobias Billström said it was important to note that ""the international situation is a fundamental factor"" in the rising number of asylum seekers.
""[Education minister] Jan Björklund knows exactly how many third graders are starting in the autumn, but I don't really have that luxury,"" he added."

					08:44 CET+01:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden's housing obligation to asylum seekers means other vulnerable groups go without: report ,"A new report by Sweden's county administrative boards warns that vulnerable groups are struggling to find housing because homes are being allocated to asylum seekers. But the country's housing minister insists that the real problem is municipalities not building enough.
In the report, which broadcaster SVT had access to, around 60 percent of Swedish municipalities said they had experienced a 'displacement effect' – where other vulnerable groups had a difficult time finding a home because of the right to housing for asylum seekers.
""As a consequence, others who need housing go without. We are not obliged to supply housing for them,"" Thed Carlsson, head of social services in Hässleholm municipality, told SVT.
According to him the groups impacted are students, young people, and also people who have had to stay longer at treatment homes and institutions because there is no housing available.
The situation may get worse, as Sweden's municipalities and county councils estimate housing will need to be provided for around 100,000 people with residence permits over the next year.
Housing minister Peter Eriksson insists however that municipalities are attempting to shift the blame away from themselves.
""It's an incorrect description. Municipalities have a housing security responsibility to ensure that everyone has a home. Most are attended to in the right way,"" he told news agency TT.
According to him there is a problem with some municipalities and public housing companies not building to a degree that would provide an excess of housing for the coming years:
""The housing shortage cannot be solved with a quick fix. It will take time to resolve the shortage that has been building up for 20 years"".
