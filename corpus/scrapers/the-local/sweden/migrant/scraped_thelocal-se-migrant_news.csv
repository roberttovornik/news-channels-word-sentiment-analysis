					15:52 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Jönköping teen arrested for murder of EU migrant,"A teenaged boy was arrested on Monday on suspicion of murdering an EU migrant earlier this month in the Jönköping area, radio station P4 Jönköping reported on Monday.
The male migrant was found dead in a local park earlier this month but it took police a week to determine that a murder had occurred. The police investigation then led to the teenager who was arrested on Monday.
The migrant’s death led to a number of rumours amongst the local youth and numerous video clips of the victim were posted to social media. The migrant, who was in his 50s, reportedly lived in the Huskvarna park where he was found dead.
Police have been in contact with two other boys in connection with the crime. Both are under the age of 15 and one is as young as 13 according to P4 Jönköping. One of the boys is suspected of assaulting the migrant on the same day as the alleged murder while the other is suspected of harassing the victim.
The teenage murder suspect has been assigned a public defender.
Linda Schön of the Prosecution Authority (Åklagarmyndigheten) did not wish to release details of the ongoing investigation.
“In order to ensure that the preliminary investigation can be carried out legally and effectively, we wish to work undisturbed,” she said via a press release."

					10:57 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Sweden learns of new EU migrant quota details,"Sweden has been told to help relocate 821 migrants who have arrived in Italy and 548 who have travelled to Greece as part of the European Commission's controversial plans to ensure refugees are spread more evenly across member states.
EU's executive body's plans also include proposals to beef up European border controls, including a military action plan to stop people smugglers and improving ways for qualified immigrant workers to get jobs.
The new mandatory quota system is designed to see most EU member states allocated a set number of asylum seekers based on their population size, economic growth and former engagement with asylum seekers.
It is intended to apply to Syrians and Eritreans who arrived in Italy after April 15th and are deemed to be in need of protection. A further 16,000 migrants who arrived in Greece from the two countries should also be relocated, the EU said.
If the scheme is successful, the 40,000 chosen refugees will over the next two years be relocated to 23 countries named by Brussels and member states will be given €6,000 (55,580 kronor, $6,525) for each person they take in.
Sweden -- which already takes in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation -- has been asked to welcome 821 new migrants from Italy, 3.4 percent of the total, alongside 548 from Greece.
Most EU member states will be legally required to implement the quotas, although they still need to be approved by national ministerial representatives from each country.
The UK is notably absent from the measure, following the British government's vocal opposition to plans to relocate refugees.
This is because -- along with Ireland -- it has a long-standing 'opt-in' right on some EU legislation, which means it is not obliged to participate. Denmark has a similar 'opt-out' right and will also not take part in the quota scheme.
The UK is however included in an additional EU measure to resettle 20,000 refugees from outside Europe, part of a scheme aimed at stopping people taking the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean in order to seek asylum. Sweden has been asked to help 491 people as part of the same measure.
The High Representative for the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, said: ""Two weeks after adopting our Agenda, we present today concrete proposals for its implementation, with one main aim: quickly save lives and provide protection in the EU for people in need, be they at sea, in the EU or in third countries.""
""For this reason, we are intensifying our cooperation with countries of origin and transit and with countries hosting refugees, not only to support asylum and migration capacities, but also to tackle the root causes that force people to escape and migrate: poverty, wars, persecutions, violations of human rights and natural disasters.""
Sweden is one of the most vocal supporters of the new quotas, which are also strongly backed by Germany.
“Our Common European Asylum System is not very common in a situation where a handful of member states are taking the responsibility for over 90 percent of the asylum seekers,” Sweden's justice and migration minister, Morgan Johansson, told The Local last week.
“For the Common European Asylum System to be sustainable in the long run, a more even distribution of asylum seekers within the EU is needed.”
It is estimated that more than 1,800 migrants have died so far in 2015 while making their way to Europe from war-torn nations such as Syria, Iraq and Libya, in packed boats travelling in dangerous conditions.
Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallström, recently told The Local that she predicted the Commission's proposals were likely to be “controversial”, but added: “What if we lived in a war zone? We would also want to flee somewhere safe with our children, or try to secure a future elsewhere. It has to do with whether or not we are serious in the EU about our guiding principles – this will affect our credibility.”"

But coalition government partners the Greens disagree.
In 2016 around 3,900 work permits were granted in Sweden for jobs which required no more than a short induction or period of training. A large proportion was in low-skilled agricultural work like berry-picking.
Backed by LO, the Social Democrat leadership now plans on proposing restrictions in the area at its next party conference.
""There are unemployed people in our country who could take these jobs, which don't require higher education or high levels of qualification. It is reasonable that they should get these jobs first,"" Social Democrat PM Stefan Löfven told Swedish news agency TT.
Sweden's current rules for migrant labour were put in place by the previous centre-right Alliance government, and were backed at the time by the Greens, who are now in coalition government with the Social Democrats.
That didn’t help the Green Party's popularity with the blue collar LO unions, but the party does not plan on changing its stance on the matter, regardless of what its Social Democrat partners think.
""No, we have the same position as before. We think that today's rules are valuable and we are of course working in different ways to improve them, prevent people being exploited and improve processing times,"" Green spokesperson Maria Ferm told news agency TT.
PM Löfven insists his party is not trying to appeal to the voters lost to populists with the proposal, and argues that those who are unemployed in Sweden should be prepared to take the available jobs regardless of whether they prefer them or not.
""If you're unemployed in Sweden you must also be ready to take the jobs that there are, that's the rules we have,"" he said.
The centre-right opposition Moderates have questioned how effective limiting foreign workers would be in that regard however.
""The problem isn't that too many people are coming here and picking berries. The big problem is that far too few people who live here are taking the jobs that there are, like for example, picking berries,"" Moderate labour policy spokesperson Elisabeth Svantesson said.
Social Democrat members will decide whether to back the proposal or not at the party's next conference in Gothenburg this April."

					12:47 CET+01:00				",TT/Rebecca Martin,Migrant workers on the rise in Sweden,"The number of people coming to Sweden to work is rising at the same time as the number of refugees coming to the country is falling, according to new figures from Statistics Sweden (Statistiska Centralbyrån, SCB).
The figures show that immigrants coming to Sweden to work has doubled since 2004, to 8,667 in 2010.
This includes those that have become registrered residents in Sweden and have stayed in Sweden for at least a year.
The trend is even more visible looking at the numbers from the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket).
Since the new law came into effect, the agency has granted about 40,000 work permits to non-EU residents, although these figures only show how many permits were granted, not how many immigrants actually arrived in Sweden.
According to former minister for migration, Social Democrat Jan O. Karlsson, immmigration policy in Sweden was long goverened by the country's wish to feel benevolent.
”Only those we pitied were allowed in. It is very much a colonial way of thinking. New and modern immigration policy builds more on a global and reciprocal dependence,” he told daily Dagens Nyheter (DN).
Karlsson is referring to changes to the law on labour migration from 2008, which could be argued to be one of the most generous policies when it comes to granting work permits to residents from outside the EU.
The change to the law meant that a the Swedish National Employment Office (Arbetsförmedlingen) no longer needed to prove there was a need on the Swedish labour force before a non-EU worker could be recruited for a position in Sweden.
Following the change, individual employers are granted the power to determine their staffing needs and meaning that an offer of employment from a Swedish employer can be enough for a non-EU worker to be granted a Swedish work permit.
The permits are limited to time, but can become permanent after four years.
One of the staunchest opposers to the change, the chair of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen, LO), Wanja Lundby Wedin, thinks that the need for workers should be still be determined by the employment agency before non-EU residents are recruited.
”Unemployment within the EU is enormous. The employers' motives in bringing people in from countries outside of the EU, to clean or to work in restaurants, is to get a labour force who will agree to work under terrible condidtions,” she told DN.
However, current minister for migration, Tobias Billström, points out that many areas have had problems with illegal workers for a number of years.
”This law makes it possible for people who want to work to do so legally. Those that are in Sweden under false pretenses can never argue their cause. Someone with a work permit can get help from their union,” he said to the paper.
Nevertheless, the Swedish Migration Board has called for rules governing the granting of work permits to be strengthened to help prevent migrant workers from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers.
From mid-January, companies need to be able to show that salaries, insurance and employers' fees have been met and that employers have been infomed of working conditions.
In addition, staffing companies based in countries outside the EU will be required to have a registered subsidiary in Sweden."

Italian coastguard ship Diciotti arrived at Sicily late on Monday night after picking up 177 people near the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, including an estimated 30 unaccompanied minors.
The vessel was allowed to dock, but the migrants have been denied permission to disembark.
The country’s hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has threatened to take them to Libya unless other EU countries take them in, despite reports of serious abuse in North African detention camps.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven on Wednesday confirmed reports by Swedish public radio that his centre-left coalition government had declined requests to let the migrants on board seek asylum in Sweden.
""Other countries have to step up and show that they want to take responsibility,"" he told newswire TT.
He said Sweden, which received around 163,000 asylum requests in 2015, took on a ""huge responsibility"" at the time but has since tightened its migration policies. By the end of 2018, the Migration Agency expects 23,000 people to have applied for asylum in the Nordic country this year.

According to the latest figures from the UNHCR, the crossing from North Africa to southern Italy is becoming more deadly: more than 1,500 people died making the journey between January and July, or one in every 17 who tried. The death rate tripled this year compared to the same period in 2017."

The Dagens Nyheter newspaper recently revealed that the police have designated a special code, R291, for incidents involving asylum seekers and refugees, allowing them to keep tabs on how last autumn’s record influx of asylum seekers into the country has affected their work.
According to SvD's collation of all R291 cases, police have been called out to no fewer than 559 registered assaults, 450 fights, 194 cases of violent threats, 58 fires, two bomb threats, nine robberies and four rapes, all involving recently arrived asylum seekers.
“The unrest in asylum accommodation is something that requires more and more of us,” Sweden’s police commissioner Dan Eliasson told SvD after the figures were released. “I am concerned about these developments. I fear that there may be even more trouble, I think the trend points in that direction. If we analyze this carefully, there is an increasing problem.”
As well as the violent crimes, there were 37 cases of attempted suicide, 42 cases of people reported as “mentally ill”, 96 missing persons, and three deaths.
Eliasson said the pressure on the Swedish authorities, and the experiences of newly arrived migrants was a recipe for unrest.
“There is a difficult accommodation situation for many people, it’s crowded, some people bring with them the baggage of traumatic events. There can be various disagreements between the groups.”
The the Swedish police’s National Operations Department (NOA) introduced the code in October at the peak of Sweden’s refugee crisis when as many as 10,000 new asylum seekers were registering in the country every week.
At the time police saw a surge in the number of call-outs to crimes of violence, arson and intimidation at asylum centres.
The code coveres all cases “involving migrant situation”, including cases where asylum seekers are victims or perpetrators of crimes."

Officers rounded up 14 people on Monday night in cars close to the asylum accommodation that is thought to have been the intended target of the plot.
Batons, knives, iron bars and axes were found in the suspects' vehicles.
Hesam Akbari, a spokesperson for Stockholm police, told the TT news agency that members of the group were facing a number of charges.
""The (police) report now concerns three offences. Preparation for aggravated assault, incitement to aggravated assault and incitement to aggravated arson,"" he said.
Police added that all of those arrested were set to be questioned on Tuesday.
""They are Polish citizens and they belong to the far-right sphere,"" police spokesman Lars Alvarsjö told public broadcaster Swedish Radio.
The editor of Swedish anti-racism magazine Expo, Mikael Färnbo, told TT that they have previously observed close links between far-right communities in Sweden and Eastern Europe.
""In general terms alone we can say that we know that there are connections,"" he said.
The Aftonbladet daily reported that some of the suspects were living and working in Sweden.
Last month, dozens of masked men believed to belong to hooligan or neo-Nazi gangs gathered in central Stockholm and distributed leaflets calling for attacks on young migrants.
Three of the 14 men arrested on Monday evening were involved in the January incident, Alvarsjö told AFP.
Nynäshamn, some 60km south of the Swedish capital is a picturesque coastal town that is frequently used as a gateway to Stockholm's archipelago.
Swedish officials recently have called for stepped-up security at asylum accommodation across the country after an employee at a centre for unaccompanied child refugees was fatally stabbed in January.
However news of the alleged plot emerged as police appeared to make efforts to calm far-right sentiment in the country by releasing statistics which suggest that less than one percent of crimes in Sweden are linked to refugees.
Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and expects to receive around 100,000 more this year, despite tightening its borders."

Luxembourg, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, announced the extraordinary meeting, to be held on September 14th, late on Sunday following a joint call for action by Germany, France and Britain.
“The situation of migration phenomena outside and inside the European Union has recently taken unprecedented proportions,” it said in a statement.
The number of migrants reaching the EU's borders reached nearly 340,000 during the first seven months of the year, up from 123,500 during the same period in 2014, according to the bloc's border agency Frontex.
At least 2,300 migrants have died at sea since January during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers. Just last week, 71 decomposing bodies were discovered in an abandoned truck in Austria -- in a grim reminder of the ruthlessness of human traffickers.
Swedish justice and migration minister Morgan Johansson welcomed the extraordinary meeting and called for joint efforts to tackle the Europe-wide crisis.
“It is an issue which Sweden has been virtually alone in pushing, but it is becoming more and more obvious that it has to happen. I hope more countries realize that,” he told the TT news agency.
The meeting in Brussels is set to discuss international cooperation, measures to prevent trafficking and how to outline a return policy.

Sweden recorded the next biggest number of asylum applications in the EU in 2014 after Germany -- 13 percent, although as a proportion in relation to its population size, the country is shouldering the biggest burden in the bloc.
However there are signs that refugees are starting to shun the Nordic nation as news spreads about long waiting times and cumbersome bureaucracy in Sweden.
A report by Sweden's Migration Board (Migrationsverket) last month suggested that the number of predicted asylum seekers in 2015 would be around 74,000, compared to the 90,000 it suggested in February.

Friends of Gica, whose real name was Gheorge Hortolomei-Lupu, are speaking out after a teenage boy was arrested on Monday in connection with his death.
Iréne Linddahl, who works for local aid group Kyrkhjälpen, said she first met Gica four years ago when he came to a party hosted by her group in Huskvarna. He became regularly involved with Kyrkhjälpen’s efforts to help other homeless EU migrants in Sweden.
“He was friendly, grateful and kind,” Linddahl told Aftonbladet. “He lived outdoors and primarily devoted himself to begging.”
Gica’s body was discovered in a Huskvarna park earlier this month but it took police a week to determine that a murder had occurred. The police investigation then led to the teenager who was arrested on Monday. Police have also questioned two other boys in connection with the crime. Both are under the age of 15 and one is as young as 13 according to P4 Jönköping. One of the boys is suspected of assaulting the migrant on the same day as the alleged murder while the other is suspected of harassing the victim.

Videos of the teenagers beating and harassing the 48-year-old were reportedly circulated on social media.
Mikael Good, a volunteer who helped the homeless and other down-on-their-luck people in Huskvarna, also fondly remembered Gica and said he couldn’t think of any reason anyone would want to hurt him.
“I was completely destroyed [by the news]. I cannot understand why anyone would do this to a weak person who couldn’t defend himself,” Good told Aftonbladet.
Both Good and Linddahl said that Gica’s health had taken a serious turn in recent months and that he had lost a great deal of weight and had difficulty getting around.
According to Linddahl, Gica came to Sweden roughly four years ago from a town near Bacau in Romania. He reportedly lost his job at a printing company and got divorced shortly thereafter. This upending of his life led him to leave Romania. He spent time in several other EU countries before settling in Sweden.
""He probably thought people were nice here and that he had found a beautiful spot overlooking the lake and the mountains,"" Good said.
He worked in the Huskvarna area as a fruit picker for awhile before becoming a bottle collector and full-time beggar.
Kyrkhjälpen held a memorial for Gica that was attended by roughly 50 people, including a number of other Romanians and local Huskvarna residents.

""Swedish collective bargaining agreements should apply in Sweden,"" said party leader Stefan Lövfen on Wednesday at a press conference. ""It does not matter from which country the employee comes from nor where the employer is registered."" The Council of Europe's European Committee on Social Rights (ECSR) slammed Sweden as late as last week for what is known as the Laval Law, stating that it failed to guarantee equal rights for foreign guest workers. The law gets its name from a 2004 union blockade in Stockholm archipelago suburb Vaxholm, where a construction team from Latvian company Laval was building a school. The Social Democrat party and its traditional ally LO, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, said it was high time to make sure the client has the responsibility for salaries and taxes - and that such a responsibility would extend down the line of subcontractors, no matter how long the list. The conservative Labour Market Minister Elisabeth Svantesson responded to Wednesday's statement from the opposition by dubbing it ""protectionist"". ""Both social democracy and LO are giving voice to protectionism, and want to build a wall to keep out employees from other countries,"" she told the TT news agency. Following the Vaxholm conflict, the Swedish government legislated to make it harder for unions to enforce collective action in the defence of foreign workers' rights. The unions were also told to pay 2.7 million kronor ($392,000) for the Latvian company's subsequent court cases and ""general damages"".
The unions have all along maintained that the reforms restrict the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. ""The government believes in The Swedish Model with good conditions for all, but we should not close the doors to people from other countries,"" the labour market minister added. She defended the Laval Law, known as Lex Laval in Sweden, despite last week's critique from the Council of Europe. Svantesson said the law acted as a safeguard to make sure there is worker protection at the same time as allowing the free movement of services and labour.

Though entry-level jobs and state-subsidized “new start” jobs are the most common type of employment among newcomers to Sweden, only one in four of those jobs went to women last year.
That’s despite women accounting for 46 percent of the people of working age who were granted a residence permit in Sweden during the same period.
Thikra Hasan, chairwoman of the Iraqi-Swedish Association for Women and Children, believes that it can be difficult for women from Arabic backgrounds to take the jobs.
“Here in Sweden paternity leave is normal, but among Arabic men there are not many who want to take paternity leave and look after the kids,” she told SVT.
In addition, she also said that it is considered unusual among Arab women to work in what are traditionally considered male professions in their culture.
That in turn clashes with Swedish labour market policy, where the training provided tends to lean towards male-dominated professions.
According to Sara Berggren at the Swedish employment agency (Arbetsförmedlingen) professions that many newly-arrived women are interested in like becoming a nanny have less training options.
“They’re very expensive courses, I would say. For mechanics, machine operators and bus drivers there seem to be as many resources available as you like,” she told SVT."

Proposals to ensure a more balanced spread of refugees across the EU are expected to be put forward by the European Commission in Brussels on Wednesday, alongside plans to increase legal means for migrants to travel to Europe.
The move, first reported in Britain's The Times newspaper on Monday, aims to create legislation that would force all 28 member states to share responsibility for “mass influxes” of non-EU migrants during times of emergency.
Sweden's Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson has told The Local that he is “looking forward” to seeing the full Commission Agenda on the issue, and said media reports already suggest the EU's policy-making body is “on the right track” at a time when “it is clear we have to improve the responsibility sharing within the Union”.
Sweden dealt with more than 81,410 asylum cases between March 2014 and March 2015, while Germany processed the greatest number in the EU: 247,635. By contrast, the UK dealt with 29,340, while the figure for Netherlands was 23,780.
“Our Common European Asylum System is not very common in a situation where a handful of Member States are taking the responsibility for over 90 percent of the asylum seekers,” he said late on Monday.
“For the Common European Asylum System to be sustainable in the long run, a more even distribution of asylum seekers within the EU is needed.”
Italy and Austria are among the other member states backing the proposals, while a spokesperson for the UK Home Office told The Times that Prime Minister David Cameron's new Conservative government “will oppose any EU proposals to introduce a non-voluntary quota”.
“Mad and unfair” was the description Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban gave to the plan.
Germany is strongly in favour of the idea, having long pushed for quotas, while France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve also came out in support of the proposals on Monday.
“I think it is normal to share out the asylum claimants,” he said.
Under the reported proposals, the number of refugees sent to each EU country would in future be determined according to a formula which considers factors such as unemployment, economic performance, population size and the number of previous arrivals.

While asylum seekers generally enter Europe through Greece and Italy, nearly half of all asylum requests in 2014 were presented in Germany and Sweden, a sign of the continent's lopsided distribution.
Guterres' latest effort to rally other European countries comes days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel made global headlines for suggesting that immigration could become a greater challenge for the European Union than the Greek debt crisis.
""The issue of asylum could be the next major European project, in which we show whether we are really able to take joint action,"" she told ZDF public television on Sunday.

Following rising numbers of asylum applications from eastern European countries including Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria and Serbia, Merkel also called for the European Union to establish a list of safe countries of origin, where citizens are not generally under threat of violence or persecution.
She said she hoped this tactic would deter people from wasting their time making pointless applications, so that her country could focus on those fleeing Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
The number of refugees arriving in Germany was expected to reach 500,000 this year, but the Handelsblatt newspaper on Tuesday quoted government sources saying this figure could rise to 750,000.
New official figures are due to be published on Wednesday, and if that projection is confirmed, it would be a record and far more than the previous high in 1992, when Germany opened its doors to refugees fleeing the Balkans wars.

Sweden recorded the next biggest number of asylum applications in the EU in 2014 -- 13 percent, although as a proportion in relation to its population size, the country is shouldering the biggest burden in the bloc.
However there are signs that refugees are starting to shun the Nordic nation as news spreads about long waiting times and cumbersome bureaucracy in Sweden.
A report by Sweden's Migration Board (Migrationsverket) last month suggested that the number of predicted asylum seekers in 2015 would be around 74,000, compared to the 90,000 it suggested in February.
“The processing times are pretty long compared to Germany, which has a fast-track lane...in Sweden it is difficult to get housing and jobs; this affects people's choice of destination country,” Anders Danielsson, head of the Swedish Migration Board, told the TT newswire in July."

					17:44 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Sweden watches as EU migrant talks collapse,"UPDATED: EU nations have failed to agree on how many of the refugees that have arrived in the Mediterranean this year should be taken in by each member state after months of wrangling.
Migration ministers from all 28 EU member states met on Monday in an attempt to finalize European Commission plans to resettle 40,000 refugees based in Italy and Greece and another 20,000 asylum seekers from outside of Europe.
“All EU member states have to be prepared to take their responsibility. This is the worst humanitarian crisis in our time,” Sweden's migration minister Morgan Johansson told reporters when he arrived in Brussels.
But after several hours of talks, the European Commission's plan to ask all EU member states to take in a proportion of the refugees remained in limbo as some nations asked for more time before committing to a set quota.
Sweden, which already accepts the most asylum seekers per capita in the EU, offered ahead of the meeting to relocate just over 1,800 migrants as part of the scheme. Germany, which takes the greatest number of refugees in real terms, has signed up to 12,000.
The Nordic country had advocated mandatory quotas, which would have seen countries allocated a set of asylum seekers based on their population size, economic growth and former engagement with refugees.
But after several states voiced concerns about the strategy, including Hungary, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia, EU leaders agreed to make the quotas voluntary. The UK has chosen to avoid the plans entirely due to an existing EU agreement which allows it to ‘opt out' of some issues.
“In some member states there are extreme right-wing forces that push for an end to all commitments,” said Johansson ahead of the talks.
“It's about creating a new order in Europe where you can't just assume that only some countries will take their responsibility,” he added.
It is estimated that more than 1,800 migrants have died so far in 2015 while making their way to Europe from war-torn nations such as Syria, Iraq and Libya, in packed boats travelling in dangerous conditions.
Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallström, recently told The Local: “What if we lived in a war zone? We would also want to flee somewhere safe with our children, or try to secure a future elsewhere. It has to do with whether or not we are serious in the EU about our guiding principles – this will affect our credibility.”
But Sweden's open borders have been strongly criticised by opposition groups in recent months. The nationalist Sweden Democrats - backed by 12.9 percent of voters in the last general election - want the Nordic nation to limit immigration and several centre-right parties have mooted the idea of giving refugees temporary rather than permanent residency permits."

“They received information on why people are driven to flee,” he said.
“The most difficult challenge will be meeting these overcrowded boats,” he added. “It's a completely new kind of assignment for us, but something I have no doubt we can manage.”

Before the Poseidon set out on its mission from Gothenburg on May 21st, Home Affairs Minister Anders Ygeman spoke of what motivated the government to participate.
“It is the suffering we are seeing in the Mediterranean where thousands of people risk their lives in flimsy vessels,” he said.
“It was obvious to the government that Sweden should help.”

“This is not just about asylum procedure, it's about the safety of the accommodation,“ Sweden's Justice and Migration minister Morgan Johansson told Swedish Radio. “Adults should live with adults and children should live with children, which is why this should be done as early as possible in the procedure.”
According to the Swedish Migration Agency, more than 18,000 of the young men and women might warrant medical age tests this year and next year.
Sweden's migration law gives strong incentives for asylum seekers aged 18 or over to claim to be minors, and the Agency believes there is reason to doubt the claims of as many as 70 percent of asylum applicants who say they are between the ages of 15 and 17.
The tests are controversial in Sweden, however, with doctors arguing that there is as yet no method of reliably determining a person's age.
In April, the National Board of Health and Welfare judged that MRI scans of asylum seekers' knees provided the most reliable currently available age tests
At the end of last month, the government gave The National Board of Forensic Medicine responsibility for carrying out the new tests. It has now launched an inquiry into how best to carry them out, which is due to report in November.
Ann Lemne, project manager at the organisation, underlined the shortcomings of existing methods in a press release sent out in May.

As a result of the disappearances, the Swedish government agency tasked with representing the rights of minors could now be given a mandate to carry out in-depth interviews with children who return after going missing.
The Ombudsman for Children in Sweden ('Barnombudsmannen') is an agency charged with representing children regarding their rights and interests on the basis of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child. The goal of their proposed interviews is to analyze what children have experienced, and try to work out how their disappearances can be prevented in the future.
It is part of a 23-point program with which authorities and other bodies hope to protect children from crime and social deprivation in Sweden. The Swedish government will make a final decision on the mandate during a meeting on Wednesday.
On Monday, local radio station P4 Blekinge reported on the poor conditions that six unaccompanied refugee children in the southern Swedish province were living in. The children claimed that all six had shared the same basement at a foster home, that they were not given sufficient food and that their toilet usage was restricted.
In June, the human rights organization Human Rights Watch criticized Sweden's treatment of unaccompanied migrant children, highlighting the long waiting periods for asylum processing as well as a lack of adequate psychological care for those in need.
According to Human Rights Watch figures, more than 35,000 unaccompanied children sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, a significant increase from around 7000 in 2014."

""It does sound like a bit of a contradiction,"" Jörgen Hermansson, political scientist at Uppsala University, told The Local. ""You would expect that he would want them to go home. It definitely sounds interesting."" The Sweden Democrats party describes itself as ""the party for real jobs"", and one of the top job goals listed on the party's website is to ""stop labour migration to low-end jobs"". Oslo is home to some 50,000 Swedes, many of whom left their home country to take advantage of free immigration laws to work in catering and menial jobs. Nevertheless, Jimmie Åkesson defended the stop as a natural part of election campaigning. ""Many Swedes live in Norway and we think it's a good idea to visit Oslo on our election tour,"" Åkesson said in a statement before his stop. ""It will be exciting and interesting."" Martin Kinnunen, press secretary for the Sweden Democrats, said that the move was mostly aimed at increasing numbers of voters among the Swedes living in Norway. Indeed, only one of five Swedes living abroad votes in elections. And given that one in five young people living in Oslo is Swedish, it's not remarkable that Åkesson is out after the votes. ""It's more of a rule than an exception that youth in this region look for their first job in Norway,"" Elisabeth Andersson at the Karlstad jobs agency said in a statement. ""It's nearby, the availability of work is much better, and the pay is much higher."" Nurses can earn twice the salary in Norway as they do in Sweden. But highly-ranked jobs aren't the only ones shifting to Norway. The vast majority of Swedes working in Oslo work in hotels, shops, and restaurants - precisely the type of labour immigration the Sweden Democrats have said they want to prevent. But Åkesson probably doesn't view working in Norway as such a negative thing, Hermansson said - simply because it's Norway. ""When it comes down to it, it's a question of culture and identity for Åkesson. He believes there is a deep-rooted connection and cooperation within the Nordic countries. Nordic people, and particularly Norwegians, aren't strangers."" Kinnunen confirmed his musings. ""We have no problem working with Norway. We would like an even more encompassing cooperation within the Nordics.""
Simultaneously, Kinnunen said it's concerning that Swedes are going to Norway to get jobs which are available in Sweden. ""It's remarkable because we have significant labour migration to Sweden from countries outside of the EU to fill service jobs, and yet Swedes are going to Norway for the same jobs,"" Kinnunen told The Local ""It's a troubling situation which creates problems for both the Norwegian and Swedish labour markets."" Kinnunen also said that the Sweden Democrats are hoping to attack at the root of the problem, increasing pay and improving the work environment in Sweden ""so that Swedish youth don't have to leave for work"". Youth unemployment is about 9 percent in Norway, compared with 24 percent in Sweden. Åkesson's speech on Friday, held at Stortinget in Oslo, was met with mixed responses - and multiple protests. ""I'm against Swedes of the nationalistic type,"" demonstrator Martin Tjersland told Norwegian TV2. Tjersland stood with his back to Åkesson throughout the speech. Other protesters stood with a large black banner proclaiming ""No racists on our streets"", and a drawing of a man with a baseball bat running towards SD's symbolic flower. But supporters were also in place, with several people waving signs saying ""Heja Jimmie"" (Go Jimmie). Of the three experts The Local asked, not one was aware of another Swedish party leader who had included international stops on an election tour. Hermansson said that the other parties could learn something from Åkesson's ""tactical visit"". ""It would be worthwhile for the Alliance to fight for votes from Swedes abroad,"" Hermansson said. ""Politicians don't usually include Swedes abroad in such an active way."""

Although the agency would not name the suspected groups the agents recruited for, a source told Swedish tabloid Expressen that militant Islamist group Isis is thought to be among them. The role of the agency’s resettlement assistants was to help newly arrived migrants find work by assisting them with, for example, the language or helping them with paperwork.
Some of the assistants are also suspected of having been involved in fraudulent activities and pressing people for bribes in order to help them. “It’s to do with loans or gifts, like tablets, mobile phones and sometimes cash, in order to get connected to a specific assistant,” he was quoted as saying to Expressen.

The camp has been occupied by around 200 people for months, but following a decision from Malmö city council's environmental committee, they were asked to leave the camp by 4pm on Sunday or face eviction.
However, police failed to show up, with some of the residents remaining there overnight amid rumours that it would be cleared on Monday morning instead.
As the city's rush hour got under way, campaigners arrived at the camp to show their support for the EU migrants, who have been living in caravans, tents, shacks and cars on the land, which is in an industrial area of Sweden's third largest city.
""They can lift us out. If we do not get to stay here we will be forced to sleep on the street,"" one 22-year-old, named simply as Daniel from Romania, told the TT news agency.

Under Swedish law both locals and visitors alike usually have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.
The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants – who are mainly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria – for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.
Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.
Some municipalities in other parts of Sweden have already evicted groups of Roma from public land including in the capital, Stockholm.
Malmö city council is offering accommodation for five nights for around 50 people from the camp and trying to find help for the migrants in their home villages in Romania."

According to a programme to be broadcast on Wednesday night, Swedish forestry giants SCA and Holmen hire agents to recruit migrant workers from Cameroon, luring them to Sweden with false promises of good pay.
The practice has been going on for the past two years and involves sending documents to the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) indicating the workers will earn 18,500 kronor ($2,825) per month and which have been approved by the union.
But the promised wages appear only to exist on paper, according to Uppdrag granskning.
When the Cameroonian workers arrive in the forests of northern Sweden, they are forced to carry out piece work for much lower pay.
They were also forced to pay hefty fees to the agents before being allowed to start working in the first place.
When some of the workers complained, the agent threatened to burn down their homes back in Cameroon, according to the SVT report.
Six months after the end of the planting season, many of the Cameroonian workers remain in Sweden as undocumented immigrants.
They lack housing, money, and work and are afraid to return home because they lack money to pay off the debts incurred to make the journey to Sweden.
The Swedish forestry firms told Uppdrag granskning they were also ""duped"" by the recruiting agents, but claim they have no obligation to help the workers with their predicament.

""What's most upsetting is that you don't know the rules,"" Palmer told Sveriges Televison (SVT), whose sports reporters earlier this year revealed that a Ukrainian player with the Lindesberg Volleyball team in central Sweden, which reached the Swedish league finals last season, had barely been paid at all.
To import non-EU employees to Sweden, the person-in-question must earn a minimum of 14,300 kronor ($2,200) a month, but Palmer added to the simmering fracas by revealing she had been paid about 5,000 kronor a month.
Spiker Nadya Greseva, meanwhile, has now been relegated to her home country of Ukraine after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) did not renew her work visa. Local media had shone the spotlight on the club having two contracts - one that followed the legal minimum of 14,300, while Greseva pocketed no more than 2,400 kronor ($370) a month.
Lindesberg clue head Roger Larsson resigned after details of Greseva's working conditions were made public.
The scandal has left the Swedish Volleyball Association up in arms, with chairman Saffet Eraybars telling SVT that Lindesberg's treatment of its foreign-born stars was ""totally irresponsible and completely unacceptable"". He further urged non-EU players with any questions about their contracts and pay to get in touch with the association.
Yet, Lindesberg appeared not to be the only volleyball club toying with the rules.
Katrineholm Volley has, according to reports in the local media, paid several players off the books, with five players not paying taxes. Cross-referenced with the minimum requirements stipulated by the Migration Board, their total pay should have amounted to between 40,000 and 60,000 kronor but the Tax Agency (Skatteverket) has no record of their income.

""Those who have been denied entry or received deportation orders should leave the country,"" Reinfeldt told Svergies Television (SVT) on Sunday.
""Should people be allowed to stay simply because they go into hiding for a few weeks? That would be a very strange society.""
The prime minister's comments come in response to an ongoing debate in Sweden about law enforcement's approach to carrying out deportation orders.
Critics have accused police in Stockholm of racial profiling in asking ""non-Swedish looking"" commuters for identification. Others have questioned whether police should be prioritizing deportation order enforcement over traditional law enforcement operations.
While police announced earlier in March that they had abandoned random ID-checks, thousands took to the streets to protest the initiative, known as the Reva project, which stands for Rättssäkert och effektivt verkställighetsarbete ('Legal and effective execution of policy').
The debate gained new life last week when Swedish author Jonas Hassen Khemiri published an open letter in the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper challenging Justice Minister Beatrice Ask to ""change skin"" with him.
The article generated was widely shared on social media and prompted many to share their experiences of being victimized by what Khemiri referred to as Sweden's ""structural racism"".
When asked about the article, Reinfeldt refused to comment specifically on the controversial methods other than to point out that police have said the tactics are no longer in use.
""I'm not here to discuss matters related to police operations, I'm responsible more for making laws,"" he said.
Reinfeldt added, however, that since 2009 the government has pushed immigration and law enforcement authorities in Sweden to do a better job of enforcing deportation orders.
According to the prime minister, no party in the Riksdag is currently in favour of open borders, although the proposal has been discussed recently within the Centre Party.
""I want to be clear that I've told the police that in Sweden, everyone is equal before the law,"" he said, adding he sees no reason to change Sweden's laws.
""If you've been rejected in a country with the most generous asylum and migration rules in the entire developed world, I think you should respect the decision,"" Reinfeldt said.

In a 32-page report released on June 9th, the US-based human rights watchdog said Sweden, which in 2015 saw a significant increase in the arrival of unaccompanied children, needs to do more to ensure they get special protection.
The watchdog stressed that children endure long delays in being appointed a legal guardian in Sweden, that they often experience problems with housing, and that there is a need for more support for traumatized girls in particular.
One of the main problems is Sweden’s lengthy asylum process, according to report author Rebecca Riddell.
“It can often take months. For children who fled the Taliban or Islamic State, the waiting and fear of being sent back is extremely painful. I’ve talked to children who can't eat or sleep because of the turmoil,” she told Svenska Dagbladet.
In compiling the report, Human Rights Watch investigators visited seven different Swedish municipalities and interviewed 50 refugee children who came to Sweden unaccompanied, as well as national and local officials and service providers.
It recommended that the Swedish government should provide support to municipalities in order to identify shortcomings and improve services, and that priority should be given to asylum applications of unaccompanied children.
According to figures quoted by Human Rights Watch, more than 35,000 unaccompanied children sought asylum in Sweden in 2015, a significant increase from around 7000 in 2014."

However, after reports of poor conditions and violence, contributor Jacob Sommer heads to a campsite in eastern Sweden to find out more.
A recent spike in violence and reports of poor working and living conditions of the migrant berry pickers have raised concerns among Swedes and brought the merit of the European Union's labor policies into question.
According to migrant labour expert Mats Kullander of Oxford Research, a Stockholm-based think tank, the problem lies in the lack of employment contracts for EU migrant workers.
“EU citizens are no longer required to have an employment contract. That has been the most serious change in recent years,” he told The Local.
By contrast, berry pickers from outside the EU are only permitted to work in Sweden when they have a contract guaranteeing them a monthly wage as well as certain living expenses for the duration of their stay in Sweden.
Incidents of theft, assault and even allegations of human trafficking have arisen in recent weeks in the normally tranquil region around the city of Uppsala, some 70 kilometres north of Stockholm.
At an isolated campsite in the woods about two kilometers from Mehedeby, Turkish-speaking Bulgarians expressed their disappointment with what they have found in Sweden.
“Last year we got paid 25 kronor ($3.67) per kilo, this year it's 12 kronor per kilo,” said one Bulgarian man from the Baltic Mountains who refused to give his name.
Wild blueberries sold by street vendors in Sweden typically sell in 150 gramme containers for about 25 kronor each. If bought by the kilo for 12 kronor each that would amount to a vendor's profit of nearly 1,300 percent.
In addition to the low price for berries, the squalid conditions evident in the migrants' camp are on par with that of a refugee camp.
The camp which houses about 100 Bulgarians, including children, had no toilets, showers, electricity, or sources of clean drinking water.
Violent incidents have also taken place including recent stone-throwing and brawling amongst the workers, leading to both arrests and hospitalizations.
Security is the main concern for Michael, a 25-year-old Bulgarian father of two living at the Mehedeby campsite. He claimed that some Swedes had been aggressive toward the migrant workers.
“We cannot feel safe because they were trying to attack us. I don't know why, maybe they have some reason. Maybe they've seen someone stealing from them and have followed him here. I don't know why,” he told The Local.
Last week approximately 200 Bulgarians were repatriated following an accusation of human trafficking and a subsequent sit-in by at least 100 Bulgarians at their country's embassy in Stockholm.
“There were two people who came to the police and told us that they were here against their free will,"" explained Lisa Sannervik of the Uppsala police to The Local.
""The police started an investigation and one person, a 43 year old man, was arrested. These three people involved have now left for Bulgaria.”
Solutions to the security, economic, and living condition problems of the migrants have not been easily ascertainable.
According to Michael, the situation would improve by having the Bulgarians register their addresses and license plate numbers with Swedish authorities.
“Next year I just want the community to give us some place where we can stay. Also, I want the police to record all the license plates of the cars of those living there,"" he said, adding that such actions would make police reports simpler for any potential victims.
For Kullander, the next step is to acquire better information about the conditions of the migrant workers while also distributing information regarding the actual labor conditions in Sweden to would-be migrants still in Bulgaria.
“We have many questions unanswered. How many workers are in Sweden right now? Nobody knows exactly. Where do they come from? How much do they get paid, and so on. That issue has to be researched further,” he said.
“There needs to be better information for those people hoping to make an income explaining what the chances of that happening actually are.”

In the Stockholm electoral district, two current MPs with strong union ties - Börje Vestlund, 53, and Teres Lindberg, 39 - have been shuffled so far down the party's electoral list they are not likely to make it back into parliament. The party defended its move to make its representation more in tune with multicultural Sweden. ""It has to affect someone,"" party greyback and electoral chief Bosse Ringholm told Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper on Wednedsay. ""Middle-aged people have had to move, people around 50 who have been dominant on the lists for decades."" The party's Stockholm municipal district head Veronica Palm also defended the ambition, which nonetheless has its critics. Earlier in the summer, when the main opposition party began its internal recruitment drive, party members began discussing the new quota system in earnest, including the congress decision to make sure one in four candidates was younger than 35. ""There are a lot of people between the ages of 40 and 50 who have long waited for the babyboomers to retire,"" a party member told The Local. ""They are not happy having to let in young talent who haven't had to show the same patience as they."" Twenty-four-year-old law student Lawén Redar has been moved up to eighth place in the parliamentary list for Stockholm. If the Social Democrats do as badly as last time in the elections, however, she may not make it to parliament. Higher up on the list, and the only non-Nordic origin candidate in the top six, is Syriac-Swedish lawyer Emanuel Öz. The problem in Stockholm is that it's a natural seat for not only the party leadership - with chairman Stefan Löfven and party secretary Carin Jämtin at the top - but also for candidates with long experience from the political arena, like Ylva Johansson. Quotas are nothing new to the leftwing party. Back in the 1990s, due to its bombastic women's wing, secured the ""every second place for the ladies"" approach to its electoral lists - Sweden has proportional representation, rather than the UK constituency model. The push to diversify the Social Democrats' lists with candidates of different origins is new for the 2014 elections, however, as the party tempts to pry power out of the hands of the conservative government that has ruled Sweden for seven years."

					11:05 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,'Tide turning' on Sweden's attitude to immigration: report,"Sweden's progressive attitude towards immigration is changing, according to a new report on racism and migration in the EU.
NGO network the European Network Against Racism (ENAR) carried out a report on racism and discrimination in the context of migration across 26 EU countries, and when it comes to Sweden, researchers concluded that while the country appears to be more progressive than other EU nations on immigration, the tide is turning.
The report highlights examples of attacks on migrants, anti-migrant discourse, and far-right vigilante activity in Sweden.
""In terms of immigration and integration policies it appears that Sweden is more progressive than other countries, but the tide is also turning. A number of restrictions to existing migration and integration policies have been introduced, and the media discourse has shifted from positive welcoming of refugees and asylum seekers to portraying migration, and by extension, migrants, as a problem,"" ENAR press spokesperson Georgina Siklossy told The Local.
""This also has an impact on people who have lived in Sweden for two or three generations and continue to be regarded as 'alien elements',"" she added.
Citing figures recorded by the Kantor Center, the report notes that 43 arson attacks against asylum seeker accommodation occurred in Sweden in 2015, while in 2016 a group of black-clad masked men assaulted people who looked 'foreign' in Stockholm.
READ ALSO: New stats on asylum homes torched in Sweden in 2016
Those attacks are likely linked to wider anti-migrant debates in Sweden, according to Siklossy:
""Violence against migrants is fuelled by hateful anti-migrant discourse, although it is complex and difficult to prove a direct correlation between the two. Nevertheless, civil society organizations across Europe report that such discourse legitimises violent attacks, emboldens people with racist views to take action, and contributes to an overall climate of hostility towards migrants.""
""The perpetrators of such attacks are hard to determine, although several are involved in far-right groups or movements, and it's clear far-right groups and parties play a role in opposition to asylum centres in this instance, distributing leaflets and mobilizing their supporters,"" the ENAR spokesperson added.
ENAR's report observes that far-right groups have been successful in setting the tone on migration, and that media outlets ""conflate the Muslim community with issues of terrorism and security"".
One person the organization interviewed said they felt that in Sweden ""the media image around migrants basically means a Muslim, and that coverage about Muslims – in this case people who fled or have come here because of conflicts – are associated with what has become known as extremism"".
Sweden is also one of several EU Member States where ""the narrative purports that 'white' European women must be protected from predatory migrant Muslim men,"" ENAR's study adds.
Anti-Roma adverts launched by the Sweden Democrats (SD) in the Stockholm subway in 2015 meanwhile make it ""as obvious as possible that certain migrants are not welcome"" and normalize racism against Roma people.
The adverts sparked strong reactions however, and ""individuals as well as organizations"" condemned them, ENAR elaborates, but it is difficult to judge what proportion of the Swedish population is against the sentiments according to Siklossy:
""The research doesn't go more deeply into this aspect. Of course it's very positive that there was public condemnation of the advertising, but it is difficult to include from that instance that the vast majority of Swedes are against such sentiments, notably in the context of increasing support for SD in the 2014 elections.""

In its conclusion, the report argues that across the EU there have been few specific efforts made to combat discrimination through legislative measures, while in contrast there are many examples of increasingly restrictive policies.
Most of the focus is on security and return measures, ENAR believes, while more attention needs to be given to two-way integration instead.
""There is no such thing as homogeneous nation-states in Europe but until this is understood more clearly by EU Member Sates, anti-migrant sentiments and racism will continue,"" the study concludes.

“The challenge for the Nordic region is not an internal one, but the fact that Schengen's outer borders have broken down,” Solberg said.
“We must now make sure that the outer borders work,” she added as Europe struggles to cope with its worst refugee crisis since World War Two.
Schengen, which permits citizens of 26 states including non-EU member Norway to travel without passport formalities, is creaking under the strain of an unending flood of new arrivals with Germany, Austria and Slovakia reimposing border checks.
Solberg, whose Conservative Party is in a ruling coalition with the anti-immigration Progress Party, echoed concerns over Schengen expressed by French President Francois Hollande on Thursday.
Speaking to the AFP news agency, Hollande said Schengen was “in danger” due to the absence of registration centres to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants as EU states seek to share out some 120,000 asylum seekers, most fleeing the war in Syria.
Hollande said if there were no controls at the EU's external borders, states would feel obliged to restore national borders and controls “and it will be the end of Schengen.”
Solberg was speaking after a joint meeting with colleagues from fellow Nordic states hosted by Denmark.
Norway controls an external EU frontier with Russia, a border which has been crossed by more than 250 Syrian refugees so far this year.
Sweden's Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said “all those who have the right to asylum should be given it. Those who do not have the right should be sent back.”
And Danish counterpart Lars Lokke Rasmussen, a Liberal, agreed, saying: “Those who do not need protection should be sent back as quickly as possible.”
The crisis has sparked some disagreement between the Nordic states with Stockholm criticising Copenhagen for waving through some migrants to Sweden to make asylum claims.
Finland then criticised Sweden for doing the same in allowing a group of mainly Iraqi migrants to cross the border to make their own claims."

Eyewitnesses notified police late Saturday night to say that three or four men with axes had smashed through the safety glass at the facility, which houses immigrants who are awaiting deportation.
""It was a very dramatic event and very unfortunate,"" Tommy Harnesk of the Migration Board told the TT news agency.
According to Harnesk, witnesses heard several loud crashes in one of the rooms at the facility. When staff members ran to the scene, they realized that a breakout was underway and attempted to enter the room. When they finally managed to open the door, the saw several people jump out of a broken window.
The floor of the room was littered with glass shards and an axe was left lying on the ground outside.
Local police told Sveriges Television (SVT) that seven or eight people were involved in the breakout and that the three people who escaped were born in 1976, 1979, and 1983.
One of the escapees was Georgian, one Russian, while the nationality of the third was unknown, the police added.
Police have confiscated the axe and searched the scene, but no arrests have been made.
""The mood at the facility is one of concern in the wake of an event like this. Staff members have made sure that no one else can escape, but have also tried to calm down the other people housed in the facility so we can try to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,"" said Harnesk.
A similar breakout took place at a facility in Skåne in southern Sweden last spring. And in November 2011, a Russian citizen escaped from the Gävle facility under dramatic circumstances during which several shots were fired and two employees were threatened.
However, such violent escapes are nevertheless rare.
""Security isn't as strong as at a prison. Those who stay here aren't criminals and haven't committed any crimes, but are often staying here because they are going to be deported,"" Harnesk.

Skolverket have said there are gaps in the Education Act meaning that it is difficult to interpret which children of EU citizens can be granted a school place. They stated that children who are only in Sweden for a short period could potentially miss out on an education. ""The right to an education is regulated by the Swedish education act.

Researchers found that of those tested, migrant children were far more likely to be misclassified as adults than vice versa, the findings published in the International Journal of Legal Medicine by scientists at the Chalmers technical university of Gothenburg show.
The Swedish government ordered the national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) to start carrying out medical age tests in 2017 after doubts were raised over whether all those who were being processed as minors were in fact underage.
Age was crucial in determining how the asylum seekers' applications were processed, as unaccompanied minors can only be returned to their home countries if they have a family member or other guardian who can provide them with somewhere to live.
The tests included X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists. However, the Gothenburg scientists behind the new study say that the combined method of teeth and knee tests were never tested for reliability, for example by testing the measures on people whose ages were known.
In total, 9,617 men and 337 women underwent the tests in 2017, and according to the study, an estimated 15 percent of the males were under 18 years old. These children faced a 33 percent chance of being classified as adults, whereas adult men faced a seven percent likelihood of being classified as children.
There are several reasons why the age of those who arrive in Sweden might be unclear, which is why the tests were called for.
Many of the asylum seekers who arrived in Sweden between 2014 and 2016 lack identity documents, with many coming from unstable regions where they may have lost many of their belongings. Another factor is that their countries of origin often do not have the same structures in place to record birthdates as Sweden does, so it's not unusual for people not to know their exact age."

					17:04 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,"Sweden bad, Norway good, Trump better? I'm confused","There is something intangible about Sweden that creates an urge to portray it in simplistic, catch-all terms – be it as a socialist paradise where everything is perfect, or an internationalist hell where multiculturalism has killed a once ideal society. The truth, argues The Local's reporter Lee Roden, lies somewhere in the middle.
A recent article by Republican senator Tom Cotton and Republican congressman Mike Pompeo in the Wall Street Journal (“What We Learned in Scandinavia About Migrants”) opts for the latter stereotype. The basic premise of the piece is that Sweden has dealt horrifically with the refugee crisis, Norway has handled it perfectly, and that the USA should learn from that by listening to Donald Trump.
Confused? You aren't the only one. Fortunately, Cotton and Pompeo know Norway and Sweden inside out. After all, they “recently visited Norway and Sweden to understand more about the European migrant crisis”. And there was me thinking that the refugee crisis was a complex issue that requires more than a mere visit to adequately grasp (and in truth, probably isn't fully grasped by most people who live here). The writers in question aren't the first to propagate such a simplistic view on Sweden, by the way, they just happen to be the most recent.
To quickly establish the Norway = good, Sweden = bad dichotomy, the piece wastes no time in creating a handy lists all of the things Norway has done well and that Sweden, conversely, has botched. The Norwegians built a border fence, reduced migrant benefits, and put out adverts in foreign countries warning people thinking of coming that they will be deported if they do not face war or persecution. All to much success, we are told.
Sweden, meanwhile, “threw open its doors in 2013” (note the dramatic language here), bringing in migrants who are disproportionately poor (poor = bad), young (young = bad), undereducated (definitely bad, who deserves an education?) conservatively Muslim (in case you're not on message yet, that's bad too) and possess virtually no Swedish-language skills.
No Swedish skills you say? On the bright side, that should help them integrate with large swathes of the British, Australian and, dare I say it, American community in Sweden.
We're then informed that this mass influx of refugees to Sweden and a lack of debate around the issue directly led to the rise of an “immigration-restrictionist” party (not anti-immigration, “immigration-restrictionist”), which in turn created a “hamstrung minority government” in 2014 when the left and right refused to work with them.
If you blink you may miss it, but there's a leap there that deserves some further inspection. Did a vacuum created by failing to listen to a broader range of views on immigration lead to the rise of the Sweden Democrats? Most likely. Did the success of the Sweden Democrats then create a “hamstrung minority government” in 2014? With more than two thirds of the post WWII governments in Sweden minority-led, the truth is that the current form of government is more akin to business as usual than a radical shift. Perhaps the writers missed that on their educational visit to Scandinavia.
Sweden's concession of implementing border controls is then mentioned, but strangely, these aren't praised in the way that Norway's were earlier in the piece, despite the number of refugees forecast to enter the country in 2016 recently being halved (which presumably would be seen as a positive by the authors). Instead, they move on to detail that seven percent of the 2016 Swedish budget will be allocated to “migrant services”, and that, terrifyingly, “no one knows where the new money will come from.”
Less terrifying perhaps is that Sweden has just been named the sixth most competitive economy in the world (thanks in part to robust economic growth in 2016), or that it is comfortably outperforming European giants like Germany and Britain this year. Or that is experiencing the best economic growth in the Nordics (even better than those clever Norwegians, fences and all). Those points aren't deemed relevant, because they don't help illustrate the idea that Sweden is on the brink of financial turmoil because of the refugee crisis. No one knows where the new money will come from, remember.
Putting flippancy aside, there's a serious point to be made here about how time and time again people parachute into Sweden, stay a few days, then make broad conclusions about this for many foreign but vaguely recognizable place to suit their own agenda. Unfortunately, while it doesn't necessarily make the best headlines, nor evoke the strongest emotions (and in the internet age, emotional reaction is king) the truth about Sweden almost always lies somewhere in the middle.
Like any country coming to terms with a rapidly changing, increasingly global world, there are legitimate problems here. There are certainly legitimate challenges to be dealt with around immigration and the impact it is having on what until not so long ago was a largely monocultural society, too, but to reduce those issues to a few short paragraphs with little context then use that to make a partisan value judgment on the state of the place is dangerous.
If you want to know what's happening in Sweden, perhaps read The Local. We live here, we work here, we report here and at the minimum, we engage with people here. We don't necessarily have all of the answers, but we'll at least attempt to draw on our knowledge, the specialist knowledge of others, and provide some balance in our assessment of what is happening in this fascinating country. It deserves as much. Or rather, readers deserve as much."

According to a survey of the 25 most serious attacks against EU migrants reported to police since 2014, conducted by Swedish magazine Expo, only five of the attacks led to prosecution.
Attacks include arson, suspected cases of abuse and violence and attacks against sleeping people.
Many of the attacks are suspected of being racially motivated.
According to the survey, which was published in July, there have been at least 76 attacks against beggars in the last 18 months.
On Thursday police launched an investigation after shots were fired at two homeless EU migrants sleeping in a car in Boden, northern Sweden. No one was injured.

And two months ago, two people were assaulted in central Stockholm by a passerby throwing acid at them. Two weeks earlier a beggar was targeted with a firecracker.
Thousands of EU migrants are estimated to have travelled to Sweden in recent years, with one recent study suggesting the number has doubled to 4000 people over the past 12 months.
Most of them are members of the Roma community – one of the EU's largest minority groups – and arrive as EU tourists under the right to Freedom of Movement. Many live in tents or caravans and make a living by asking passersby for money outside shops and underground stations."

					14:05 CET+01:00				", The Local,Massive Malmö migrant camp to be shut down,"More than 200 mostly Roma migrants who have been living in a shanty camp on the outskirts of southern Sweden's largest city have been told they're being evicted from the site.
The migrants have been living in tents, caravans, shacks and cars in an industrial area for months, sparking an intense debate in the city.
But Malmö's environmental committee said on Tuesday that the camp needed to be emptied and cleaned up and announced that residents had until 4pm on November 1st to either leave or face eviction by police.
Jeanette Silow, head of the committee, told Swedish media that the decision had been made to resolve what she called a ""difficult situation"" for others living nearby.
However the local council said that it would be creating a winter shelter with space for 40 people, to ensure that vulnerable people could be offered emergency accommodation.
As politicians met at Malmö city hall to finalize the details, around 50 of the camp's residents gathered outside to protest against the decision.
""The camp means everything to us. It is our home, this is where we live and eat,"" Sonia Dumitru told the TT news agency.
Meanwhile Johanna Nilsson, a spokesperson for Sweden's Roma Rights Network (Nätverket romers rättigheter) also criticized the move.
""To make this kind of decision without offering a worthy place to direct people to (...) clearly shows that you are not interested in finding a long term solution – neither for these Roma people nor the city as a whole,"" she said.
Under Swedish law both locals and visitors alike currently have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.
The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants –who are mainly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria – for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.
Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.
Some municipalities in other parts of Sweden have already evicted groups of Roma from public land including in the capital, Stockholm."

					16:27 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Baby boom: Sweden near top of European fertility table,"France and Sweden have the highest fertility rates in Europe but births across the EU are less than needed to replenish the population naturally, the bloc's statistics agency said on Wednesday.
Spain and Italy had the lowest birth rates, with countries in southern Europe, which has suffered most from economic problems in recent years, generally lower than those in the north.
Across the 28-nation European Union, 5.148 million babies were born in 2016, the last year for which figures were available, compared to 5.103 million in 2015, Eurostat announced.
Overall the total fertility rate was 1.60 births per woman, well short of the 2.1 live births per woman that Eurostat says is ""considered to be the replacement level in developed countries"".
France led the way with a fertility rate of 1.92 births per woman, followed by Sweden (1.85), Ireland (1.81), Denmark and the United Kingdom (both on 1.79), the figures showed.
Spain and Italy were the lowest on 1.34 births per woman, followed by Portugal (1.36), Cyprus and Malta (both 1.37), Greece (1.38) and Poland (1.39).

Germany, where the rate is 1.59 births per woman, noted a record number of babies in 2016 at 792,131, boosted by an increase in births by non-German women following large numbers of migrant arrivals.
The federal statistics authority Destatis, who released the figures Wednesday, said while German women had some 3.0 percent more babies, non-German births increased 25 percent.
Declining birth rate
Women in the EU had their first child on average at 29 years old, with the youngest in Bulgaria (26 years) and the oldest in Italy (31 years), Eurostat said.
The highest shares of births to teenage mothers were in Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.
Finland led the way for large families with one in ten mothers having their fourth or subsequent child.
Europeans have been having fewer children for decades, and a slight rebound since reaching a low of 5.0 million in 2002 has largely stalled since 2014.
Eurostat said in a statement last year that the 2.1 replenishment level was the ""average number of live births per woman required to keep the population size constant in the absence of migration.""
Migration is a political hot potato in the European Union with right-wing parties making gains in elections in Italy and Germany recently on the back of anti-immigration platforms.
The issue has been sensitive since the 2015 migration crisis during which more than one million refugees and migrants came to Europe, many of them fleeing the war in Syria.

We are a key part of Sweden's future',"OPINION: Ali Omumi is leaving Sweden after his work permit was rejected over errors made by his employers. He explains why he chose to fight the decision, and why Sweden needs to change how it views and treats its foreign professionals.
Sweden is among the top countries in the world in areas such as new businesses, innovation and technology, economy, healthcare, education, transparency, gender equality, and many more. Sweden has a lot to be proud of.
But we cannot ignore the contribution made by the foreign workforce in this country. Going back all the way to the 1500s, when the Walloons came here to work in mining and other industries, migrant labour in Sweden has been a win-win situation for centuries.
Sweden provided security and stability, and immigrant workers have brought their skills, experiences and labour. Sweden's success and growth thanks to diversity is undeniable.
MEMBERS Q&A: Why is Sweden deporting skilled foreign workers?
Ali Omumi with his wife and daughter. Photo: Ali Omumi
Since I first posted on Facebook about my own case [Omumi was ordered to leave Sweden due to administrative errors made by a former employer], I have received literally thousands of heartwarming messages of support from Swedes. So many told me that they were ""ashamed to be Swedish"" because of what has happened to me and my family. They wanted us to ""kämpa"" (fight) and repeatedly wrote ""ni måste stanna i Sverige"" (You have to stay in Sweden).
On the other hand, when I read about developer Tayyab Shabab who faced this exact same situation, when he started his new life in Germany, he said his only regret was ""not moving to Germany earlier"".
So I have decided to fight. Or rather, 'we' have decided, since my wife and my four-year-old daughter are tied to my visa. There are others who have helped, [industrial company and Omumi's employer] ABB, friends and family.
And we have fought every day. Imagine building a life somewhere and having no control over it being taken away – the stress penetrates everything. My high blood pressure, my wife's depression and our four-year old daughter's stammer are all constant parts of our life now. In the past year and a half I have not been able to invite my father, who has Stage 4 cancer, my mother or my sister to Sweden, nor I have I been able to leave Sweden to meet them.

In late 2017, the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce estimated that there were more than 13,700 people in limbo, waiting to see if their work permit extensions would be denied. People like me, Tayyab, and many others. None of us came to Sweden by accident. We all chose Sweden for a better, more secure and stable life.
READ ALSO: 'I'm being deported because I didn't take vacation, but Sweden is my home'
In my case, there were two other options, but we chose Sweden and Sweden chose us. We wanted the same things all Swedes want: a safe place for a family, a stable economy, and we also had some relatives here. Sweden has always been our first choice, and I was fortunate to be chosen by ABB.
When we look at this crisis from the outside, it seems so simple. There are thousands of work permit holders here who have jobs, and our employers want to keep us.
Meanwhile, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise's recruitment survey in 2018 shows Sweden is experiencing the biggest need for skilled workers since the financial crisis. In the same report, 40 percent of Swedish companies included in the survey reported that they had reduced sales or were forced to turn down new business because of lack of skilled workers. Dagens Medicin has reported that 5,000 healthcare centres will have to close during summer because of lack of workers.

So, why are people who already have jobs – good jobs – being deported? How do these expulsions benefit Sweden? Why are we seen as a threat to Sweden, to the immigration authorities, and to the Swedish workforce? Why can't we be seen as assets to the country?
On the other hand, the same government has suggested an amnesty for asylum seekers, whether they are completely eligible for asylum or not. Don't we deserve the same or better?
On June 7th, Sweden's immigration minister Heléne Fritzon responded to a question asked by MP Mats Persson in parliament about the worker deportations, which related specifically to my case. Her answer put the blame on the previous government for flaws in the law.
I am an engineer, not a politician. Just like the other thousands of workers, I do not even have the right to vote in the upcoming elections. But we all know how politics and elections can affect those with no voice.
The migration policy and authorities have only advanced this hypocrisy. It was the interpretation of migration law, not the law itself, which changes: more people are being and have been deported because the Migration Agency deliberately looked for minor mistakes.
Many people had their permits extended once, but were denied their permanent residency permits later on because of minor mistakes in the first period of their permit. In 2017, 400 workers per month were deported.

I am one of the lucky ones. I believe I have one of the best employers in Sweden, I have all of ABB behind me. I'll find my way eventually, maybe in Germany, Canada, or Iran… but this is my home, I want to stay in Sweden.
Not everyone is as lucky as me. And that's why Sweden, a world leader in civil liberties should never treat foreign workers like second-class citizens, inhabitants or ‘expendables'. We are workers, we are taxpayers, and we are part of Sweden!!!
I have talked to so many reporters. One of them asked: ""Do you think this will change soon?""
""Yes!"" I answered, ""Sweden is a free and democratic country. Swedish people and employers need us here – so the authorities cannot act against it"". Swedes will show this by voting against kompetensutvisning. I might have to leave Sweden and live somewhere else, but I will not give up this fight.
And I am thankful to the work of Diversify Foundation together with The Local and WPHA [Work Permit Holders Association] to give us a voice, and Swedish employers a chance to say what potential there is.
Please do not be afraid of us foreign workers. Rather, please see us as a critical part of Sweden's growth and future.

				4 December 2017
				12:39 CET+01:00			 
					12:39 CET+01:00				", The Local,Impact of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests revealed,"The results of medical age assessments on asylum seekers who arrived in Sweden as unaccompanied minors show that many were older than they claimed.
The national forensic medicine agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the checks earlier this year after doubts were raised over whether all those who were being processed as minors were in fact underage.
The Migration Agency has so far made 5,700 decisions on the basis of assessments carried out by Rättsmedicinalverket. In 79 percent of those cases the agency decided to formally consider the applicant as older than they had initially claimed in their asylum application, reports Svenska Dagbladet (SvD).
Between mid-March and late October, Rättsmedicinalverket carried out a total of 7,858 age assessments. Of those, it found that their examination suggested 6,628 were 18 or older, and 112 ""possibly"" 18 or older.
However, in 1,077 cases, Rättsmedicinalverket found that the applicant was possibly younger than 18. SvD reports that 430 of these had stated they were adults when they first applied for asylum in Sweden.
“In these cases, we judged that the asylum seekers were in fact underage, in contradiction with the information they themselves provided,” Daniel Salehi from the Swedish Migration Agency told SvD.
When the Migration Agency assessed asylum seekers' ages last year, before it was handed over to Rättsmedicinalverket, it formally increased the age of 17 percent of those whose age was in doubt.
It is unclear why the figure has increased so sharply, said Salehi. ""One reasonable explanation could be that the cases are now quite simply older, after one or one-and-a-half years,"" he told SvD.
The method of medical age assessment consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth, and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists.
The first results of the new age assessments came in May this year, and in those tests -- which were carried out on asylum seekers whose age was in question -- three out of four were found to be older than 18.
However, there has been controversy over the accuracy of these tests and the Rättsmedicinalverket has previously emphasized that no method of medical age assessment can determine a precise age.
The results of these checks don't give a picture of how accurate the given age of all asylum seekers in Sweden is, as the checks have only been carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the person's given age.

There are several reasons why the age of those who arrive in Sweden might be unclear. Many of the asylum seekers who have arrived in Sweden in the past few years lack identity documents, with many coming from unstable regions where they may have lost many of their belongings. Another factor is that their countries of origin often do not have the same structures in place to record birthdates as Sweden does, so it's not unusual for people not to know their exact age.
This can cause problems because there are differences in how adults and unaccompanied minors are processed; for example, the latter may only be returned to their home countries if they have a family member or other guardian who can provide them with somewhere to live.
The Migration Agency makes an initial age assessment with every application, and people who are not clearly aged over 18 are registered as children.
However, these tests were criticized as ineffective and several Swedish municipalities reported suspected cases of adults who could be as old as 40 being placed together with children at residential care homes for young people (known as HVB homes), as well as being sent to school with minors.
As a result, in September last year the government asked for medical age assessments to be carried out on a large scale.
More than 80,000 minors (of whom 37,000 arrived in the country without a parent or guardian) applied for asylum in Sweden in 2015 and 2016. Medical age assessments are carried out only in cases where the Migration Agency believes there is reason to doubt their age.

					07:27 CET+01:00				", The Local,What's it like being homeless during Sweden's winter?,"It's dropped to less than -5C every night this week in Stockholm. So how does the city's homeless population survive?
Amayd, a Nigerian mechanic, Thomas, a Swedish former bus driver, and Zina, a Roma magazine vendor, have only one thing in common: struggling to find a place to sleep in Stockholm.
“It's hellfire,” says Amayd, describing his life on the streets. A short man with a slow gait, grey-speckled beard, and blood-laced eyes, he is a 42-year-old father from Nigeria. After 13 years as a permanent resident in Spain, he arrived in Stockholm two weeks ago, in search of work.
Every night, he's entered the lottery for a bed at a Salvation Army-run centre with success. But on Sunday, his name wasn't drawn – and so he had nowhere to sleep. He stayed in Stockholm's Central Station until it closed, then spent the night walking through snow-blown streets.
“I only have one coat,” Amayd told The Local. “I was afraid to die of the cold.”
The Nigerian's story is extreme. While he's one of at least 2000 people formally defined as homeless in Stockholm, the city categorizes homelessness on a spectrum that extends to those living in government-assisted apartments. It also boasts a unique “roof over your head” guarantee ensuring that no Swedish resident has to sleep outside.
As a migrant from elsewhere in the European Union though, Amayd doesn't fall on to this Scandinavian welfare net. His case is an example of how Stockholm's homeless population is starkly divided between Swedish citizens and permanent residents versus EU migrants. Although all these groups share similar needs, registered citizens and residents receive social services, but unregistered migrants aren't entitled to government benefits.
“If you're not registered and you don't have any money, we'll give you economic help and shelter,” said Lena Svärd, director of the city's emergency homeless reception. “You can stay here for three months, but if you don't find a job or nothing happens after that, we can't help you and you can't stay.”

While Stockholm's social services fund non-profit organisations to help temporary migrants, they focus on tackling Swedish homelessness.
The capital's unit for the homeless helped 1475 clients in 2015, most of whom were Swedish males aged between 45 and 65. For those with dire need, the city runs six shelters with space for 207 clients.
Social workers like Swärd attribute homelessness among native Swedes to three main causes: lack of housing, substance abuse, and mental health. To address the first cause, Swärd and her team try to get clients into a permanent place – a tough job in Stockholm's notoriously competitive housing market.
“It's difficult to get an apartment, and if you have problems, it's difficult to stay if you don't get support,” she said. “If clients get good support, around 90 percent can stay in their apartments. If they live there for one year and everything works out fine, they get the contract for themselves.”
46 percent of the clients who left Swärd's unit last year now live in their own place. But Bodil Nilsson, director of the Salvation Army's drop-in centre for homeless Swedes, said she doubted whether this would solve their core issues.
“Our guests are living on the edge of society,” said Nilsson. “Many of them have a place to stay, and some have their own contract, but that doesn't mean they're happy. Getting their own apartment is not the solution, and they can lose it because of old habits.”
Such ""old habits"" are drug and alcohol addictions and mental health problems that estrange clients from their families and hinder individuals from keeping jobs.
Thomas Ljungberg, a self-depreciating but good-humored 50-year-old with sparse ginger hair, shared his story as he commandeered a table with two friends at the Salvation Army on Monday morning. He's been unemployed and homeless because of mental illness since 1997.
“I experienced traumatic things in the past that I couldn't process, and it broke my mental health,” he explained. “I worked as a bus driver for seven years, it was the best job I ever had, but my brain was overloaded. When I get tired, I can't control myself, and I didn't want to have a busload of people behind me, so I chose to stop because I was broken down mentally.”
For 13 years, Thomas slept in temporary shelters until getting his own apartment, supported by the government, five years ago. He now regularly sees a psychiatrist.
“I don't think of it as helpful, but I guess it is,” he said. “Four years ago, I was like a walking zombie; I could have never sat here and had a conversation.”
Whatever the cause of homelessness, many of those affected simply need help navigating their way through the complicated social system.
Nilsson explained: “They come to us because they lack the ability to take responsibility, or they're away from the system and they don't have the strength or energy or knowledge to get back. Often they want help, but they've been in the situation for so long, they say there's no point. It takes a lot of courage to turn your life around.”
“But it's possible,” Swärd added. “The city is expanding every day, but we have fewer homeless people.”
While homelessness among Swedes has steadily decreased over the past decade, the number of homeless EU migrants has however skyrocketed.
“In the past four to five years, it's got worse,” said Björn Taikon, a Roma who grew up in Sweden and has 25 years experience working with the municipality. “More people are coming because all of Europe is closed,” he says, musing on tougher immigration lines being taken by many of Sweden's neighbours.
Social services estimate there are now between 600 to 1000 EU migrants without regular income or proper housing in Stockholm. 40 per cent are Roma, many of whom describe themselves as gypsies.
“It's very difficult to work with this population, because the long-term solution is in their home country,” said Åsa Lindhagen, Stockholm's vice-mayor for social affairs. “It's a shame and tragedy that we haven't succeeded better in Europe to distribute the wealth to everyone. So we have to do everything we can to make it easier for their stay here, especially during winter.”
“When we found out that people were sleeping on the streets and it was very cold, the city offered shelters,” explained Swärd, “so that people won't die.”

In November 2014, the city began funding non-profit organisations, including the City Mission, Salvation Army, and Philadelphia Church, to provide shelter during winter nights.
Taikon and his colleague Moise Besokadap, also a Romani who grew up in Stockholm, took up the project. Nearly every day since then, the pair gather at designated times in central locations throughout the city.
Within minutes of the two men entering Stockholm's Central Station last weekend, bearded men in parkas and dark-braided women in swishing skirts flocked to them, warmly greeting the two in the Romani language. Besokadap took each person's ID card and wrote down his or her name and personal number. It's his job to assign them to a bed in one of the four night shelters on a first come, first served, basis.

“There are always too many people, but we try and find them other shelters,” Besokadap said. The only exception is if the temperature is below -7C, when churches open their doors for people to stay without registering.
On Tuesday night, the temperature hovered around the limit. Thick snowflakes swirled in streetlamps as a group of Roma trudged past deserted warehouses in the shadow of the Globe Arena to the city's largest EU migrant shelter.
At 9pm, the doors opened. A volunteer checked each guest's number, then took their 10 kronor ($1.17) entrance fee. Once registered, guests can stay five nights – then they must re-register, find a new place, or enter the lottery for one of the free beds.
Upstairs, volunteers dished out mounds of food and served steaming cups of coffee or tea, and after eating, the guests settled into their bunk beds, took showers, started a game of chess, or showed off pictures of their children.
One married couple Gratian, 24 and Zina, 26, left their two children in Romania with Gratian's mother to come to Sweden four months ago.
“It's much better,” Zina said with a vivacious smile. “We get work here and our family gets food on the table.”

Gratian has found sporadic temporary jobs while she cleans, sells magazines, or recycles cans.
Without language skills and permanent residency, though, they've struggled to find permanent work, and they asked Besokadap for help to find better jobs.
“They trust us because we're family,” said the social worker. “They don't trust the government, they think they want to do something to them or take something from them, but they trust us because no gypsy would want to hurt another gypsy.”
Downstairs, registration was complete, but two men still waited outside the front door, hoping there were empty beds left. There were not.
A volunteer told them to try another one of the shelters, explaining the location and pointing them in the right direction. The two men turned back into the dark, snowy night, hoping they'd get lucky elsewhere.
Stockholm seems to be working hard to ensure that people aren't left out in the cold. But as the city's homeless population changes shape, debates about how to handle the situation are just starting to heat up.

					23:27 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Migrants trying to reach UK from Gothenburg,"Sweden's largest port is becoming a gateway for migrants who are hoping to reach the UK as stowaways by making risky journeys on cargo ships.
Rising numbers of migrants have been found hiding in Gothenburg harbour this summer, according to port authorities.
Officials have told Swedish media that while staff have long been used to discovering stowaways trying to get into the Nordic country from cargo ships, in 2015 the practice seems to have been replaced by a trend in the opposite direction, with migrants desperate to sail away from the biggest port in the Nordics on vessels heading to the UK.
“They are taking big risks, we are afraid that someone will die,” the port's security chief Thomas Fransson told Swedish newswire TT on Thursday.
“It's a very big problem, we are not prepared for this,” he added.
According to Fransson, most of the new wave of secret sailors are from Albania and sneak into the high security harbour in Gothenburg by hiding in cargo boxes, truck trailers and even lorry wheel arches.
“We have electric fences, video surveillance and alarm systems. Dogs are also effective. But we have more than 4000 vehicles coming in and out of the port every day and we cannot search them all,” he told TT.
He said that more than 40 people had been arrested since May after their attempts at hiding in the port were foiled, but said it was unclear how many migrants had successfully made the journey to the UK.
“These are people who are desperate. They are looking for a new future and a better life, and are willing to take big risks. It his already the case that people have been injured,” said Fransson.
Patrik Engström, head of Sweden's national border police, told TT that officers were also aware that growing numbers of Albanians were trying to reach the UK from Sweden.
“The whole of Europe has seen an increase in migration from Albania. Britain has the reputation that it's easy to get a job and stay there, in the big cities. But the UK is not in the Schengen area, and requires visas for Albanians,” he said.
Sweden, which has a global reputation for openness and tolerance, took in thousands of refugees from the Balkans in the 1990s and has remained a popular destination for migrants in recent years.
But a long backlog of cases has left many immigrants waiting months to have their applications processed and there are signs that some nationalities are starting to avoid the Scandinavian country as a result of the bureaucracy and because of the rise of the nationalist Sweden Democrat party, which is currently leading the polls in the Nordic nation.
Albania is a former communist state with a largely muslim population. It applied for EU membership in 2009, but this has yet to be granted."

At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, the EU's migrant commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said it will not allow the Nordic country to extend its border controls between Sweden and Denmark.
“There won't be an extension. The border controls are coming to an end in two months. The prerequisites for granting [the extensions] don't exist anymore.”
During the height of Europe's migrant crisis, Sweden was, along with Denmark, Germany, Austria and Norway, granted an exception from the Schengen free movement clause due to the huge influx of asylum-seeking migrants.

The border controls at ports in the south of Sweden and on the Swedish side of the Öresund Bridge to Denmark were brought in during the winter of 2015, a year where Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum applications.
The measures in the passport-free Schengen zone were only supposed to be temporary and originally designed to last six months, but they were extended by a further half a year in May 2016, then three months more the following November.
According to EU rules, the extension can only be granted three times, and the last one is due to expire on November 12th.
The controls have been unpopular among commuters in the south of Sweden and in the Copenhagen region in Denmark, who have complained that they make journeys across the Öresund Bridge more time consuming."

The migrant crisis in the Mediterranean has seen Europe's politicians – including in Sweden – advocate action to put an end to people trafficking rings believed to be operating in the region.
In a report in May, Swedish police revealed that around 40 of these criminal networks were suspected of using Swedish passport in the human trade.
“There are several cases where we think that the smuggling is being organized from here,” Lars Öjelind, head of intelligence at the Swedish police's national operative department, told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter (DN) on Tuesday.
But despite the rise in suspected smuggling offences, few cases end up in court.
“These are very complex stories where nobody wants to cooperate with us. When the smugglers have already reached Sweden it is very hard to prove that a crime has been committed,” said Öjelind.
But Göran Larsson, police inspector in the Västra Götaland region and former head of a human smuggler action group, issued sharp criticism on Tuesday.
“People smuggling has of course risen at the speed of increasing illegal immigration. The smugglers are allowed to operate freely and that constitutes professional misconduct by the police,” he told DN.
In 2008 and 2009, 56 and 20 cases in which organized people smuggling was suspected led to prosecution.
“Of course this kind of thing costs money, but we hit the cartels [back then] and that saves money for society,” said Larsson.
Öjelind confirms that fewer resources are put towards fighting human smugglers today, but told DN that more needs to be done on an international scale.
“It is not true that we don't take the question seriously. We do a lot of international work, getting to [the smugglers] on our own in Sweden is near impossible,” he said.
The crisis in the Mediterranean has seen Sweden take in a bigger share of asylum seekers than any other EU member state, when compared to existing population size.
Around 9.7 million people live in the Nordic nation and asylum was granted to more than 33,000 refugees last year. Many make it to Sweden by completely legal means, but some are believed to be the victims of human smugglers.
The country's open approach to immigration remains a hot topic, with centre-right opposition parties mooting the idea of moving towards much-criticized temporary residency permits rather than permanent asylum."

					14:50 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Wildfires and migrants: the issues defining the Swedish election,"OPINION: Anamaria Dutceac Segesten, senior lecturer in European studies at Lund University, examines the issues grabbing headlines ahead of the Swedish election.
Sweden is heading for a general election on September 9, with two pressing political issues driving the agenda. But a third, simmering problem could yet define the next parliament.
More than 50 wildfires raged across Sweden during the summer of 2018 – the warmest summer since 1756. So severe was the problem that the Swedish government had to request help from the EU. The gravity of the situation brought environmental questions to the fore, as the effects of climate change became more tangible than ever.
All this has provided new impetus to the struggling Green Party which had looked unlikely to secure the four percent of votes needed to secure seats in the national parliament but now looks likely to reach that threshold. A similar turnaround took place in the 1988 election, when a sudden outbreak of seal pest, a contagious disease that kills the young of the species, helped the Greens enter the Riksdag for the first time.

But the event most defining these elections is the refugee crisis.
In the autumn of 2015, Sweden opened its doors to asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere, taking in more than 100,000 people over a period of just a few months. Managing the influx of people proved difficult and the Social Democrat/Green coalition government had to introduce a much stricter version of its asylum policy as a result.
This effectively closed down Sweden's southern border with Denmark and temporarily suspended the Schengen agreement, which allows free movement through continental Europe. The switch from an open-door policy to a very restrictive approach to asylum, and the poor way in which new arrivals were managed cast a shadow of doubt over the competence of prime minister Stefan Löfven. His Social Democratic Party is now likely to see a significant drop in voter support.
The refugee crisis has had a major impact on Swedish politics. The Sweden Democrats, a staunchly anti-immigration party, has thrived on migration becoming a major concern for many citizens. Current polls show that the party is projected to win about 20 percent of the vote – its best ever result by a significant margin.

However, the crisis has had a far broader affect on political discourse. In February 2013, Tobias Billström, then immigration minister for the Conservative Party, was reprimanded by his party leader for proposing capping the number of non-EU citizens allowed to residency in Sweden. Today, the same Conservative Party, under the new leadership of Ulf Kristersson, has not shied away from proposing a very similar policy.
The refugee crisis has normalized the topic of immigration management, which has affected the agendas of every political party running in this election. All have been forced to take a position on the subject, which has, in turn, made it a deeply polarizing topic.
The political field has been divided into those who are in favour of a more generous immigration approach (Social Democrats, the Left, the Greens and the Centre Party) and those who prefer a stricter policy (the Conservatives, the Christian Democrats, the Sweden Democrats and to some extent, the Liberals). Disagreements over immigration may even lead to a split within the centre-right Alliance that held power in two consecutive governments (2006-2010 and 2010-2014), with the Centre Party defecting from the group position to embrace a more restrictive immigration approach.
While the event of the refugee crisis was the spark that ignited the recent debate on immigration, the topic is connected to longer-term transformations in Swedish society. Political parties are also seeking answers to the difficulties caused by an ageing population, synonymous with a large number of retirees and high demand on the healthcare and elderly-care systems.
Integrating non-EU migrants into the labour market has been a slow process. And, if you add into the mix the generous welfare benefits traditionally provided by the Swedish state (long parental leave, free education at all levels, subsidised healthcare), the dilemma faced by Swedish politicians is evident. The biggest issue of this (and coming) elections will really be the future of the welfare state. Parties must either find creative solutions to finance public services – or propose cutting some of them.

					18:07 CEST+02:00				",TT/The Local,Swedish police defend actions after church migrants raid,"Police in Sweden have defended their actions after a raid on a church activity attended by undocumented migrants and refugees, saying that there is no such thing as protected zones.
Five out of six of the families attending the church-organised activity were taken into custody following the raid, reports news agency TT.
“There are no protected zones according to Swedish law,” police spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford told TT.
On Friday, a family camp for refugees organised by the Swedish church was held at a youth hostel in northern Skåne. The activity was interrupted by a police patrol of around 30 officers, who arrived without warning the church.
One of the families taken in by police – including children aged four and 11 – remains in police custody, according to the Sydsvenskan newspaper.
The Church has criticised the police action, saying that warning should have been given and that the church should be respected as a place of safety.
But Westford dismissed the criticism, pointing out that a number of the people identified during the raid are listed for deportation.
“There are no protected zones according to Swedish law. Apart from embassies, there are no protected zones,” she said.
“Our operation did not take place at a church but at another place,” she added.
The church has expressed its concern that its ability to help those in need will be diminished if it is not seen as a sanctuary, according to the report.

					07:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,'Political participation of migrants in Sweden is important for the quality of democracy',"OPINION: Sweden's democracy is very inclusive – but it relies on people using their right to participate, write Adina Trunk and Lina Antara of Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA).
When we arrive home, the steady flow of letters, supermarket ads, bills and newspapers, maybe even a postcard, are a familiar sight. These days, this pile of post is likely to contain a golden ticket to a recurrent event that sometimes gets easily forgotten. This little white, blue and yellow envelope, contains a voting card, and while this is not news to most Swedes, for new Swedish residents it is often a surprising, memorable moment, linked to the virtues of a democracy of their new home, all wrapped up in a letter.
The cornerstone of democracy is undoubtedly voting. For those born and raised in a democracy, voting constitutes a natural right and responsibility. For those who've never lived in one, it's often an aspiration or a dream. At election time, Sweden stands out as one of the most inclusive countries in the world.
Here, non-Swedish citizens have the right to both vote and stand as candidates in the regional and municipal elections (but not national elections) if they have legally resided in Sweden for a continuous period of three years. Citizens from other EU countries gain these rights as soon as they are registered in the Swedish population register. The result of this is a great impact politics on the local level. Research from International IDEA shows that in particular, the political participation of migrants and refugees in Sweden is important for (increasing) the quality of democracy.
Today, approximately 50 countries around the world – ranging from Chile to South Korea, New Zealand and the Netherlands – allow migrants to participate in elections after a certain period of residence. Granting voting rights to migrants is often a controversial issue, given that voting is traditionally linked to citizenship. In the majority of host countries, only certain categories of voters, such as citizens from EU member states, are entitled to vote and usually only in local elections.
Sweden stands out in that regard given that it has granted voting rights since the 70s to all migrants with three years of residency, regardless of their country of origin.

Through these measures, Swedish authorities wanted to enhance the participation and political inclusion of migrants and raise the perception that their voice also mattered. Indeed, recent research by International IDEA has found that voting is an important means of integrating into a host society, educating migrants about their civic responsibilities and preparing future active citizens. It also provides migrants with incentives to learn more about the democratic norms of the host society and motivates them to strengthen their knowledge of the host country's political system.
Ultimately, political rights can contribute to an increased feeling of belonging and acceptance. Thus, political rights should not only be seen as an end goal, or a reward for successful integration, but as a means in itself. As illustrated in International IDEA's Global State of Democracy report, host countries with inclusive migration policies such as Sweden, are more likely to have a higher quality of democracy, especially when it comes to the aspects of representative government and fundamental rights.
Some Swedish institutions have taken concrete steps to link theory to practice. To ensure that all eligible voters are aware of the electoral process, migrant voters are targeted through the use of minority languages in voter information campaigns. For instance, in view of the upcoming elections, the Swedish Election Authority provides information on how to vote into 31 languages, including Arabic and Somali.
Furthermore, any legal resident, including migrants, can join any Swedish political party of their choice, paying just a membership fee. Party membership can be requested through online forms or by visiting the nearest party office in the area. In certain cases, political parties have even adopted voluntary quotas for candidates with non-Nordic immigrant background, with the view to increasing internal diversity and addressing the issue of migrants' underrepresentation in political life.
Ultimately democracy relies on people, citizens or residents to actively take part in the democratic processes. Whether it's through political party engagement, civil society involvement, debates, articles, manifestations or voting, we all have the responsibility to engage.
The elections this Sunday are just one important way to contribute, and for many it can be a first important step to integration that started when they found that small, white, blue and yellow envelope waiting for them at home.

					13:30 CET+01:00				", The Local,Sweden needs to do more to crack down on hate crimes: report,"Sweden has made strides in combatting xenophobia and segregation, but needs to do more to crack down on hate crimes, the Council of Europe's top human rights body says.
The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) on Tuesday released its fifth report on Sweden where it analyzed the country's integration policies and its efforts to combat issues like racism, xenophobia and homophobia.
In the five years since the ECRI issued its last report on the tiny Nordic nation, it said Sweden had done a good job when it came to setting up government programmes aimed at combatting racism and xenophobia and integrating its big migrant population on the labour and housing market.
However, it noted the country still has some way to go when it comes to clamping down on hate crimes. The main groups targeted are migrants, Muslims, black persons and Roma, it said.
""Some legal deficiencies remain,"" it stated, pointing for example to the lack of legislation covering ""the public denial, trivialization, justification or condoning of genocide and crimes against humanity"".
""Anti-Semitic hatred remains a problem, and the clearance rate of hate crimes remains low.""
IN DEPTH: Breaking down Sweden's anti-Semitism problem
The body also noted that Sweden has still not criminalized neither the creation nor support of groups promoting racism.
The ECRI said the Swedish authorities ""should take further action on awareness-raising and prevention modules covering anti-Semitism and homo/transphobia in the introduction courses for newly-arrived migrants in a way that avoids stigmatization of participants"".
Although it applauded Sweden's state efforts to integrate migrants in the labour and housing market, it said there is still room for improvement.
""In spite of the authorities' considerable efforts in the area of the Introduction Programme for refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the labour market participation rate following completion stood only at 27 percent in 2016, and was even lower for women at just 15 percent,"" it said.
It also said authorities should include concrete, targeted and measurable actions to combat ethnic residential segregation.
Finally, it said that Sweden's ombudsman institutions should have ""adequate powers and expertise to investigate discrimination by all public authorities, including law enforcement agencies""."

The Social Democrat leader said on Thursday that he was willing to answer any call for from help from Frontex, the EU agency that manages cooperation between national border guards to try and protect the 28 member bloc from illegal immigration and human trafficking.
His comments came ahead of an emergency EU summit taking place on Thursday. Country leaders have scheduled the meeting after it was revealed that around 800 victims, including an unknown number of children, died in hellish circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.
The migrants had been locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre boat, according to survivors, which capsized when it collided with a Portuguese vessel.
UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said on Wednesday that the incident had occurred due to a ""monumental failure of compassion"" by the continent's rulers.
Meanwhile the head of the UN's maritime agency has warned that the number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean could surge to 500,000 this year, with deaths at sea reaching thousands if no action is taken against the people who traffic them.

While she said there had been “a glimmer of hope” this week as European governments had called for action, McGowan remained cautious of leaders’ willingness to act.
“The record over the past year and a half has been a cause for concern, there have been emotional statements but there hasn’t been action. Thursday is going to be the litmus test on the EU saving lives,” she said.
Sweden has previously sent planes and ships to the Mediterranean to help spot migrant boats.
The coast guard took part in Mediterranean operations in 2009, 2010 and 2013 and has contributed twice to the EU's anti-pirate mission off Somalia."

					09:36 CET+01:00				",TT/AFP/The Local,Swedish lawyers condemn EU-Turkey migrants deal ,"Swedish group Lawyers Without Borders has expressed concern over the legailty of the deal reached between the EU and Turkey designed to curb migration to the 28-member bloc.
""Asylum seekers have a fundamental right to have their individual asylum claims reviewed in a safe country. Under this agreement there is a genuine risk that people will be denied the right to an individual assessment because it treats all refugees under a mass agreement,"" Louise Gunvén, lawyer and board member of Lawyers Without Borders told Swedish news agency, TT.
Asylum law prohibits return to a country that is unsafe, where people risk being subjected to inhumane or degrading treatment or torture.
""Our extensive experience of Turkey is that people risk being exposed to such treatment. Considerable failings exist in the Turkish legal system, as well as the risk of not getting a fair trial,"" Gunvén said.
The deal also drew criticism from John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Director for Europe and Central Asia, who said promises by the EU to respect international and European law ""appear suspiciously like sugar-coating the cyanide pill that refugee protection in Europe has just been forced to swallow"".
EU leaders approved a controversial deal with Turkey on Friday to curb the huge flow of asylum seekers to Europe, with all migrants arriving in Greece from Sunday to be sent back.
The 28 EU leaders approved the deal which was negotiated with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in a bid to end an unprecedented crisis dividing the continent.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka confirmed that the expulsion of migrants arriving on the Greek islands would begin on Sunday.
""Deal with Turkey approved. All illegal migrants who reach Greece from Turkey as of March 20 will be returned!"" Sobotka wrote on Twitter.
But the deal comes at a heavy cost for Europe, with many members of the bloc expressing misgivings about the legality of the deal and Turkey's human rights record.
Turkey has demanded an acceleration of its long-stalled bid for EU membership, the doubling of refugee aid to six billion euros ($6.8 billion) and visa-free travel in return for taking back all new irregular migrants coming to Greece, the main entry point to Europe.
Davutoglu is now set to formally sign off on the accord at a final meeting with EU leaders.
However, in a sign of the tensions that remain between Ankara and Brussels, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blasted several EU states for taking only a ""handful of refugees"" in contrast to the nearly three million Turkey has admitted, most of them fleeing the Syrian war.
Erdogan also accused the Europeans of supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) days after a bombing in Ankara claimed by Kurdish rebels allegedly linked to the group.
""European countries are paying no attention, as if they are dancing in a minefield,"" he said.
Critics have said the mass expulsion planned under the EU-Turkey deal could infringe international law on the treatment of asylum seekers.
Under the terms of the plan, the EU would take in one Syrian refugee from Turkish soil in exchange for every Syrian readmitted to Turkey from Greece.
The move is meant to discourage them from risking their lives in often rickety and overcrowded boats operated by smugglers.
EU officials insisted the deal would be stressed repeatedly each application would be treated individually, with full rights of appeal and proper oversight.
EU sources said last-minute sticking points were cleared up over the deal's legality, Turkey's membership bid, the date for launching the agreement and a plan to double the amount of aid to Turkey to six billion euros ($6.8 billion).
Another major hurdle that was overcome was opposition from Cyprus, rooted in long-standing tensions with Turkey over Ankara's refusal to recognise its government on the divided island.
More than 1.2 million migrants have come to Europe since January 2015 in the continent's biggest migration crisis since World War II, and around 4,000 have drowned while trying to cross the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece."

					15:37 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Debunk: No, Sweden isn't cancelling a Christmas concert because of migrants","Several international far-right websites claimed that a Swedish Christmas concert had been cancelled in order to avoid offending Muslim migrants. In fact, the cause was a delay on budget and logistics planning from the company behind the event. The Local explores how the story got misrepresented.
The O Helga Natt (Oh, Holy Night) event in Örebro, central Sweden, is the country's biggest open air Christmas concert. It has been held since 2001 and broadcast on TV for ten years, but won't be broadcast this year and it's unclear if it will be held at all.
One extremist far-right website reported that the disruption to the event was ""likely"" to be an example of ""Swedish traditions being suppressed in order not to offend migrants who don't hold Christian beliefs"", without providing any evidence for this claim.
The column was written under the name 'Emma R' and published on the alt-right website Voice of Europe, before spreading to other far-right sites including the Geller Report and on the alt-right Peter Sweden Twitter account.
It cited SVT Nyheter Örebro, which published a short article last week about the decision not to broadcast the concert. The article stated that it was unclear whether the event itself would still take place, contrary to Voice of Europe's article which stated the concert had already been ""cancelled"".
""TV4 is not broadcasting O Helga Natt this year,"" executive producer Karin Dofs confirmed to The Local in a written comment. ""Because it isn't certain that the concert will be staged, we cannot plan for a TV broadcast either.""
""It is sad that we're losing such a great and long-standing Christmas tradition, but we hope to be able to show O Helga Natt next year again,"" Dofs added.
""We deal with untrue news being spread by answering questions we get with transparency. The reason why we decided not to broadcast the event is that there are uncertainties about whether the event will actually take place. These uncertainties have nothing to do with the untruths that have appeared in various forums,"" she said, when asked how TV4 reacted to the false reports.
READ ALSO: How a minor traffic incident was reported as 'horror' by international media
As for the uncertainty over whether the concert will take place, there are a few contributing factors, none of them apparently relating to religion. Firstly, it's important to note that the concert has not been cancelled by ""Sweden"", as stated on the far-right sites, but rather removed from the programming schedule of one TV channel, TV4.
In September, Örebrokompaniet – the marketing company for Örebro municipality – announced that it was withdrawing its offer to be a partner of the event and its support of 900,000 kronor. The reason given was that the company organizing the event, Ambitiös, had failed to put forward a detailed budget or event plan.
""We are not able to wait any longer for information because we need to move on in our planning before Christmas. We are commissioned by the municipality of Örebro to conduct a larger event for Örebro residents over Christmas and so we need to have enough time to find ways to use these resources in another way. Therefore, we are now withdrawing the offer,"" Christer Wilén, CEO of Örebrokompaniet, said in a statement in late September, adding that it was up to Ambitiös, the event's organizers, to let residents know if the event would go ahead. The Local has contacted Wilén for comment.
Ambitiös took over organization of O Helga Natt after the company previously responsible went bankrupt in 2016, and was acquired by Ambitiös. Davor Dundic, CEO and owner of the latter company, said the strong brand and popularity of O Helga Natt was one of the main reasons for the acquisition, and Dundic was earlier this year nominated for an award as 'Örebro resident of the year' for his role in rescuing the free concert.
When The Local contacted Ambitiös, we were told no one in the office was available to speak about O Helga Natt and to send an email, which at the time of publication had not received a response. The website for the concert has not been updated since February 2018, and still lists the details for the 2017 event, while several long-term past collaborators, including a producer and director, told SVT that they have also been unable to find up-to-date information on the event's status.

In fact, Örebrokompaniet has said it still plans to spend the money it had allocated to O Helga Natt on another large-scale Christmas event for the community.
The Netherlands-based website describes itself as a ""conservative news network"" but most articles have a strong anti-migrant and anti-Islam bias.
The article about O Helga Natt concluded with a statement calling on readers to ""start speaking up and to stop accepting the destruction of our culture, counties (sic) and continent NOW"", in a thinly veiled attempt to appeal to far-right, anti-immigration or anti-Muslim sympathizers.

— Christian Christensen (@ChrChristensen) October 16, 2018
It's not the first time that Sweden's local Christmas festivities have been falsely reported abroad.
In 2016, extremist fake news rights reported that the Scandinavian country had issued a ban on Christmas lights for religious reasons and particularly to avoid offending Muslims. The reports came as a surprise to anyone who was actually in Christmas for the festive season, where cities and towns were covered, as usual, in sparkly lights and other festive decorations.
As with the O Helga Natt reports, that story started with a grain of truth. Transport administration Trafikverket had announced that councils wishing to hang lights on state-owned lampposts had to apply for permission, both for legal and health safety reasons."

While Saudi laws call for migrant workers to as far as possible be replaced by nationals, SwedWatch insisted that Swedish companies have an obligation to ""adequately compensate migrant workers who have to quit their jobs due to the Saudization process.""
Especially shocking, according to the group, is that ""all Swedish-Saudi companies keep the migrant workers' passports"", pointing out that the practice is prohibited by the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.

Sweden's national coordinator for vulnerable EU citizens, Martin Valfridsson, presented the findings of a major government begging inquiry on Monday alongside equality minister Åsa Regnér.
""I don't think [giving money to beggars] is what helps individuals out of deep poverty in the long run. I really believe that the money is more useful with organizations in the countries of origin,"" he said.
Sweden has experienced a surge in EU migrants – mostly part of the Roma community from Romania and Bulgaria – begging on streets around the country in the past year.
""We see that the number of vulnerable EU citizens have increased sharply. It's EU citizens who don't have the right to welfare in Sweden. In 2015 there were up to 5,000 vulnerable EU nationals in Sweden with a small dip after the summer. Of those around 70 are children,"" said Valfridsson.
He also suggested that offering places in schools to children of EU migrants could lead to more vulnerable families bringing their children to Sweden while begging in the Nordic country.
""I don't think we should generally offer schooling to these children,"" he said.

The debate about Roma beggars came to a head at the end of last year, after a controversial migrant shanty camp in Malmö was torn down by police.
Valfridsson further discouraged municipalities from making campsites legally available to Roma travellers.
""That creates new difficulties. Society helps reestablish those slum communities we have worked so frantically to get rid of. The message is that you're allowed to come here, but if you do you must live here legally. Society must have a strict approach to that you're not allowed to settle on someone else's land,"" he said.
He also suggested that the government task Stockholm's county council with coordinating with other local authorities across Sweden to help spread information and assist officials in the work with vulnerable members of the EU migrant community.
The government is next set to consider the findings of the inquiry, which did not propose a change in legislation.
""Since we took office we have worked hard nationally and at EU level to limit and stop begging,"" Regnér told reporters at the press conference."

Interior minister Anders Ygeman told Sweden's Dagens Industri newspaper that he believed that at least 60,000, and possibly as many as 80,000, of the 163,000 who sought asylum in Sweden last year would have their applications rejected, meaning they will be returned either to their home countries or to the European country responsible under EU rules.
“The first step will be to go with voluntary return, and to create the best conditions for that,” Ygeman said. “But if that doesn't work, we will need to have returns backed up by force.”
“I think we will have to see more chartered planes, particularly in the EU-region.”
He said that the Swedish government hoped to strike deals with other EU countries – in particular Germany – over coordinating flights to return asylum seekers.
It is also seeking return agreements with countries such as Afghanistan and Morocco.
But Victor Harju, Ygeman's press secretary, on Thursday told The Local that the headlines were ""a bit exaggerated"".
""Due to the fact that we received so many people in Sweden last year, we have to face the reality that more people will also not fulfil the needs within the asylum programme and will not get a permit to stay,"" he said.
However, immigration lawyer Terfa Nisébini criticised Ygeman's plan, saying that by giving an estimate that roughly half of applications would be rejected, telling Expressen newspaper that it risked influencing the way the Swedish Migration Agency assesses cases.
Swedish opposition parties also questioned whether the government would be able to successfully carry out Ygeman's plan.
""No one has managed it before,"" tweeted Fredrick Federley, an MEP for Sweden's Centre Party. ""Sweden has not succeeded in carrying out deportations for a very long time.""

Of the 58,800 asylum requests handled by Swedish migration authorities last year, 55 percent were accepted. Many of those requests were how ever submitted in 2014, before the large migrant flow began.
The Swedish government admits that there is “a significant risk” that large numbers of rejected asylum seekers will attempt to stay without papers, and intends to hire 1,000 additional border police, and deter businesses from employing those who have had their applications refused.
“There need to be severe consequences for those companies which use illegal labour. If there's a well-developed illegal labour market, that will make the incentive to stay in Sweden stronger,” Ygeman said.
Meanwhile Migration Minister Morgan Johansson said authorities faced a difficult task in deporting such a large number of migrants, but insisted the rejected applicants would have to return home.
""Otherwise we would basically have free immigration and we can't manage that,"" he told news agency TT.
However, 7,590 people who had their asylum applications rejected last year went underground, and for the period 2010-2015 their number totalled 40,345, according to the country's migration agency.

Patrik Engström, head of Sweden's border police, told Dagens Industri that his officers would from now on be working “much more intensively” on returning rejected applicants.
“We need to work much more closely with the Migration Agency. It's at the point where people are passed over from the Agency to the police where many disappear. By the time they hear the decision on their claim, police personnel need to already be in place.”"

In a country where ice hockey reigns supreme, cricket was barely seen here ten years ago. But it has exploded in popularity recently and now boasts 65 teams in towns across Sweden.
""Three or four years ago, we had only 13 clubs in Sweden and the number of players was around 600 or 700,"" said Tariq Zuwak, chairman of the Swedish Cricket Federation.
With four divisions, the federation now counts more than 2,000 players: half have acquired Swedish citizenship, the other half are still waiting. Just a handful of members were born in Sweden.
With the visor of his cap shading his eyes from the sun, his face showing signs of exertion after a match, 18-year-old Saeed Ahmed is one of the recently arrived players.
He began playing cricket as a young boy in his native Afghanistan. Arriving in Sweden in 2015 after a perilous and exhausting journey, signing up with a cricket team was a top priority.
Ahmed hopes to improve his game even further. On this unusually hot spring day in central Stockholm, he needs just 30 minutes to prove to Under-19s coach David Williman that his hard work is paying off.

""It was tough,"" admits Ahmed, originally from Jalalabad in eastern Nangarhar province.
And no wonder: the young Afghan has just played against one of the best known cricket teams in the world: London's Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which holds worldwide responsibility for the sport's rules, known as Laws.
The MCC team is in Sweden to instruct players on the official rules of the game, played by millions of people, predominantly in Britain's former colonies in Asia.
Facing off against the ""Real Madrid of cricket"", as the Swedes jokingly call MCC on the sidelines, they lose the game but have a blast nonetheless.
The number of cricket teams in Sweden has more than quadrupled in just a few years, a rise attributed ""mainly to the global situation in recent years,"" Zuwak said.

Sweden has registered around 400,000 asylum applications since 2012 -- with more than one in eight coming from Afghanistan. That represents one application for every 25 inhabitants in the Scandinavian country, a record in Europe. Sweden saw a peak of 162,000 asylum applications in 2015.
As Sweden grappled with the massive influx, the cricket federation also found itself having to adapt, creating new teams across the country. It also created two new positions, including one dedicated solely to integrating new arrivals into Swedish society.
Playing cricket is a way for the asylum seekers to clear their thoughts and forget the troubles that hang over them while their asylum applications are being processed.
""The youngsters miss their families and are worried about their asylum process. But when they play cricket, there is nothing else on their mind than having fun,"" said federation chairman Zuwak.

It's also a way to avoid being brutally cut off from their roots.
""I've made friends here who also come from Afghanistan,"" said Ahmed, who plays for a team in the suburb of Huddinge, south of Stockholm. The youngster now hopes to take part in the qualifying matches in England in July and August for the Under-19 World Cup.
Meanwhile, Sweden's national squad, coached since May by former Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Wasim, will this summer play for the second time in the qualifiers for the ICC World T20 -- a shorter and more spectacular version of traditional cricket -- with the hopes of playing against the world's best teams in Australia in 2020.

But 52 of those on board are understood to be dead.
The Swedish ship Poseidon rescued 130 people from a rubber dinghy and another 442 people from a wooden boat found drifting off the Libyan coast on Thursday. Fifty-two people were found dead in the hold of the wooden boat.
The number of dead has varied in reports - with initial estimates putting the figure at 40 - and the Swedish coastguard said on Friday that difficult conditions had initially made it hard to get an accurate number.
""It [Poseidon] is due in Palermo around 8:00 pm (1800 GMT) tonight,"" coastguard official Robert Primus told AFP.
""Now they have been able to get into the hold properly and count and there are 52 dead,"" he said.
""The vessel has all the survivors and dead on board, and all of them will be taken off the ship tonight,"" Primus said.

The Swedish vessel was in the area as part of the EU border agency Frontex's search and rescue mission known as Triton.
Poseidon is expected to leave Palermo for Valletta later Thursday, Primus said.
Calm weather this week appears to have encouraged the smugglers to get as many people as possible out to sea, knowing that, in most cases, they will be picked up by Italian or international boats and taken to Italian ports.
More than 110,000 migrants have so far landed at Italian ports this year. A further 160,000-plus have arrived in Greece.
But at least 2,300 migrants have died at sea this year during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers."

The so-called ‘gymnasium law’, which came into force on July 1 offered a fast track to a student residency permit for some 9,000, mostly Afghan, students so they could complete their upper secondary studies.
But two out of Sweden’s four migration courts have refused to accept the law, arguing that it is too poorly framed to be applied, and now Sweden’s Migration Agency is only ruling on those applications under the new law which merit a rejection anyway.
“They find themselves in a new and completely debilitating situation,” said Eva Harnesk, who runs the charity’s telephone support service.
“For three year’s we’ve been observing how uncertainty about their future in Sweden affects these youths. The gymnasium law represented a really big hope for many of them.”

The Migration Court of Appeal is expected to rule on whether the law should stand or be rejected, but no date for the decision has been given.
Of the 197 calls Save the Children has received on its line for immigrants and asylum seekers since July, the overwhelming majority have been about the law.
“Every day feels like a year. It’s a pain to have to wait to long,” Ahmad, one of the youths, told TT.
He said that when he had fled his home in Iran, where he lived as a paperless Afghan migrant, he had little idea of where he was going.
“I knew, like, absolutely nothing about Europe,” he said. “I thought it was like one country.”
Harnesk said that several of the youths were homeless and stuggling to feed themselves during the wait, as they no longer quality for support from Sweden’s social services.
She said there was also “enormous frustration” over the law’s arbitrary cut-off lines, noting that a boy who had to wait 13 months for his first ruling from the Migration Agency was not eligible to apply under the law, but if it had instead taken 15 months, he would have been

					14:55 CET+01:00				",Maddy Savage,'Sex attacks and fascism are not the new Swedish norm',"Sweden may no longer be a beacon of tolerance, but the global media's presenting an exaggerated picture of tensions between locals and refugees, argues The Local's Editor Maddy Savage.
At 6.40am I stepped off a night train at Stockholm's central station after a weekend break in Swedish Lapland.
If you've been reading some of the international media coverage about my adopted city in recent days, you'd be forgiven for thinking I was risking my life.
One British newspaper, The Express, described the station as a ""no-go zone"", overtaken by ""all-male migrant mobs spreading terror"" by groping and robbing passengers and staff.
Meanwhile a writer for US news and opinion site Breitbart declared there was a ""rampant"" lawlessness and a ""now-constant state of violence, terror and fear"".
On Friday night, newspapers, radio stations and television networks all over the world reported on a group of masked far-right demonstrators who appeared to be reacting to this presumed state of chaos. They beat up non-Swedes and vowed to give foreign teenagers living on the streets around Stockholm Central Station the “punishment they deserve”.
So did I feel scared arriving back in the Swedish capital? Absolutely not.
As I headed to catch the blue subway line home, morning commuters were travelling calmly into work, a cleaner was polishing an already glistening white floor and two security guards were strolling slowly out of a newsagent, sipping on their takeaway coffees. The main square outside was empty, save for two Swedish teenagers sharing a cigarette.

Sweden has spawned some alarming headlines lately. A teenager at a centre for unaccompanied refugees near Gothenburg was arrested on suspicion of murdering a 22-year-old woman who worked there. Police admitted covering up reports of multiple sex assaults at a music festival. Dozens of homes for asylum seekers have been set on fire.
However, it is crucial that these news stories are viewed in context. Immigration and integration are becoming increasingly thorny issues in Sweden, and the country's reputation as a beacon for openness and tolerance has taken a battering. But neither sex attacks by migrants nor radical racism are the new norm.

In 2015, as Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers, the number of reported rapes in the Nordic nation actually dropped by 12 percent compared to the previous year, according to figures released by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå) in January. Meanwhile petty thefts dipped by two percent.
As for personal safety around Stockholm's central station, police were unable to immediately provide The Local with the number of reported assaults over the past 12 months. But a press officer, Lars Byström, insisted that tourists and residents alike should not feel under threat.
""Normally Stockholm is not a dangerous place to visit or to take a walk outside in. I think it is rather safe,"" he said.
Asked why one anonymous officer recently told Swedish television that he would not let his own family go near the station, he described his colleague's comments as ""a little bit strange"".
A very unscientific strawpoll of my female friends in Stockholm on Monday revealed that no one had experienced or even heard of other women being groped by refugees in the station in recent months, other than in media reports. But plenty could talk about being felt up by drunk Swedes on a night out.
News stories that hone in on a rise in support for the far-right Sweden also deserve a number of caveats.
Neo-Nazi inspired activity – such as that witnessed on Friday in Stockholm – does appear to be on the rise. Yet a report by Swedish anti-racist foundation Expo last year suggested that membership of fascist organisations in Sweden has fallen.
It is well documented that support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party (SD) shot up in 2015, with 22 percent of people asked by pollsters Novus saying they would pick the party in December. But while for many international newspapers these statistics slot neatly into the theme of a ""lurch to the right"" across Europe, Sweden's unique political climate also needs to be taken into consideration.

Until recently all of Sweden's centre-right opposition parties strongly backed the country's open borders, alongside the Social Democrat-Green coalition government. Voters who were unsure about rising immigration had no one to turn to except for the Sweden Democrats.
Yet in the past few months many of the traditional parties, including the governing Social Democrats and the main opposition Moderates, have adopted stricter policies on asylum and immigration, and support for the country's nationalist party is appearing to stall: SD's following dropped by two percentage points in Novus' latest survey last month.
On Sunday, thousands of Swedes turned to social media to voice their frustration that the party said it was protecting ""Swedish women"" from immigrant attacks when its members handed out flyers in Stockholm over the weekend, with the hashtag #inteerkvinna (#notyourwoman) trending on Twitter.

While surveys suggest the majority of Swedes back their country's decision to tighten asylum rules amid an acute strain on resources, that does not mean that support for helping refugees in principle is waning. Up until last autumn, when local authorities began warning that they could no longer cope with the record influx, surveys were showing very different results.
Growing numbers of Swedish people may now be openly questioning their country's ability to offer accommodation to refugees amid a national housing crisis, or wondering whether politicians will manage to cut rising unemployment among foreign-born residents. However plenty of these voters are the very same people who've given record donations to asylum charities in recent months.
Sweden is feeling the full force of its decision to welcome its highest number of immigants in history in 2015. Opinions are fragmenting. But the country is not broken."

					14:28 CET+01:00				",TT/AFP/The Local,Sweden and Denmark to lift border checks 'soon',"Sweden and Denmark have agreed to lift temporary border checks as soon as possible but must first slow migrant flows, the EU said on Wednesday after emergency talks on Europe's passport-free Schengen zone.
EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos called the meeting after Denmark this week slapped spot checks on its border with Germany, and Sweden imposed its own controls on travellers from Denmark.
""We agreed to keep (the measures) to a minimum and return to normal as soon as possible. This means the flows have to be slowed down,"" Avramopoulos said following the talks in Brussels with officials from Sweden, Denmark and Germany.
""We all agreed that Schengen and free movement must be safeguarded,"" Avramopoulos added.
More than a million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe in 2015 -- many of them fleeing the war in Syria -- in the worst crisis of its kind to face the continent since World War Two.
The EU's cherished passport-free Schengen area has come under huge strain, as many countries have reintroduced border controls to deal with the flow of migrants trying to reach wealthy Germany, Sweden and other countries from the main landing point in Greece.
Schengen rules mean checks can be reintroduced for up to six months.
But Swedish migration minister Morgan Johansson said on Wednesday that the new controls ""should not be put in place longer than we need"".
He said the checks were necessary because his country has taken in more asylum seekers per capita than any other EU nation -- 160,000 asylum requests last year, including 26,000 unaccompanied minors, with 115,000 of them in the last four months.
Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg said they were ""monitoring the situation by the hour"" but added that ""in Denmark we don't wish to be the final destination for thousands and thousands of asylum seekers.""
Støjberg told reporters after the meeting, however, that she informed Avramopoulos that Denmark could implement further measures at its border “if necessary” and with short warning.
German interior ministry official Ole Schroeder said part of the problem was that an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from frontline Greece and Italy to other member states was not working."

					13:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Hiring foreigners 'good for business': study,"Employing foreign workers can mean a boost for businesses in terms of increased trade and competitiveness, a Swedish study has found.
According to the report, published on Tuesday in the Swedish journal Ekonomisk Debatt, a typical Swedish manufacturing company can increase export sales by over 2 million kronor ($300,000) by hiring a foreign-born worker.
The study, which is based on on data from 7,000 Swedish manufacturing companies from over a ten-year period, also found that hiring a foreign-born worker can increase imports by 12 percent.
“Our study indicated that employing people from outside of Sweden can help overcome barriers to trade with countries where that migrant comes from,” said researcher Magnus Lodefalk of Örebro University to The Local.
Just one extra percentage point of diversity in the work place equates to 9 percent higher export sales, the study shows.
“As a result, the foreign worker brings more information for the firm in terms of how to do business with that person's home country, the culture… having more foreign-born workers basically leads to more knowledge.”
Furthermore, Lodefalk explains that the 'migrant' workers provide firms with a larger network within which to trade, as the hiring of a foreign worker opens the doors to connections with relatives, friends, and former school mates in their home country.
“It becomes a valuable way to monitor new markets,” Lodefalk explains.
The results of the study could even be used to fight what Lodefalk refers to as potential discrimination in the workforce.
“If you look at foreign-born people in Sweden versus native Swedes, there can be cases of discrimination in the workplace. There is historically a problem of matching work with the level of education,"" he said.
In terms of whether the results can be used more widely outside the area of manufacturing, Lodefalk explains that the team was researching uncharted territory and that it would be hard to see where things will go from here.
“We were the first to publish a study on this topic at the level of a firm – it's deeper and more serious than other similar studies. Now, we can look deeper into our findings and analyze what the results may mean in a broader context,” he told The Local.

Following the destruction of two camps last year, the lack of suitable shelter has intensified, according to the newspaper.
The principal and janitor of the school now often find themselves starting their day by waking migrants sleeping in tents in the school's yard.
The situation is ""clearly a cause for concern,"" Principal Christina Hagelin told Sydsvenskan.
The school saw an increase in the number of people camping in its yard during the autumn, at first in sleeping bags under the open sky, and then sometimes using tents as the weather got colder, says the report.
A number of students witnessed police asking two people to remove their tents and leave the school yard on Wednesday.
""I think it was a neighbour that called (the police). But this is a recurring concern,"" Hagelin told Sydsvenskan.
""It is tragic that it has to be like this,"" added the principal.
A camp for EU migrants in Malmö's Pildammsparken was torn down in the spring of 2015. A second camp, near Industrigatan in the centre of the city, was also removed in November that year.
Prior to the demolitions, a number of conflicts emerged when residents in the areas around the camps complained about issues such as littering. Groups in support of the EU migrants were also formed.
The city of Malmö has around 40 beds for homeless people.
""There has been much more demand this year than last. We have basically been fully occupied since day one,"" Reverend Andreas Wessmann of the Pingskyrkan church, which provides the overnight accommodation for the homeless, told Sydsvenskan.
Pierre Douhan of Malmö's municipal police confirmed that camping at the school was forbidden, but that the situation was not straightforward to resolve.

A spokesperson for an organization which campaigns for the rights of work permit holders told The Local the group was ""heartbroken"" by the ruling.
Sweden's migration rules have been criticized in the past year for not being flexible enough, including by key industry players such as Spotify, following a number of high-profile cases where tech talents were threatened with deportation due to technicalities.
Sweden's Justice and Migration Minister Morgan Johansson described the situation as ""Kafkaesque"" and the government proposed a change to the law which was expected to come into force by December this year.
But now the country's legislative council, which checks draft bills before they can be submitted to parliament, has rejected the bill proposed by the opposition Alliance coalition, which had been approved by the governing Social Democrats as well as the Green Party and Left Party.
The strict rules currently in place are designed to prevent employers from exploiting migrant workers by giving them poorer working conditions than promised.
The motion aimed to tackle this by introducing a ""principle of proportionality"", allowing case officers to take multiple factors into account when assessing a particular decision, including their job and professional skills, rather than indiscriminately ordering the deportation of all those who were found to have problems with their permits. It also hoped to improve flexibility, giving employers a chance to rectify mistakes before revoking the employee's permit.
But the Council on Legislation argued that the proposals ""would imply a fundamental change to the current system of labor migration"", and advised against their introduction.
Rafiqul Islam from the Work Permit Holders' Association (WPHA) told The Local that the group was “heartbroken” by the decision, after the motion had given them “a bit of hope”.
“The situations of work permit holders are really frustrating. After working in this country for years; foreign workers are being deported over system errors or administrative mistakes. The numbers of deportations are around 400 every month. This motion gave us a bit hope that our problem would be solved in December this year,” Islam said.
He added that following the decision, many of the association’s members had been in touch to ask for advice as it was unclear whether the law would be changed in December as promised.
“It's been over a year that we are being deported, people are living with extreme uncertainty. We can not wait longer. We are here to work, not to deal with this kind of uncertainty that we are not responsible for. We need a policy which will protect foreign workers as soon as possible,” he told The Local.
Under the current system, he emphasized, many workers face deportation “due to system failures, not for our mistakes.”
In July this year, figures showed that more than one hundred tech workers have had their request to stay in Sweden denied in an 18-month period.
One example is Tayyab Shabab, a developer from Pakistan who had his application for a work permit extension rejected despite having a steady job in Sweden because a previous employer forgot to take out occupational pension insurance for him.
And The Local reported on the case of Bangladeshi worker Syed Latif who was deported because he received his job via LinkedIn rather than Sweden's job centre Arbetsförmedlingen.
The decision of the Council on Legislation is advisory and non-binding, and the politicians behind the bill will now be able to address the criticisms raised.

					13:15 CEST+02:00				",Lee Roden,Why Sweden doesn't keep stats on ethnicity and crime,"The subject of immigration is an increasingly charged one, yet much of the discussion is founded on guesswork. To the ire of some, and the agreement of others, Sweden does not collect statistical data on the ethnic background of criminals. The Local's Sweden in Focus series looks at why that is the case, and whether it's likely to change soon.
Contemporary debate about immigration in Sweden often centres on the unusually high influx of refugees in the last decade, which is frequently claimed by the international far right to have sown chaos. Google's data shows that some of the searches connected to ""Sweden immigration"" that have increased most in the last five years are ""Sweden crime rate"" and ""Sweden rape statistics"".
While the domestic debate is more nuanced, migration remains a hot topic in the build-up to the forthcoming autumn general election, and crime in relation to immigration is a particularly big talking point.
It doesn't take much effort to find articles claiming to have the 'truth' about the relationship between immigrants or refugees and Swedish crime. Yet the real truth is that there is no up-to-date public data on the ethnic background of criminals in the country, with existing figures more than a decade old.
There was once a time when Sweden regularly recorded such data on the national origin of those involved in crime, explains Stockholm University criminology professor emeritus Henrik Tham, who specializes in Swedish criminal policy and its history.
""In the 1980s in official statistics there were two tables on people who had been prosecuted, and one of them covered foreign citizens registered in Sweden under the category 'Living in Sweden'. There was a separate part about those not registered in Sweden: everything from students to Danes and Norwegians who came over and sometimes ended up involved in fights, but didn't have residence here,"" Tham tells The Local.
""In 1991 when the centre-right government decided it wanted to get rid of Statistics Sweden (SCB) – which was seen as an expression of social democracy – they moved the responsibility for statistics to different bodies, which meant crime statistics were moved to the National Council on Crime Prevention (Brå). At that point the stats we spoke about earlier disappeared.""
SWEDEN IN FOCUS: An in-depth look at what makes this country tick
Stockholm University professor emeritus Henrik Tham. Photo: Stockholm University
Brå took a different approach to measuring statistics in the area, and instead of publishing regular figures on immigrants and crime opted for more sporadic but in-depth reports on the matter. The first of them, ""Crime among immigrants and their children – a statistical analysis"" (Invandrare och invandrares barns brottslighet – en statistisk analys) covered the period between 1985 and 1989, and was published in 1996. The report met with some controversy, as by the mid-90s attitudes in Sweden had changed.
""The interesting thing is that in several previous instances there were reports written which detailed the matter of crime by foreigners – I was involved in two of them – and at that time there was no opposition. But when the Brå report was published in the 1990s, people asked how long people were going to be treated as immigrants in connection with the stats – two, three, four generations? There was a lot of discussion about that,"" Stockholm University's Tham recalls.
Sensitivity about detailing ethnicity in relation to crime in Sweden only grew as the 90s progressed to the new millennium. Brå's last report on the matter, ""Crime among persons born in Sweden and other countries"" is now more than 10 years old. Stina Holmberg was one of the authors.
""The judgement we made is that looking at the four previous studies we did of roughly the same kind the results were very similar. Immigrants were overrepresented in crime, but the gap was reducing by the generation. Second generations are less over-represented. So we felt that there was no huge value in doing more because the results were pretty stable – what we knew was sufficient for our work,"" Holmberg explains to The Local.
Brå's first study analyzed data up to and including 1989, but significant changes had occurred by the time the 2005 report was compiled – including the arrival of almost 300,000 refugees in Sweden spearheaded by the fall-out from the Yugoslav wars. Immigration in general had also increased, while on top of that came the fallout from the recession in the country during the 1990s which increased segregation.
IN DETAIL: What lessons can Sweden learn from its Yugoslavian refugees?
Brå judged that the results of their new report were stable compared to past editions, despite those significant developments in scale of immigration and the economic situation. The vast majority of immigrants were not registered in connection with crime, but the risk continued to be higher than it was for those born within the country, and was also higher for those who have one or more foreign-born parent.
The 2005 report showed that those born abroad were 2.5 times more likely to be registered as a crime suspect than a Swedish born person with both parents born in the country (up from 2.1 in 1996). For those born in Sweden to two foreign-born parents that number decreased to two times as likely to be registered as a suspect, and for those with one Swedish-born parent it dropped to 1.4.
According to Brå in their report ""if one standardizes in order to take into account differences in relation to age, gender, level of education and income, the relative risk among those born outside Sweden diminishes to 2.1"". In other words, the same level as their first report.
""If the results are more or less the same, what do we do with them? People who are for immigration will say 'there's only slight change because of immigration'. Those who are against it will say 'look, I told you!'. These stats are always used as part of arguments on immigration rather than as a real method of measuring crime,"" Holmberg argues.

Brå's position has been for some time that the 2005 report is still relevant, and that they have already effectively measured the crime-related consequences of periods of high immigration.
Stockholm University's Tham fundamentally agrees that the results of research in the field have been consistent over the years:
""Several studies were done and the results were similar – immigrants were more likely to be involved in crime, but their children were less likely than they were.""
He does however think that the older stats recorded in the era before Brå was tasked with detailing crime were still useful.
""It's a political question more than a research question, but if you look back 25 years, you could argue it's better to have kept the stats we had. I don't think that would have been enough to counter the statements coming from some groups today though, because it was a different discussion about migration then.""
There are however some less talked about consequences of the reluctance to keep data on ethnic background in connection to crime. While much of the contemporary debate focuses on whether immigrants commit crimes or not, what about measuring how they are treated by law enforcement?
In the UK for example, official stats have helped to expose the disproportionate amount of ethnic minorities stopped and searched by police. In Sweden, the lack of official numbers means analysis in that area is a far more difficult task. Criminologist Leandro Schclarek Mulinari, who wrote a report on ethnic profiling by police in Sweden for NGO Civil Rights Defenders, says it's a frustrating situation.
""We lack a lot of stats. When you compare us to the studies in the USA or the UK for example, where there are stats involving ethnicity or race, you can see there clearly what the experience is for someone of a particular race or ethnicity. Those stats speak for themselves – that there's a disproportionate number of people of certain races stopped and searched by the police,"" he tells The Local.
""There are no stats similar to the stop and search stats according to race which exist in the UK. The small studies we have are very limited too. There are around 20 studies since the 1970s looking at whether immigrants are over-represented in crime stats, but when it comes to the other question, about whether they're discriminated against in law enforcement, there's only very small, limited studies. It's a problem that we don't have numbers.""
The researcher thinks an explanation is that discussions on race and racism are not as advanced in Sweden as they are in countries like the UK or US, where mass immigration has been going on for much longer.
""That's to do with history of course – in the UK there has been migration from the Caribbean, for example, decades ago, and the discussion starts way back then. That also informs discussions about institutional racism. In the USA there has been a discussion for a long time too. In Sweden the first scientific study in this area happened in the mid 1990s. It's only 20 years we've been talking about this.""
""There's also this idea that Sweden is an anti-racist country. This self-understanding that racism doesn't exist – that we're colour blind,"" he adds.
But could Sweden's approach to ethnicity and crime statistics be about to change? The current Social Democrat government has said further statistics in the area are not needed. The centre-right opposition Moderate party disagrees, saying studies should be commissioned detailing the ethnic background of perpetrators of sexual crime in particular, in response to an increase in reported rapes in the country as well as an increase in the proportion of people who were victims of sexual assault since 2015.

""The Moderates want to do as broad and comprehensive a study as possible on sexual crime, which has increased markedly in recent years,"" Moderate party secretary Tomas Tobé tells The Local via e-mail.
""That could for example be regarding the age of the perpetrator and their relationship with the victim. It could also be on whether the perpetrator has a foreign background. Such information could be useful for both changing legislation as well as shaping information efforts and other measures aimed at preventing crime. There could be grounds for also looking at other kinds of crime from that perspective.""
Asked about the argument made in some quarters that the stats could be manipulated for populist means, Tobé countered that knowledge is better than no knowledge when it comes to preventing myth-building.
""Not having sufficient knowledge when it comes to these questions is a problem, which risks contributing to false ideas and incorrect action. When it comes to sexual crime, we have called for as broad a mapping as possible in order to maximize knowledge. In addition, more knowledge can also help to prevent populist myth building from spreading – which Brå has previously noted,"" he replies, referring to Brå's justification for carrying out its 2005 study on crime among people born in Sweden and other countries.
It's little surprise that the likes of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats back the Moderate calls for fresh stats on ethnicity and crime, but general opinion also seems to be shifting as it's not only the right who want to see more detailed figures. At their February party conference the Left Party backed the gathering of statistical data on ethnicity as part of anti-discrimination measures. Leading Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter meanwhile, which has a generally liberal stance, published an editorial last year backing the mapping of crime in relation to people with a foreign background.
""'We already know' is a weak argument,"" the editorial contested, adding that it is difficult to tackle problems and come up with adequate countermeasures without the availability of sufficient facts.

Calls for more thorough statistics were again heard after the Aftonbladet tabloid this week published a report on gang rape, finding that out of 112 people found guilty of gang rape in 2012-2017, 82 were born outside of Europe.
Brå's report from 2005 found that people suspected of rape or attempted rape were five times more likely to be foreign-born (however less than 0.3 percent of foreign-born people were suspected of such offences).
And on Tuesday Brå said it would look into whether or not it would re-examine the issue in a new report.
""It can now be established that the public demand for updated information on the relationship between crime and descent and migration is so great that the authority needs to consider the possibilities again,"" it said in a statement to the TT news agency just days after the interviews for The Local's article were conducted.
Brå's reports are planned far in advance and it said it would not make a decision until early next year.
Before Tuesday's statement, Brå's Holmberg told The Local she understood the argument that new numbers are better than no numbers if speculation is to be lessened, but did not necessarily agree with it.
""If the government tasked us with doing that, I'd understand the argument. As a knowledge-based agency, we don't feel like there's a lack of knowledge that's so big as to require us to do it. There are enough valuable studies.""
""I felt that when we worked on it the last time, it didn't improve the quality of discussion in the area compared to the edition before – it was still people in favour of immigration showing it proved their point, or people against saying it proved theirs,"" she adds.
Criminologist Schclarek Mulinari points out that the discussion on future steps should ultimately not only be about producing more stats, but also about how they are framed and acted upon.
""More often than not the questions are framed in a way that's related to being repressive towards immigrants. It's worth remembering that numbers have to be interpreted, and it's also about what kind of political interest there are in using the stats, how those stats are read. Stats are in themselves neutral, they have to be interpreted,"" he emphasizes.
""If you really want to deepen understanding in this area you have to consider what the stats are and also what they're going to be used for. Are they going to be used to better locate people without residence papers, for example? To track down migrants and their kids? Or are they going to be used to improve how the police act, and to create a less discriminatory police? It's very complicated, and more often than not the discussion in the area in Sweden is too simplistic,"" he concludes.

					17:24 CET+01:00				", The Local,Police fail to show at Roma camp in Malmö,"A controversial EU migrant camp in Malmö was due to be torn down at 4pm on Sunday but the eviction deadline passed without any sign of the police.
Despite the no-show from authorities, rumours circulated that the eviction would take place early on Monday morning.
However, Lars Förstell, information director for Skåne police, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, “I don't understand the word 'postpone'. 4pm was simply the earliest we could clear the camp. It is the municipality's business and we will assist them should they require us.”
The migrants have been living in tents, caravans, shacks and cars in an industrial area for months, sparking an intense debate in the city.
According to Radio Sweden (Sveriges Radio) around half of those in the camp, approximately 75 people, had left by 3pm.
But others refused to go and were joined in support by demonstrators outside the camp.
Simona Tegman of the Network for Roma Rights (Nätverket romers rättigheter) told the Swedish news news agency, TT, “We want to have a peaceful demonstration, a sit-down.”
Malmö is offering accommodation for five nights for around 50 people, said local councillor Carina Nilsson. The city is also trying to find help for the migrants in their home villages in Romania.
Last Tuesday, Malmö's environmental committee decided that the camp needed to be emptied and cleaned up and announced that residents had until 4pm today to either leave or face eviction by police.
On Saturday, the Swedish government's national coordinator for vulnerable EU citizens, Martin Valfridsson, told Sveriges Radio that there should be zero tolerance for those who camp on private or public property.
“The state must support the municipalities in a very difficult situation,” Valfridsson said. “Police and private property owners have great difficulty with this situation. I think there should be zero tolerance for those who live without permission on all land in Sweden.”
“You can't give special treatment to any group in society,” he says. “We have no national roof-over-your-head guarantee. In large cities we even evict families with children who can't pay their rent.”
Under Swedish law both locals and visitors alike currently have the right to walk or camp on almost any land, although this does not include public land that is adjacent to residential property or privately-owned gardens.
The case of the camp in Malmö is unique because the person who owns the land tolerated the migrants – who are mainly Roma people from Romania and Bulgaria – for six months before launching a trespassing case with police.
Sweden's national government recently announced it was set to appoint an investigator to review the country's regulatory framework for eviction.
Some municipalities in other parts of Sweden have already evicted groups of Roma from public land including in the capital, Stockholm."

In total, 25,666 people applied for asylum in Sweden in 2017, the lowest figure since 2009, Migration Agency figures show.
This was a decrease of more than 3,000 compared to 2016, and just a seventh of the figure the previous year, when 163,000 people applied for asylum in the Nordic country.
The majority of asylum seekers who arrived last year came from Syria, Iraq, or Eritrea. And the proportion of unaccompanied minors also fell to 1,336.

The data for Sweden is in line with a recorded drop in migration to Europe as a whole. Across the continent, 2017 saw around 183,000 migrant arrivals, according to the International Organization for Migration. This is half the figure of the previous year, and the lowest number in four years.
Since the peak in arrivals in 2015, the agency has reached decisions on 200,000 asylum cases, and it reached its target for 2017 despite reductions in staff numbers announced last autumn. Of those who received their decisions last year, 56 percent had their request for asylum approved.
A significant proportion of the workload in 2017 came from clearing the backlog in asylum applications from unaccompanied minors, and the agency resolved 18,000 such cases, having set itself a target of 17,000.
Decisions in these cases have been slowed down by controversy over the accuracy of ages supplied by some of the asylum seekers, and the introduction last year of medical age assessment tests.
""We managed it thanks to great effort from our employees. I regret the waiting times for those who applied, but we've now broken a negative trend,” Swedish Migration Agency General Director Mikael Ribbenvik said in a statement.
Around 2,600 further applications from unaccompanied minors are still awaiting a decision; in the majority of these cases, the Migration Agency is awaiting the results of medical tests or other paperwork.

					13:47 CET+01:00				", The Local,Öresund train operators mull scanning IDs,"Swedish and Danish train operators are mulling the possibility of scanning the IDs of all travellers crossing the Öresund Bridge. The move is linked to the mandatory ID checks that will be imposed on Sweden-bound trains as of January 4th.
As a result of the recent migrant influx, and in a bid to better control who is crossing into Sweden, authorities are imposing mandatory ID checks on train passengers travelling from Denmark to Sweden in the first week of January. Train operators who fail to carry out the controls risk fines of up to 50,000 kronor (€5,430) for each unchecked passenger.
According to Swedish daily Sydsvenskan, the risk of having to face such steep fines has prompted Swedish and Danish train operators to consider scanning, and registering, passports and other valid IDs of all Sweden-bound passengers. In the case that a passenger would then lose his or her travel documents, train staff would still be able to show that the person has indeed been checked and approved to board the train.
As Europe faces the biggest migrant crisis since World War II, Sweden – a country of just under 10 million – has taken in more than 160,000 asylum seekers and it is weighing heavily on the country's infrastructure. Many of the asylum seekers arrive without appropriate documents, however, making it difficult for authorities to distinguish whether they are really in need of asylum or not.
“There's currently a discussion about how DSB (Danish State Railways) will be able to prove to Swedish authorities that they've really carried out the ID controls,” Gunnar Wulff, CEO of train operator Öresundståg AB, was quoted as saying.
He added, however, that no decision has yet been taken on the subject, but can be expected prior to the new law kicking in.
In November, Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet reported that some 14,000 foreign nationals, some of them wanted by police and ordered deported, had “disappeared” and gone underground. This problem has prompted authorities to step up its efforts, through for example more ID checks, to ensure people without legal right to stay in Sweden to exit the country."

""They were unhappy at the remuneration and wanted to stop picking. But not all. The seventeen who came from south Vietnam wanted to continue to work. It seems that they had been locked up by the north Vietnamese,"" Mats Persson told the newspaper.
Several police units, interpreters and Stockholm embassy staff have been obliged to travel to the small rural community of Branäs in Värmland to mediate in the conflict between the groups of Vietnamese and their employers.
The Vietnamese migrant workers are spending the summer working to pick berries and many have taken out loans on their houses and borrowed money from friends and family in order to make the trip to Sweden.
Around 120 of the workers went out on strike on Tuesday complaining that it was impossible for them to pick sufficient berries to pay for their trip and earn enough money.
""We were told we would be able to pick between 60 and 120 kilogrammes of berries per day. But this is impossible, at best we can manage 10-30 kilogrammes,"" one of the striking workers, Le Thi Hong, told the newspaper.
The workers are employed by Vietnamese recruitment firm TTLC and are organized in Sweden by Rabema service. The workers report that they have forked out up to 15,000 kronor ($2,000) to fund their two month stay in addition to the 9,000 kronor they pay in board and lodging.
In return they have been paid 14 kronor per kilo.
While some of the workers are protesting against the employment conditions it seems that others, keen to work, are directing their ire towards their countrymen.
Groups of south Vietnamese workers have had to move to an alternative, secret location under police escort after refusing to join the strike.
""The north Vietnamese have been so threatening that we can not have them in the same place,"" Svante Vanbert for Rabema explained.
The company has now given the workers an ultimatum - ""work hard, and we will help you to find enough berries, or go home.""
Rabema reported on Thursday evening that five of the striking workers have elected to make the journey home while the other 115 will resume work on Friday."

Åsa Romson used the term “zigenare” following a debate between the leaders of Sweden’s major political parties, broadcast on SVT.
The word, which means “gypsy” in English is deeply offensive. In April it became one of a selection of words followed by the phrase ""använd istället"" (use instead) in the latest edition of Sweden's official dictionary produced by Svenska Akademien (The Swedish Academy). The book advises all Swedes to use “Roma” instead.
But Romson used word term “zigenare” instead of “Roma” as she defended describing the migrant crisis in Europe as “the new Auschwitz” in the broadcast on Sunday night.
After her comparisons with the mass killings proved controversial, she told SVT she wanted to apologize to “any of the groups” affected by Adolf Hitler’s crimes during the second word war including “zigenare” (gypsies), Jews and gay people.
She also said the word “zigenare” during an interview with Sweden’s Expressen newspaper on Sunday.

The leader later told SVT that she was sorry, adding that she had used an expression that “did not fit”, while trying to make a strong argument about the migrant crisis in the EU.
Her press spokesperson Hellström Gefvert later told the broadcaster that Romson had been “tired” after the debate and knew that her choice of words was “indefensible”.
On Monday, Romson issued another apology on Twitter, posting: ""Again: It was wrong to make an Auschwitz analogy. I sincerely apologize"".
Återigen: Det var fel att göra liknelsen om Auschwitz. Jag ber verkligen om ursäkt
— Åsa Romson (@asaromson) May 11, 2015
Sweden's Social Democrat-Green government announced last month that it was going to allocate 13 million kronor a year from 2016-19 to help tackle racism towards Roma people, including increasing understanding of Roma culture and language in Sweden's education and social care sectors.
Romson is not the first Swedish politician to compare Europe's refugee crisis to the Holocaust.
Last month, Liberal Party MEP Cecilia Wikström told The Local that EU member states were currently doing so little to help guarantee safe passage for migrants that future generations would compare their actions to Sweden ""turning a blind eye"" to the Holocaust.
""I think that my children and grandchildren are going to ask why more wasn't done to help people running away from Isis, or violence in Eritrea or wherever, when we knew that people were dying in their thousands. People will ask the same question they did after the war, 'if you were aware, why didn't you do something?'"", she said."

					07:30 CEST+02:00				",TT/AFP/The Local,Were human smugglers on board boat of death?,"Swedish officials suspect that people involved in human smuggling were on board a migrant boat rescued by the coastguard's ship off the Libyan coast in a catastrophe that claimed 52 lives.
Swedish ship Poseidon rescued 130 people from a rubber dinghy and another 442 from a wooden boat found drifting off the Libyan coast on Thursday. Fifty-two people were found dead in the hold of the wooden boat.
The ship reached the port of Palermo at 8.30pm on Thursday. Survivors were taken ashore and transported to a refugee reception centre on Sicily.
The reported number of deaths has varied - with initial estimates putting the figure at 40 - and the Swedish coastguard said that difficult conditions had made it hard to get an accurate number.
“What is left at Poseidon is the ultimate sign of the tragedy: the refrigeration container with the 52 dead,” coastguard spokesperson Mattias Lindholm, travelling with the Poseidon, told the TT news agency late on Thursday.
The bodies were found in the boat's machine room.
“They were more or less locked up in there. The (ventilation) holes were very small and there was hardly any air coming in. It was hot, sweaty and difficult to breathe. They probably suffocated,” said Lindholm.
“The crew is very focused, they had a task to solve, but I can tell that they are affected by the tragedy that was taken on board the Swedish ship,” he added.
Police and coastguard officers said late on Thursday that they had identified suspected human smugglers on board one of the boats and would be passing the information on to Italian colleagues.
“We have information to pass on to Italian police concerning a number of individuals on board,” said Lindholm.

Italian media said late on Thursday that a refrigerated lorry was at the dock at Palermo to take away the bodies for examination by forensic experts.
Palermo's prosecutor opened a murder inquiry similar to that launched by Catania earlier this month after the discovery of 49 bodies in the hold of another packed fishing boat.
Shortly after the bodies were brought ashore, Libya's coastguard announced that another boat, carrying around 200 migrants, had capsized off the country's coast. At least 10 people drowned in that incident. The search for survivors was ongoing.
The Swedish vessel was in the area as part of the EU border agency Frontex's search and rescue operation known as Triton. It is expected to be sailing home on Monday as its role in the mission comes to an end.

Calm weather this week appears to have encouraged the smugglers to get as many people as possible out to sea, knowing that, in most cases, they will be picked up by Italian or international boats and taken to Italian ports.
More than 110,000 migrants have so far landed at Italian ports this year. A further 160,000-plus have arrived in Greece.
But at least 2,300 migrants have died at sea this year during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers."

Migrants in Calais are making nightly bids to cross the Channel.
The UK and French governments have announced they will bolster security around the Eurotunnel site in Calais.
Mr Johansson was critical of Mr Cameron's rhetoric: ""I hear what he is saying about 'illegal immigrants' and 'swarms' and I think he is trying to divide people, that that is not a constructive way.""
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme, Mr Johansson criticised Mr Cameron for using the word ""illegal"" about asylum seekers before they have been through asylum the process, and said they were seeking a basic human right.
Sweden was currently accepting around 1,000-1,200 asylum applicants a week, Johansson said.
Since 2013, Sweden has thrown its doors open to Syrians, granting them near automatic residency and boosting overall asylum applications -- the highest per capita in the EU according to Eurostat -- to record levels.
Last year Sweden accepted 30,000 asylum seekers compared to the UK's 10,000.

Swedish coastguard spokesman Mattias Lindholm told AFP the Poseidon had been able to save 439 people on the wooden boat.

The Swedish coastguard crew leaves behind three dramatic months taking part in the EU's border operation Triton.
Its last effort saw 572 migrants rescued from a rubber boat off the coast of Libya – but 52 dead bodies were tragically found below deck in a wooden boat.
“Nobody can be part of an operation like this without being affected and touched,” Kenneth Neijnes, head of the Swedish mission, told the TT news wire of his crew on Monday.
The statistics show the extent of the rescue operation. Around 100 crew members participated in the effort during which Poseidon helped rescue a total of 5,295 migrants: 4,330 men, 544 women and 421 children. Fatalities: 53.
But Neijnes emphasizes that they are more than just numbers.
“I wish that everyone could join us and see the situation on the ground. It is easy to speak about migrants and refugees – but they are people.""
One of the refugees he will remember the most is a ten-year-old boy.
“He was so frightened and was on the verge of becoming apathetic. (…) These children are so vulnerable and have experienced things that children should never have to experience,” he says.
“When you're down there you are preoccupied with work but afterwards the thoughts come. What happened to that ten-year-old boy, where did he go? It feels like a sign of poverty if we can't offer protection. If I look around here in Sweden, we have the ability to help.”

His staff began the journey home to Gothenburg at noon on Sunday after carrying out a total of 21 rescue operations from June 1st to August 1st. People from around 30 different countries were plucked from the water – mainly from Eritrea, Syria and Sudan.
Neijnes hints that another, bigger, operation could be on the cards, but adds that a government decision would be required to make it happen.

Earlier on Monday the European Union called an emergency meeting of interior and justice ministers in Brussels on September 14th to find measures to cope with escalating migration following a joint call for action by several nations.
The number of migrants reaching the EU's borders reached nearly 340,000 during the first seven months of the year, up from 123,500 during the same period in 2014, according to the bloc's border agency Frontex.
At least 2,300 migrants have died at sea since January during attempts to reach Europe, almost invariably on overcrowded boats chartered by people smugglers."

					13:02 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,'Stop deporting skilled migrants!' Swedish CEOs say,"A group of CEOs representing some of Sweden's most prominent companies, including retail giant H&M and telecom equipment maker Ericsson, on Friday slammed the country for deporting a number of highly-skilled workers.
In a letter published by the financial daily Dagens Industri and signed by around 30 bosses – including H&M CEO Stefan Persson and Ericsson chief executive Börje Ekholm – they write that expulsions of foreign employees ""harm business"" and that ""Swedish companies need to hire globally"".
""We cannot expect engineers, IT-technicians, and other specialists to leave their countries if they risk expulsion from Sweden for unpredictable reasons,"" they added.
The migration agency has faced criticism for refusing to extend foreign employees' work permits, leading to expulsion, on controversial grounds.
Hussein Ismail, a Lebanese engineer at a biotech company that he founded in 2012, is facing deportation along with his wife and children after cutting his own wage for three months in 2015 to help his company survive.

Sweden's strict laws against social dumping stipulate that if a foreign worker receives a salary below a collective agreement, then that employee must be sent back to the country of origin.
In other cases, the migration agency decided to deport a foreign worker who failed to take the required amount of holiday and because of an administrative error made by an employer.
The migration agency doesn't comment publicly on individual cases but insists on the respect for the Swedish rule of law when it sends a deportation order.
Jenny Lindén Urnes, head of a group specializing in steel coatings, said the expulsions are ""an absurd soap opera"" that ""weakens Sweden's competitiveness"".
And Ericsson CEO Ekholm warned in the letter that if the company ""wants to keep its research activities in Sweden, then economic immigration must operate in a transparent and predictable way"".
Job shortages and unemployed foreigners
Such complaints may have been heard. In December, the Migration Court of Appeal handed down a ruling aimed at introducing more flexibility in handling the cases.
""This is still insufficient, put an end to these tragedies and do it now,"" the bosses said in the letter.
According to Johan Attby, founder of the social network Fishbrain, Stockholm will have to find 60,000 IT professionals by 2020 or risk losing its status as a hub for startups.
""We have a continued broad job growth and a widespread labour shortage in several professions,"" Annelie Almérus, analyst at the Swedish Public Employment service, said in a report.
""This provides good job opportunities within a record amount of professions,"" she added.
The need for engineers, teachers and nurses in Sweden are evident.
Sweden has received 400,000 asylum applications since 2012, a record per capita in Europe.
This boost to its ageing population will only bear fruit in the long run: many applicants are still in school and others lack the required skills and qualifications.
""You need at least a high-school degree to get a long-term establishment in the job market,"" Almérus said.
Foreign-born residents are five times as likely (20 percent) to be unemployed as those born in the Nordic nation, according to the Statistics Sweden authority.
The unemployment average was 6.5 percent in January, according to new figures presented by Statistics Sweden on Friday. Starting from May, Sweden's centre-left minority government is to expand subsidized entry-level jobs, a move demanded by employers."

					18:16 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Did a Swedish council buy apartments for a man and his three wives?,"A Swedish municipality has hit back after it was criticized for offering a man and his three wives housing in apartments bought for more than 13.9 million kronor ($1.75 million) in total.
Nacka municipality hit back at claims spread by the local branch of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party that it had bought three bostadsrätter (a type of private housing cooperative which is a common form of home ownership in Sweden) in Saltsjöbaden for the man and his three wives.
""Nacka municipality has not purchased housing for any individual. The municipal's purchase of bostadsrätter is part of the work of arranging housing for new arrivals with a residence permit,"" it wrote in response to questions raised over the rumours.
""In 2017 Nacka municipality is to receive 370 new arrivals assigned by the Migration Agency.""
The Local, as well as several Swedish media including Metro and Swedish radio, has taken a closer look at the claims. This is what we found.
Nacka municipality, south of Stockholm, has bought 94 bostadsrätter worth around 305 million kronor since January last year, according to the local authority and to publicly available documents. The majority of these apartments, but not all of them according to the council, are rented out to newly arrived immigrants.
One of these has been allocated to a 57-year-old man, his wife and their children.
Another two apartments have been allocated to two other women, who are also registered in official Swedish records as both married to the same 57-year-old man, and their children. The women are all in their 40s.
Polygamy is normally illegal in Sweden, but such marriages are considered valid if the couples married in a country where it is allowed, if they married voluntarily and had no links to Sweden at the time.
The three apartments in question were bought by the local authority for 5.45 million, 5.2 million and 3.3 million kronor, according to public documents by Nacka's city development committee, seen by The Local.
According to the most recent figures by real estate statistics company Svensk Mäklarstatistik, the national average price for a bostadsrätt is 40,687 kronor per square metre, compared to 54,341 kronor in Nacka.
""The municipality does not purchase apartments over the market rate and not in the most expensive areas,"" said Nacka municipality on their website.
The Local has seen the addresses and the apartments are located in seaside town Saltsjöbaden, but on the outskirts and not in one of the most expensive areas.
Nacka municipality defended the purchase of the 94 bostadsrätter (some of which according to the council are also used to house other residents who need a temporary apartment through the social services) as part of their obligation to ensure accommodation is provided for new arrivals.
According to a new law which came into effect on March 2016 to handle the previous year's record influx of around 163,000 asylum seekers to Sweden, municipalities are obligated to take in and find housing for refugees assigned to them by the Migration Agency, in an effort to share the accommodation load.
""I am as frustrated as everyone else. We're doing it because we have to,"" wrote Nacka's mayor Mats Gerdau, a member of the conservative Moderate Party, on Facebook, arguing against the law but defending the purchase of bostadsrätter.
""Some say we should ignore the law. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think you should obey existing laws.""
Many new arrivals find their own apartment, often staying with friends or relatives. But those who can't get assigned to a municipality where they move once they have their residence permit. The municipality is then to find them a home for two years, after which they are to move out and find their own accommodation.
""I want to emphasize that no one GETS an apartment. The municipality provides a first home for a maximum of two years,"" wrote Gerdau.
""Of course you pay rent. And it is often crowded and you have to share an apartment.""
""Everyone should realize that this law is not particularly good, other than possibly for the state which can empty its refugee centres and pass the responsibilty and costs to the muncipalities, who are forced into short-term and expensive solutions,"" he continued.
According to Svenska Dagbladet, in May this year a total of 52 of Sweden's 290 municipalities had bought bostadsrätter to sublet to new arrivals. Others have used council-owned first-hand rentals (hyresrätter), set up temporary buildings or been helped by private landlords. Nacka has also used some of these options.
