					09:04 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Majority support law change to allow rejected asylum seekers to stay: survey,"A majority of Germans are in favour of a proposed rule change which would allow rejected asylum seekers to stay in the country if they were in work or education. Only 31 percent were against the proposals.
A survey carried out by Insa shows that 58 percent of Germans said they supported the idea of allowing rejected asylum seekers to remain in the country if they were integrating well, Bild reported on Tuesday evening.
Only 31 percent said that they were against the proposals, and would prefer that all those whose asylum claims had been rejected were deported.
The survey comes after weeks of political debate over a rule change suggested by CDU politician Daniel Günther.
Willingness to integrate the decisive factor
Günther, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, had argued that those asylum seekers who were already in work or education should be allowed to stay, even if they had their claims rejected. He pointed to complaints from employers who had spent time and money on hard-working employees, only to later see them deported.
The proposals were quickly backed by the Greens and the social democratic SPD, but were met with resistance from within Günther’s own party.
The new survey, which covered over 3,000 respondents over a five-day period in the last week, appears to show that the German public are broadly behind Günther’s suggestions.
“The willingness to integrate on the part of asylum seekers is the decisive factor for most Germans when deciding whether or not they are for or against deportations,” said Insa chief executive Hermann Binkert.
Only four percent of the respondents said that they were fundamentally opposed to deportations, while 89 percent said that rejected asylum seekers who do not integrate should be deported."

“It is important that people who are integrated and already have completed a training course also have the chance to work,” Günther told broadcaster ARD on Monday. “For this we need to enable a change of track whereby asylum law is no longer applicable but rather a new immigration law.”
Germany’s coalition government agreed in July that it would start work on a new immigration law by the end of the year. The intention of any new law would be to make it easier for qualified workers to obtain a visa to live and work in Germany.
Coalition partners SPD welcomed Günter's proposals on Tuesday, saying that they represented a shift in tone in the CDU.
""This change of track is something that the CDU/CSU were firmly against in the coalition negotiations, so this is good,"" said SPD deputy chairman Ralf Stegner.
Günther’s proposal met immediate resistance from the Christian Social Union (CSU), the most conservative party in the coalition government.
A spokesman for the CSU-controlled Interior Ministry told ARD that “we wouldn’t allow a ‘track change’.”
“We want want an immigration law that puts people into employment not into the employment centre,” he said.
Germany currently has significant problems with filling open positions in a wide range of skilled professions. A study by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) found that a record high 1.2 million jobs remained unfilled at the end of last year.
While there is wide consensus in the Bundestag that Germany needs a new immigration law, there is also furious debate about how to deal with the asylum seekers who arrived in the country in 2015 and 2016.
The far-right Alternative for Germany have demanded that the government step up deportations of failed asylum seekers, while politicians from the SPD and the Green Party have argued that asylum seekers must be given better access to the job market.
The Green Party's Manfred Lucha proposed a draft for a new immigration law earlier this month, but Günther is the first high profile CDU politician to call for a right to work for rejected asylum seekers."

					12:00 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,"Over 500,000 rejected asylum seekers still live in Germany","A new report shows that more than half a million people who had their asylum applications rejected are still living in Germany, three-quarters of whom have been in the country for more than six years.
In a parliamentary inquiry from Die Linke (the Left Party), the federal government revealed that as of the end of June, there were 549,209 people living in Germany who had had their asylum application rejected, Bild reported on Thursday.
About three quarters of them had been living in Germany at least six years.
The largest group came from Turkey (about 77,600), followed by Kosovo (68,549) and Serbia (50,817). Serbia and Kosovo were declared safe countries of origin by the German government in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
About half of the total number had an unlimited permit to stay, and another third had a temporary permit to stay.
Bild also reported that there were 168,212 people living as “tolerated” immigrants - 100,000 of whom had had their asylum applications rejected. And another 37,020 “tolerated” immigrants were allowed to stay because they lacked travel documents.
What happens when asylum is rejected
Even if someone has their asylum application rejected, the government may still recognize that there is another reason to protect them inside the country.
Asylum seekers who have their applications rejected may appeal their decisions, all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights, which can take months.
Another option if someone has their asylum application turned down is that they may receive “subsidiary protection” from deportation if they do not meet the requirements for gaining refugee or asylum status, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
“There may be reasons that prevent him or her from being deported. These include the threat of the death penalty, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or other existential threats - meaning that the foreign national is to be regarded as vulnerable,” the BAMF website states.
If someone is not granted refugee protection, asylum or subsidiary protection, they may also be granted a ban on deportation. This is issued in the case where a “foreigner faces a substantial concrete danger or an extreme general danger on return to the destination state,” including poor health care if they are ill, BAMF states.
“Protection against deportation... is asserted in particular (but not exhaustively) if for instance the danger of a considerable worsening of an existing illness is likely because of inadequate medical treatment in the destination state, or if such treatment is not available at all.”
If someone is not granted any of these protections, BAMF then issues a request for the person to leave Germany with a deportation notice. They are then given a week to 30 days to leave, depending on the reason for deportation. BAMF also notifies the country of origin and it then becomes the responsibility of the German state where the asylum applicant resides to enforce the deportation.
But Germany has struggled with getting people to leave voluntarily and for countries to take them back.
In February, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière urged Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia to speed up their process of taking back their citizens whose asylum applications had been rejected in Germany. These countries had been refusing or delaying the processing of taking people back because they were missing identification documents.
It was also reported in February that Germany was paying refugees to go back home, covering travel costs and even sometimes giving them cash for when they return.
Push for swifter deportations
Conservative politicians from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and sister party CSU (Christian Social Union) have continued to push for swifter deportation processes for rejected asylum seekers.
In response to Bild’s report, chair of the CDU/CSU Union in German parliament Hans-Peter Friedrich called for a reform of the deportation laws.
“Whoever allows rejected asylum seekers to dance circles around the state is destroying the people’s trust in the capabilities of the government,” Friedrich told Bild.
“The laws urgently need to be changed.”

					11:54 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'No sign of life': Germany deports asylum seeker to China by mistake,"German authorities wrongfully deported an Uighur man to China due to an administrative error, local media reported Monday, in a fresh scandal as the country seeks to step up expulsions of failed asylum seekers.
Officials were due to hold a hearing with the 22-year-old Uighur, who was not named, on April 3rd over his asylum application, said regional public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR).
But a fax announcing the hearing from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) apparently failed to reach local authorities in Bavaria, who, in the early hours of April 3, put the Uighur man on a plane to Beijing.
""We were unable to find the fax despite an intensive search,"" Munich authorities told BR.
""We regret greatly that the deportation took place even though a valid asylum application had been made. It was never the intention of the immigration authorities of Munich to infringe on the rights of the foreigner affected by the expulsion.""
The BAMF would not give details on individual cases but told the broadcaster that expulsion would be ""inadmissible"" under such circumstances.
The Uighur asylum seeker's lawyer Leo Borgmann said he has had no news from his client since the deportation.
""There is no sign of life. We fear that he has been detained,"" Borgmann told BR.
Secretive network
Many of China's mostly Muslim Uighur minority say they face cultural and religious repression.
Members of the Uighur diaspora say relatives have been arrested for seemingly innocuous acts such as sending Ramadan greetings to friends or downloading popular music.
Chinese authorities are also believed to have detained hundreds of thousands of Muslims in a secretive network of extra-judicial political re-education centres, where inmates are given language and ideological
training and forced to participate in military-style drills.
The case surfaced after a series of administrative errors that led to illegal deportations by German authorities.
In a further controversial case, a German court in July ordered that a man who allegedly worked as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden be returned to Germany only hours after his deportation to Tunisia, saying the expulsion was illegal as he risks torture there.
The 42-year-old, identified by German authorities only as Sami A. and by Tunis as Sami Idoudi, had lived in Germany for more than two decades, but outrage over his presence grew in recent months.
Although he had won a court ruling against his deportation, the decision reached federal authorities by fax a day later - hours after his flight to Tunisia had taken off.
Also in July, the interior ministry was forced to repatriate an asylum seeker who had been deported to Afghanistan even though his legal appeal against expulsion was ongoing.
In June, another Afghan man who was allowed back into Germany after he was illegally deported from the country was officially granted asylum."

Merkel's conservative bloc on Monday gave her a two-week ultimatum to tighten asylum rules or risk pitching Germany into a political crisis that would also rattle Europe.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer's CSU party at a meeting unanimously backed his call to give Merkel a fortnight to find a European deal on the burning issue by a June 28th-29th EU summit, failing which he would order border police to turn back migrants.
Three years after her decision to open Germany's borders to migrants fleeing war in Syria and Iraq and misery elsewhere, Merkel is still struggling to find a sustainable response to complaints from the CSU, her Bavarian allies, over her refugee policy.

Merkel's woes come as European Union countries are once again at loggerheads over immigration, triggered by Italy's refusal this month to allow a rescue ship carrying 630 migrants to dock.
Malta also turned the vessel away, sparking a major EU row until Spain agreed to take in the new arrivals.
Seehofer has been one of the fiercest critics of Merkel's liberal stance, under which over one million asylum seekers have been admitted into the country since 2015.
He wants to turn away at the border new arrivals who have previously been registered in another EU country -- often their first port of call, Italy or Greece.
But Merkel says that would leave countries at the EU's southern periphery alone to deal with the migrant influx. Instead, she wants to find a common European solution at the EU summit in Brussels.
""How Germany acts will decide whether Europe stays together or not,"" Merkel told her CDU party's leadership at a meeting in Berlin, according to participants.
Anti-immigrant boost
Popular misgivings over the migrant influx have given populist and anti-immigration forces a boost across several European nations, including Italy and Austria where far-right parties are now sharing power.
In Germany, voters in September's election handed Merkel her poorest score ever, giving seats for the first time to the far-right anti-Islam AfD.
Several high profile crimes by migrants have also fuelled public anger. They include a deadly 2016 Christmas market attack by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker and the rape-murder in May of a teenage girl, allegedly by an Iraqi.
With an eye on October's Bavaria state election, the CSU is anxious to assure voters that it has a roadmap to curb the migrant influx.
""We must send a signal to the world: it's no longer possible to just set foot on European soil in order to get to Germany,"" a leading CSU figure, Alexander Dobrindt, told the party meeting.
Seehofer had struck a more conciliatory tone, telling Bild on Sunday: ""It is not in the CSU's interest to topple the chancellor, to dissolve the CDU-CSU union or to break up the coalition.
""We just want to finally have a sustainable solution to send refugees back to the borders.""
'Almost a miracle'
Merkel now faces the challenge of persuading EU governments to sign up to a common plan on the migrants.
Central and eastern EU nations such as Hungary and Poland have either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under an EU quota system.
A populist-far right government in Italy and the conservative-far right cabinet in neighbouring Austria have also taken an uncompromising stance.
Merkel's talks later Monday with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in Germany could prove crucial if she is to have any chance of forging an agreement in Brussels.
On Tuesday, she will also meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Germany.
Berlin is also reportedly preparing to call a meeting between Merkel and the leaders of several EU frontline nations in the migrant crisis ahead of the EU summit.
""It would be almost a miracle if she emerges a winner from the next EU summit,"" Welt daily said.
But the chancellor may have no choice, as Seehofer could still launch the nuclear option of shutting Germany's borders in defiance of her -- an act of rebellion which would force her to sack him.
That ""would be the end of the government and the alliance between CDU and CSU,"" an unnamed CDU source told Bild."

The sentencing in the western German town of Landau came at a time when anti-migrant protests have erupted in the eastern city of Chemnitz over the fatal stabbing of a man, allegedly by a Syrian and an Iraqi.
The judges sentenced Abdul D., who says he is from Afghanistan, for the murder and assault of the teenager called Mia, following a juvenile justice case, the court said on Monday.
The prosecution had previously demanded a prison sentence of 10 years, while the defence hoped for seven years and six months for manslaughter, reports Focus Online. Prosecutors believe that he acted out of jealousy after she broke up with him.
The incident happened on December 27th, 2017 in the middle of a drugstore and caused nationwide horror.
Right-wing populist groups took the case as an opportunity to repeatedly protest in Kandel against the asylum policy of the federal government.
The case also fuelled the discussion about the age determination of young refugees.
After his arrival in Germany, Abdul D. was admitted and cared for as an unaccompanied minor refugee. He said he was 15-years-old at the time of the crime; however, doubts have been raised about his age.
An expert had estimated his age as between 17 and a half and 20 years old. Nevertheless, the court hearing took place behind closed doors and under juvenile penal rules.
Abdul D. arrived in Germany in April 2016 and his request for asylum was rejected on February 2017, although he was not immediately deported.
The case is one in a string of high profile crimes allegedly committed by asylum seekers that has stoked popular anger against the new arrivals and put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel over her liberal refugee policy.
Far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been mobilizing regular demonstrations over the killing in the small town with a population of just 9,000, as it sought to bolster its anti-migrant campaign.
At the peak of the protests, thousands marched in Kandel. But they appear to have since lost momentum.
On Saturday, a demonstration in the town attracted 350 people, local police said.
Residents of the small town frustrated by the far-right rallies also lined the demonstration route, carrying banners like ""Stop hate and incitement"" or ""Kandel is colourful, not brown"" - in reference to the Nazi's khaki uniforms, according to DPA.
Rhineland-Palatinate state premier Malu Dreyer accused the far-right of exploiting the teenager's death for political gains, saying it was ""intolerable"".
""It is the hope of all of us that once the trial is over, peace will return to Kandel,"" she said."

Police were alerted to the incident when they received a call about the man at 4:40pm.
When officers arrived at Hohenzollern Bridge, the man had asked for an interpreter. After an interpreter had been able to contact him, he climbed down.
""He told us he didn't want to kill himself,"" said a federal police spokesman.
The asylum application of the 29-year-old Iranian man had previously been rejected, a police spokesperson said. While on the bridge, the man had thrown notes down with poems written in Arabic script on them.
The protest action had large consequences for rush hour traffic as the Hohenzollern Bridge is particularly important for rail routes in and out of the west German city.
The bridge was subsequently closed for two and a half hours in the afternoon on Wednesday. According to Deutsche Bahn, the incident caused many diversions and partial disruptions because trains had to turn around to avoid using the bridge.
Eyewitnesses reported that the platforms at Cologne's main station were packed with people during the closure. Rescue workers from the city's fire brigade were also deployed and ships in the Rhine River under the bridge had to stop during the operation.
The asylum seeker has meanwhile been released again and, due to the disruption he caused, can expect to face a legal complaint."

On a cold evening in December 2016, a 45-year-old woman was jogging through a remote part of the English Garden when she was attacked from behind.
According to prosecutors, her attacker grabbed her headband, pulled it down around her neck and strangled her with it. She screamed out for help but nobody responded.
The man then tightened the headband around her throat until she began to bleed. She collapsed in unconsciousness, but the man continued to strangle her for another 30 seconds, seemingly indifferent to the fact that she was about to die.
He then raped her and left her body in a bush.
Prosecutors have charged 28-year-old Emrah T. with the woman's rape and attempted murder.
They argue that he believed his victim would die, either through the fact she had been strangled or because he had left her face down on the ground in temperatures of 2C.
But the woman regained consciousness minutes later and managed to drag herself to a nearby restaurant where she was found by a young couple.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, it was largely luck that led investigators to identify Emrah T. as the culprit four months later. After a break in at the storage facility at which he worked, police matched DNA at the scene to that of the rapist. Emrah T. was one of several employees at the facility who voluntarily gave DNA swabs to the authorities.
His DNA was also found to match that taken from the scene of a rape that took place in nearby Rosenheim in 2015. The rape, which took place weeks after Emrah T. arrived in Germany, was similar in its brutality, with the woman also strangled before the crime.
Emrah T. arrived in Germany with his pregnant wife in 2015 and applied for asylum. He told immigration authorities that he was Syrian but it later transpired that he was a Turkish national.
The crime shocked the quiet, conservative city of Munich when it took place. Police advised women to go jogging in groups and to stay in areas that were well lit.
It was also just one of several violent rapes that occured in public places at the end of 2016 in which the suspects were asylum seekers who had recently arrived in the country.
Last week, a verdict was handed down in the most high profile of those cases. A Freiburg court sentenced Hussein Khavari to life in jail after he was found guilty of the rape and murder of a 19-year-old student in the southern university town.
Critics of the German government's open door refugee policy, through which hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers arrived in the country in 2015 and 2016, say it has caused an increase in cases of rape and murder of women.

Police confirmed on Thursday that a body discovered the previous day in scrub land outside the state capital of Hesse belonged to 14-year-old Susanna F.
The teenager had been missing since May 22nd when she never turned up at home after meeting friends in the Wiesbaden town centre.
Several witness statements indicated that Susanna F. had been the victim of a crime.
Achim Thoma, the lead prosecutor in the case, said that Susanna had been strangled to death and that there was evidence she had been raped.

The other suspect, a 20-year-old from Iraqi, is believed to have fled back to his home country with his entire family. According, to Die Welt, the family used two different sets of identity papers to return home via Istanbul airport.
The breakthrough in the case came when a 13-year-old asylum seeker provided evidence to the police. It is not clear what relationship he had to the two suspects.

The Iraqi family are believed to have entered Germany during the refugee wave of late 2015.
Several brutal rapes and murders have raised debate in Germany about whether the mass arrivals of refugees in 2015 and 2016 has made the country more dangerous for women.
Earlier this year a refugee from Afghanistan was found guilty of raping and murdering a student in Freiburg. Meanwhile two Afghan youths are awaiting trial in separate cases over the stabbing to death of teenage girls.
In Munich, the trial started in March of a Turkish asylum seeker charged with raping and assaulting a jogger in the city’s English Garden park.
While the far-right Alternative for Germany claim the crimes are evidence that Germany should not be taking in immigrants from Muslim societies, liberal groups have said that the crimes should not be used to cast suspicion on entire ethnic and religious groups.

Legislation, which aims to reduce the migrant influx to Germany, would add Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Georgia to the ""safe"" country list that so far includes all EU members, six Balkans countries, Ghana and Senegal.
However, passage of the bill into law was far from certain after a first attempt was rejected last year in the upper house by states ruled by the Greens party, which advocates a humanitarian approach toward people seeking safe haven.
Greens party co-leader Robert Habeck said his left-leaning ecologist party had not changed its position on the three Maghreb states, arguing that journalists, homosexuals and other groups were not safe from persecution there.
""Therefore I don't see how these countries can be called safe,"" Habeck told the media group Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, presenting the initiative at a Berlin press conference, argued that the bill still allows authorities to evaluate individual cases on their merits.
He said the aim was to deter asylum requests, or to speed up their processing and likely deportations, from countries whose citizens have almost no chance of being granted residency rights in Germany.
Immigration and refugee flows have become a flashpoint issue in Germany since Chancellor Angela Merkel decided in 2015 to keep borders open to a mass influx of people fleeing war and misery in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries.
The move earned her praise from liberal commentators but also sparked a xenophobic backlash that last year saw the far-right and anti-Islam protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) enter parliament for the first time."

The warning was aimed in particular at Tunisia - the home nation of Anis Amri, who was suspected of ploughing a lorry into a Berlin Christmas market last month in an attack that killed 12 people - and at north African nations in general.
Germany rejected Amri's asylum application last June, but Tunis initially denied he was a Tunisian citizen, blocking him from being sent home. A new Tunisian travel document for the 24-year-old only arrived two days after the slaughter in Berlin.
Several thousand citizens of north African nations, including those with almost no chance of obtaining asylum in Germany, are similarly lacking papers to return home.
The Christmas market attack has pushed the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel to consider how to improve the system.
Authorities are considering more routinely placing failed asylum seekers viewed as dangerous Islamists in detention ahead of their deportation.

""As a consequence of this completely unacceptable action, we are declaring the representative of the Vietnamese secret service at the embassy persona non grata, and giving him 48 hours to leave,"" added the spokesman.

The man had resurfaced on Monday in Vietnam, where state-owned newspapers reported that he had turned himself in to authorities.
Thanh headed the state-owned Petro Vietnam Construction Corporation but had been sought by Hanoi. Once a lawmaker, he was stripped of his seat and kicked out of the communist party.
According to German news agency DPA, he has been accused of having caused losses amounting to €125 million at the Vietnamese company.

A total of 222,560 people applied for asylum in the Bundesrepublik last year, figures released on Monday by the European asylum authority EASO show.
That total marked a 70 percent drop from 2016 when three quarters of a million people applied for asylum.
Across the whole of the EU plus Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, the number of asylum applications dropped by 44 percent from 1.3 million to 728,000. That was the second year in a row that the number of applications dropped after the high point of the refugee crisis in 2015.
Most of the applications had come from citizens of Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan - all countries that have been torn apart by civil war in recent years.
In some countries, including Italy, Greece and Spain, the number of applications for asylum grew last year.
The decline in Europe-wide applications is set to continue in 2018; up until April, 197,000 applications were made across the continent.

					11:53 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,Germany should deport sick refugees: Merkel party mate,"A top member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU party on Monday defended his proposal for Germany to deport sick refugees after receiving harsh criticism.
“Whoever is not fit to travel can also not be deported,” the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician and interior minister of Baden-Württemberg Thomas Strobl told Die Welt in an interview published on Monday.
“But we must be honest: If someone still manages to make the arduous journey over the Mediterranean or through the Balkan route, despite an illness, and then we must determine that they have no chance to be able to stay, one must at least consider if it is also possible that they could brought back on an airplane within a few hours.”
“One cannot give hundreds of thousands of people departure orders, but then not consistently implement them. That undermines the sustainability and substance of trust in the state.”
Strobl had presented a position paper about a week ago in which he also called for a tougher asylum policy, including cutting social benefits and building a repatriation centre in Egypt. The plan stated that those who are ill before they come to Germany could also be deported if their asylum applications are rejected.
He argued in the interview on Monday that his plan still fell in line with Merkel's policies of having “open borders and hearts”.
“We have an open heart for those who need protection… We are in solidarity with anyone who is suffering. But it cannot be that immigrants can creep through the back door and massively abuse our asylum system.
“I can understand if people want to stay with us because they see better economic prospects. But asylum laws are definitely not the solution.”
Strobl's plan was criticized last week after it was presented.
“The CDU is also now using populist slogans,” said Social Democrat (SPD) general secretary Katarina Barley to the Passauer Neue Presse.
And Strobl's fellow CDU party mate Klaus Bouillon said the plan would “by no means” be on the official agenda of a conference of German interior ministers last week.
Bouillon added that there are “clear legal guidelines” for handling sick asylum seekers.
A report in September by Bild showed that more than 500,000 rejected asylum seekers were still living in Germany. Many had received other permits to stay aside from asylum status, or were considered “tolerated” if they, for example, lacked travel documents.

International consulting firm McKinsey said in a report to the German government, seen by Die Welt on Sunday, that the country needed a coordinated deportation system with states.
“For this purpose, appropriate deportation and custody centres should be established,” the report notes.
McKinsey also recommends stricter regulations for tolerated immigrants. Those who are sick or have no travel documents and thus cannot be deported should only receive food and clothing instead of money, the report recommends."

					17:02 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Asylum processes now taking three times as long as expected,"It currently takes on average more than ten months to process an individual asylum application - three times as long as previously expected, according to a new government report.
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) needed on average 10.4 months to process one asylum case in the first quarter of this year, according to a government response to a parliamentary inquiry released on Thursday.
The German government had previously said that such processes should last about three months, according to Die Linke (Left Party) politician Ulla Jelpke, whose party submitted the inquiry.
The government report further showed that the processes have been getting longer over time. In 2015, the process took 5.2 months, while in 2016 individual processes took about 7.1 months.
Jelpke called the prolonged processing times a “disastrous record”.
BAMF blamed the extended processing times on the increasing number of complex old cases that have been piling up. When officials only consider new cases, the processing time is much shorter: For about 70,800 new applications received between October 2016 and March, the length of time for a decision was about 1.9 months on average.
The amount of time asylum seekers had to wait for a decision also varied greatly by homeland. Those from Guinea on average waited 16.1 months, those from Russia 15.2 months, Somalis 14.9 months, and Nigerians 14.4 months. But Albanians got decisions within 5.6 months on average, Syrians in 7.5 months.
Unaccompanied minors had to wait on average 11.3 months.
The application process is expected to face further delays as BAMF is set to re-examine up to 100,000 positive asylum decisions in the wake of a scandal involving a German soldier who managed to obtain protected status through a fake Syrian identity, despite speaking no Arabic.

The soldier, Franco Albrecht, was arrested in April over suspicions that he was plotting a far-right terror attack with another soldier and a civilian, which the three then reportedly planned to blame on his fake refugee identity.
The case has raised questions about far-right extremism within Germany's military, as well as about the country's ability to properly process the asylum applications of around one million refugees who have entered the country over the past two years.
The Interior Minister said last week that delays could be expected, “but thoroughness comes before speed.”"

In the past year, significantly fewer asylum seekers came to Germany compared to 2015 - about 610,000 fewer in fact, according to the Interior Ministry. In 2015, around 890,000 had arrived in the country seeking refuge, compared to 280,000 in 2016.
“This shows that the measures taken by Germany and Europe have been effective,” said Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière, of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU party.
“We have been successful in regulating and controlling the immigration situation.”
A major reason for the drop in the number of asylum seekers is the closure of the so-called Balkan route in March. The EU also last year agreed to a controversial deal with Turkey to take in recognized Syrian refugees from the country, if Turkey would take back those who leave its shores to enter the EU without permission.
The German government also designated some western Balkan countries as “safe”, thus making it more difficult for their citizens to gain refugee status.
The number of people who applied for asylum last year that had arrived before or during 2016 reached more than 745,000 - roughly 269,000 more than in 2015.
The increase is because a large portion had arrived in 2015, during a record year for asylum seekers in Germany. Many could not immediately apply for asylum due to overwhelmed immigration authorities.
“The mountain of pending applications was worn down,” said de Maizière.
The largest group of asylum seekers to apply were Syrians, fleeing an ongoing violent civil war. They made up more than one-third of applications, following by Afghans (17 percent) and Iraqis (13 percent)."

					17:55 CET+01:00				", The Local,Germany ‘pays African states to take asylum rejects',"If Germany can't deport a refugee back to the country they claim to be from, it gives financial incentives to other countries to take them in, a refugee organization claims.
It is a grim picture. After years of waiting on an asylum application and exhausting their various appeal processes, an asylum seeker is put into a plane back to Africa.
But the country he lands in is not his own. His only attachment to it is that it is a country he travelled through to get to Europe.
Sometimes given €50 by German authorities, sometimes given nothing at all, from here the migrant is left to go it alone.
According to refugee rights organization Pro Asyl, this is a scenario that results from Germany attaching “Readmission Agreements” to development aid to African countries.
""These agreements commit the African countries to readmitting their own citizens who have had asylum turned down by Germany, but it also allows them to readmit rejected asylum seekers from other countries, who travelled through these transit states,"" Max Pichl of Pro Asyl told The Local.
This is in fact a Europe-wide practise, first implemented by Spain, he adds.
But this isn't all. If Germany can't deport someone because they can't confirm his country of origin, they will pay a third country to ""confirm"" his nationality and issue him the necessary documentation, Pro Asyl alleges.
“It is difficult to say how many people it affects,” Pichl says. “The cases only come to light on an individual basis when someone who has been sent back to Africa reports it.""
But he says there is “a very long list of countries with whom Germany has such agreements.”
He concedes though that while many of the agreements have not been made publicly available, from what he knows “countries are obliged to take back migrants, but nothing more is specified.”
The Federal Office for Migration (BAMF) and refugees notes that it has 13 bilateral Readmission Agreements.
BAMF does not give data for how many people have been deported through transit countries, saying only that ""these arrangements make it possible for foreigners to return or be returned via the contracting Member State without the need of a transit visa.""
Paid for positive answers
Pro Asyl's statement supports a report this week in Der Freitag, a left-wing newspaper, which documented how exactly this process takes place.
People who have been given deportation orders, but whose country of origin can't be determined, are sent to mass meetings with delegates from embassies of countries it would be legally admissible to send them back to.
In 2014, 50 of these meetings took place with representatives from 18 different African countries and 720 asylum seekers were ordered to attend, meaning that at each around ten people were interviewed.
Germany pays the embassies of these countries for the time they take to perform this service.
But embassies receive a further sum if they grant the asylum seeker the appropriate documentation - a so-called “emergency travel certificate” - so that Germany can within days order the person to pack their bags and put them on a plane.
""These processes are far from serious,” Der Freitag comments, saying that they often take only a matter of minutes.
The embassies of certain countries are rewarded more than others for awarding migrants documentation. So for example Benin receives €300 for every ""positive"" identification, while Nigeria gets €250.
The Benin embassy also makes positive identification in around three quarters of cases, whereas Nigeria does so in one out of two.
As part of its research, Der Freitag reported the case of a man who claimed to come from Sierra Leone. but because he didn't have the papers to prove it, he was sent to a test with the Nigerian embassy.
Despite denying he came from their country, the Nigerian officials gave him documentation on which it stated he had described himself as Nigerian.
Payments to the Nigerian embassy have now been stopped. But a Die Linke (the Left party) politician told Der Freitag this is simply a move ""to extract a bit of the smell of corruption.""
'Only possible way'
As German public mood has started to shift against the government's liberal stance towards refugees, more and more politicians have called for the speeding up of deportations.
In a new package of asylum regulations announced on Friday, the government vowed to speed up deportations to North Africa by assigning Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco as ""countries of safe origin.""
But this only solves part of the problem. Many refugees arrive in Germany without any papers, either because they never had any, or because they threw them away before they arrived.
According to Der Freitag, a lack of official documentation is the biggest hindrance to deporting rejecting asylum seekers.
The German government has itself defended the policy of asking foreign embassies to conduct nationality checks.
Replying to a parliamentary question from Die Linke (the left party) in 2011 the government said that the tests were “often the only possibility to establish the nationality of the person to be deported.”"

Asylum seekers who enter the European Union through Greece should be sent back there, Germany's interior minister has said.
Thomas de Maziere told a Greek paper on Sunday that the he wanted to reinstate EU rules under which asylum seekers are returned to the first EU country they reach. He also argued that Greece should send more people back to Turkey.
""I would like the Dublin convention to be applied again... we will take up discussions on this in a meeting with (EU) interior ministers"" later in October, he told the Greek daily Kathimerini.
The Dublin accord gives responsibility for asylum seekers' application to the first country they reach – which put Greece on the frontline of more than a million migrants who arrived in the EU last year.
The accord also says asylum seekers should be sent back to the first country they arrived in if they subsequently reach another EU state before their case is examined. A huge proportion of the migrants ended up in Germany.
But this clause was suspended for Greece in 2011 after the country lost an EU legal complaint which condemned the mistreatment of migrants seeking international protection.
""Since then, the EU has provided substantial support, not only financially,"" to Greece to improve its asylum seeker procedures, the German minister said.
'Greece must expel more'
In an interview on German television Sunday evening, De Maiziere also criticised Athens for failing to fully implement an EU agreement with Turkey to return migrants there.
The EU reached a deal with Turkey in March to stop the influx to the Greek islands in return for financial aid and eased visa conditions for its citizens. But the deal has looked shaky in the wake of a coup attempt in Turkey in July.
""Greece must carry out more expulsions,"" he told the ARD television station.
De Maiziere had already in August highlighted the need to reinstate the Dublin rules, provoking an outcry from Athens.
Greece stressed it was already coping with over 60,000 refugees and migrants blocked on its territory after countries further north on the so-called Balkan route closed their borders to the massive influx, notably fleeing the Syrian conflict.
De Maiziere said he was conscious of the ""strong reactions"" of Greeks, as well as the huge number of migrants being dealt with by Greece as an EU frontline state.
But ""that doesn't annul the need"" to reinstate the Dublin rules, he said, stressing that ""criticism of the convention not being applied keeps increasing in Germany.""
The German minister, who has just revised the number of asylum seekers who arrived in Germany last year to 890,000 – down from a previous estimate of 1.1 million – reiterated Berlin's commitment to taking its share of refugees who arrived in Greece and Italy in 2015 and the start of 2016.
""Germany is ready to welcome up to 500 people per month"" from the two countries, he said."

Another city official said that many of the immigrants coming from Ghana are women, many of whom are pregnant and want to give birth within the European Union - although a child born to foreign parents within Germany does not automatically receive German citizenship.
Ophelya added that though she saw some frowns when she went to register her baby's name, no one raised any objections.
Chancellor Merkel got some frowns and more directed her way recently after a Palestinian teenager started to cry in response to Merkel explaining why the country could not take in every immigrant seeking refuge.
The girl, Reem, later defended Merkel amid intense scrutiny of the Chancellor's seemingly awkward response to the situation, and officials said that Reem's family would likely be able to stay."

Arrivals, mainly from eastern Europe, jumped by almost two-thirds in 2013 to the highest level in 14 years, even though most applicants have little chance of being accepted as political refugees. In one residential home on the outskirts of the sprawling German capital, a family of six from Bosnia-Hercegovina now share a spartan room of just 25 square metres (270 square feet). The ethnic Roma family, who tried to leave behind a life of poverty and discrimination in Bosnia, now kill time in a room with just the bare necessities: a bed, a table and a dilapidated sofa. Their temporary abode, a former nursing home on the edge of a forest, was meant to close in mid-April. But, given the recent surge of asylum seekers, it is now expected to stay open longer. Across the city, in the tower blocks of Lichtenberg in the former East Berlin, people from 18 nations live in a 10-storey building that was converted into an asylum seekers' centre more than two years ago. ""We have 350 places in the centre but we currently have 360-370 people,"" said its director Birgit Bauer, adding that four or five people commonly share 20 square metres, with communal showers and toilets. ""Some families who already live in cramped conditions have agreed to accept more people into their studio apartments,"" she said. Since late 2010, Germany has seen the number of asylum seekers rise sharply. Last year the jump was 64 percent, to 127,023 applicants. And in January it rose by a record 76.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the Office for Migration. The leading country of origin last year was Serbia with more than 18,000 applications, up 40 percent on 2012. About 90 percent of them were Roma. Many have also come from Bosnia-Hercegovina, with arrivals up 104 percent in 2013, and Kosovo -- up 74.5 percent -- as well as Russia, including Chechnya. ""Many people from the former Yugoslavia found refuge in Germany during the war in the early '90s,"" said Bauer. ""Now they are returning with their families and, in their quest for a better future, see Germany as their last hope."" Citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia, another top country of origin, have since late 2009 been allowed to travel in the Schengen visa-free zone. Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic has said that many people from his country ""do not come for asylum but to take the money because the benefits are high"". In Germany, while waiting for their request to be processed, families are entitled to 134 euros ($185) per month for adults and 80 euros per child. The influx has been met by outbreaks of xenophobia, with neo-Nazis rallying last year outside a Berlin refugee centre. Berlin is currently housing 8,360 asylum seekers in centres built to house no more than 8,100 people. Some 450 others live in emergency accommodation in hotels ""for a few days or a week or two"", said Franz Allert, chairman of Berlin's Office of Health and Social Issues, which is responsible for refugee issues. ""The situation is tense, even serious because this year we need to again plan on new high numbers of asylum seekers,"" he said. ""Some centres should have closed long ago because they are run down and not at all appropriate, but we have no choice but to leave them open."" Non-profit and rights groups such as ProAsyl have denounced the slow pace of the German bureaucracy in reacting to the sharp rise in numbers and called for more staff to process asylum applications.

					11:42 CET+01:00				",Jörg Luyken,"No, German pilots aren't defying their government by refusing to deport asylum seekers","On Wednesday UK publication the Independent picked up a story in the German press about pilots refusing to take rejected asylum seekers back to Afghanistan. These rare decisions have nothing to do with the asylum process, though.
Anyone who read the Independent on Wednesday may well have had the impression that German pilots were en masse rebelling against their government's deportation policies for Afghan asylum seekers.
The newspaper originally ran the story under the headline “Pilots ground 222 flights after refusing to deport asylum seekers” before updating the headline to “Pilots stop 222 asylum seekers being deported from Germany by refusing to fly”.
While the number of 222 is itself correct it comes from a parliamentary question posed by Die Linke in November - there is no evidence that pilots refused to fly.
On November 22nd Die Linke asked the government the following question: “How many attempted deportations had to be cancelled between January 1st and September 30th 2017 because the airlines or pilots refused to transport the person set to be deported?”
The government's answer stated that a total of 222 deportations failed because the airlines refused to take the person on board.
In other words, during the first nine months of the year pilots refused to allow 222 people to board their planes. There is nothing in the government's reply which suggests the pilots refused to fly or that the planes did not take off.
One pilot who spoke anonymously to broadcaster RBB on Wednesday explained that the incidents were related to the safety of other passengers and had nothing to do with concerns about the safety of the deportee when they arrive back in their home country.
Pilots are obliged by paragraph 12 of the air security law to ensure safety on board their flight. Therefore, before flights on which deportees are scheduled to fly, the air crew receive a list containing these people's names.
Pilots meet the deportees in person before boarding and ask whether they want to fly. If a deportee says ""no"" and seems to be under pressure, Lufthansa pilots generally refuse to take them, the pilot explained.
“We need to assure that someone doesn't lose control during a flight. We need to protect our passengers from such a circumstance,” she said.
On the other hand, German residency law dictates that airlines are legally obliged to take all rejected asylum seekers who the government wishes to deport. Pilots who refuse purely on moral grounds would then likely face legal consequences.
“I don't know of any case in which a pilot refused to take a passenger on moral concerns,” a spokesperson for Lufthansa told RBB. “We are legally obliged to take the passengers - they have valid tickets.""
In fact pilots refusing to let people being deported onto their planes rarely happens. In the same time period that 222 deportees were refused by airlines, 16,700 people were deported through German airports.

					10:16 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Sharp fall in number of North African refugees,"The number of people arriving in Germany from North Africa seeking asylum has sunk drastically in the months since January, government figures seen by newspapers showed on Monday.
Compared with the 3,356 new arrivals from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria in January, the number entering Germany in March fell to 480 – one-seventh as many.
The figures come from a report sent from the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF) to lawmakers and seen by the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ).
Migrants from North Africa have been in the spotlight in Germany since New Year, when members of a crowd of mostly North African men gathered at Cologne's main train station committed large numbers of sexual assaults and petty thefts against women.
Outrage over the crimes pushed politicians towards classifying Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as “safe countries of origin” - whose citizens would not be able to claim asylum in Germany.
“The discussion alone in January about introducing the law led to a tangible reduction in new arrivals,” the internal BAMF report reads, claiming that public debate in Germany had “sent a message”.
Meanwhile, the government has engaged in frantic diplomacy in a bid to get all three Maghreb countries to take back rejected asylum seekers.
Battle over new law
BAMF officials' belief in the “deterrent effect” of the law will work in the government's favour, as Green Party politicians had demanded evidence that it would work before supporting the law in the Bundesrat (Germany's upper house of parliament).
But human rights activists say that the law will hurt thousands of people who could have good grounds to claim asylum.
“The new law will enable such a fast process that it will by necessity lead to wrong decisions,” Amnesty International wrote in a sample letter members could send to their MPs in February.
Labelling Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as safe countries of origin “would make it almost impossible to prove persecution,” the NGO added.
Lowest rate of asylum acceptance
Figures from the report show 26,036 new arrivals from North Africa in Germany in the whole of 2015.
But the number of those people who had their asylum applications granted was just 2.1 percent – the lowest rate for any country or region of origin.
In the first quarter of 2016 the ratio of successful applications has fell even further, to just 0.7 percent.
“In practice, [the new law] will lead to a minimization of the number of unjustified asylum applications from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia,” the report suggests.
It further argues that “two-thirds of cases [involving North Africans] are obviously unfounded”.

Under the EU's so-called Dublin rules, would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member-state of the bloc they enter, often the Mediterranean nations of Greece and Italy.
If asylum seekers have travelled on to other EU nations, they are to be returned to their first port of call.
But that requirement had been halted for Greece, which together with Italy has been the main point of entry for the more than one million immigrants who have entered the bloc since 2015 fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
A German interior ministry spokesman told AFP that Germany would reinstate the Dublin rule in two months' time and return newly arrived asylum seekers to their first EU port of call.
""In line with the recommendation from the European Commission, Germany believes that such transfers will be possible from March 15th,"" said the spokesman, Tobias Plate.
The EU recommended on December 8th that member states resume sending asylum seekers back to Greece from March next year, after such transfers were halted since 2011.
Athens has criticized the EU's assessment, with Migration Minister Yannis Mouzalas saying the current legal framework was ""unable to respond to the historic migration flows and leaves the burden to the member states that migrants first arrive in"".
German refugee relief group Pro Asyl has also raised concerns, warning that the measure would put the asylum system in Greece, a country still recovering from a deep debt and economic crisis, under further pressure.
Photos of refugees living in tents amid heavy snowfall in Greece caused outrage recently, and the European Commission on Monday called such conditions ""untenable"".

Germany's 2015 decision to open its doors to Syrian refugees, and to effectively suspend Dublin rules for them, brought 890,000 asylum seekers in that year alone.
But the move by Chancellor Angela Merkel has proved controversial, and the government has since sought to bring numbers down.
Last year, the figure dropped sharply to 280,000 arrivals, largely due to the closure of the Balkan overland route and a fragile EU-Turkey deal to limit the mass influx.
The plan to return asylum seekers to Greece could further slash new arrival figures, ahead of general elections expected in September, when immigration is set to figure as a key issue."

The 31-year-old Syrian man scaled a 30-metre crane on a building site in the Obersendling area of Munich on Monday, and refused to come down. He said that unless the government gave his family asylum, he would jump.
As night closed in, pressure mounted to get the man down. In temperatures of 31C, police were worried the man – who had had nothing to drink all day – would become dehydrated and faint, falling off the crane.
Over 50 police officers, including those from the special operations team, and 30 firemen were on hand to try and get the man down.
Despite the man's attempts to escape by climbing back and forth from one end of the machine to the other, officers managed to arrest him just before midnight at the top of the crane, using a large cherry picker.
“The man visibly defended himself,” a spokesman from the Munich police said on Tuesday morning. He faces either a prison sentence or a spell in a psychiatric ward, Die Welt daily newspaper reported.
According to a spokeswoman from the ministry of foreign affairs, his wife and child are currently in Cairo, Egypt and applied on Monday for a visa. Only when they arrive in Germany can they apply for asylum – a lengthy process which can often end in rejection.
Bavaria recently changed its asylum laws, causing uproar among immigrants and asylum activists in the state. Regional authorities also said they would be reducing food packages for asylum seekers, as well as financial support.

The policeman, named only as Andreas S., was the supervising officer on duty on January 7, 2005 when 21-year Jalloh, an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone, burned to death in his cell. The mattress to which he was shackled was set on fire with a cigarette lighter.
After a trial lasting nearly two years, the regional court in Magdeburg found Andreas S. guilty of negligent homicide by omission to act, as the senior officer failed to check on Jalloh even after repeated fire alarms went off.
The court heard how police officers even switched the alarm off several times before finally checking the jail cell and discovered Jalloh's body.
Andreas S. had failed in his duty to look in the cell and should have reacted immediately to the fire alarm, said chief state prosecutor Christian Preissner, reported the Der Spiegel magazine on Thursday.
The officer received a fine of €10,800, nearly twice the amount demanded by the public prosecutor. Earlier charges of bodily harm with fatal consequences were dropped during the course of the trial due to a lack of evidence.
Along with a fellow policeman, Andreas S. had already been acquitted of negligent manslaughter of Jalloh in 2008 by the Dessau-Roßlau regional court. He was charged again when the case was re-opened in January 2011 after the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) said the initial verdict had been flawed.
The chain of events could not have happened as was presented during the trial, the court ruled. Judges were unable to determine whether Jalloh set the fire himself, or how it would have been possible to do so, calling it a “substantial gap in the consideration of evidence.”
The pair said they had tied Jalloh's hands and feet because he had been violent after being arrested for harassing two women while under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
An exact sequence of events after Jalloh's arrest has not yet come to light. In a separate civil case brought against Andreas S., Jalloh's mother and brother claimed the victim must have already been unconscious when the fire broke out, because they said he could not have physically lit the fire when shackled by his hands and feet.
But the state prosecutor saw no evidence for this theory and rejected the plaintiff's application for further clarification from fire experts.
Although he denied any wrongdoing in what the defence described as a chain of unfortunate events, Andreas S. said he still deeply regretted not having been able to save Jalloh, reported the website of Der Spiegel magazine.
As the verdict was read out, human rights activists stood outside the court holding placards reading, “It was murder!”

""This number is a real challenge,"" de Maizière said at a a press conference announcing the new projections on Wednesday, adding that ""Germany is not overwhelmed by this development.""
""We need to find different, faster and more pragmatic ways to take action.""
The Ministry for Immigration and Refugees (BAMF) had previously forecasted a total of 450,000 for this year.
More people have applied for asylum in Germany so far this year than applied in total last year: Between January and July, 218,000 people applied for asylum - 124.8 percent more than during the same period last year.
In total, 200,000 people last year sought asylum for the first time in Germany.
The projections for this year are set to break the previous record of asylum seekers in the country of 440,000 in 1992.
Officials expect more immigrants to come in the second half of the year than in the first, many from the Aegean Sea and the Balkan Peninsula.
De Maizière reiterated at the press conference that the high proportion of people coming from the Balkan region - 40 percent - is ""unacceptable"" as there are others fleeing countries where they are in greater need or face worse violence and persecution.
More refugees, more money
The rising tide of immigrants seeking asylum in Germany has stirred up heated debate throughout the country, with many state and municipal leaders calling for more aid.
""The government must now say as soon as possible how it is going to contribute towards the long-term and structural costs of caring for refugees,"" North-Rhine Westphalia minister-president Hannelore Kraft told Spiegel Online.
""We don’t have the time to still be discussing this for months.""
De Maizière has said that the government should review the amount of benefits immigrants receive when they apply for asylum.
Some have pointed out that the amount asylum-seekers legally receive in benefits is equal to a police officer's salary in Kosovo or Albania.
A 'unified European solution'
Germany receives by far the greatest number of asylum-seekers in the EU and has seen dozens of attacks against refugee and asylum homes amid the influx of refugees, especially in far-right strongholds.
A home for asylum-seekers was set on fire in April in Tröglitz in Sachsen-Anhalt, destroying the roof of the building.
While also condemning attacks on refugees, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview last weekend that the immigration crisis would be a bigger challenge for Europe than Greece’s struggles.
In his speech on Wednesday, De Maizière also called on the EU to band together to address the immigration issue.
""There is not any one measure that will solve this, we must test all possibilities,"" he said. ""It is time for a European solution.""
A quota system to redistribute refugees, pushed by Merkel, has met with opposition from some member states.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday that Europe must work out a fairer way of sharing refugees rather than placing most of the burden on the shoulders of Germany and Sweden, which took in the highest number of asylum applicants per capita in the EU last year."

The protest - with the message ""Islam is part of Germany?"" written in yellow chalk on the pavement -- bore the logo of the far-right Identitarian Movement, which is under surveillance by Germany's domestic security service.
The pictures, candles and red roses were put there Thursday, hours after a German court jailed for life Hussein Khavari, an asylum seeker claiming to be from Afghanistan, for the 2016 rape and murder of a medical student.
An image of his victim, Maria Ladenburger, 19, was among those of four young women placed in picture frames on the pavement, together with 14 candles and the flowers, outside Merkel's office in the Baltic Sea town of Stralsund.
Merkel has faced a harsh backlash against her decision in 2015 to open German borders to a mass influx of mostly Muslim asylum seekers.
It has sparked the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the anti-Islam Pegida street movement, and the white pride Identitarian Movement.
Merkel this week further angered the extreme right by reiterating that, although Germany is historically mainly shaped by its Christian-Judaic tradition, today, with four million Muslims in the country, ""Islam has become part of Germany"".
Police told AFP they had removed the objects and were investigating whether a criminal offence had been committed.
The other photos were marked with the names Mia, Mireille and Keira.
A girl publicly identified only as Mia, 15, from the town of Kandel was stabbed to death in December in a supermarket by her former boyfriend, a refugee from Afghanistan believed to be around 20 years old.
Mireille, 17, was stabbed to death in March in Flensburg, and police have arrested as the chief suspect an 18-year-old Afghan asylum seeker.
And Keira, 14, was killed in a knife attack in early March in Berlin.
Initially false reports spread online pointing to an Afghan attacker, before a 15-year-old German fellow student confessed to the killing, police said.

The figures were published by the federal government in response to an inquiry from Ulla Jelpke, a lawmaker for the left-wing Die Linke party.
In the city state of Bremen the protection rate for refugees from Iraq was 96.4 percent in the first six months of 2017 - almost twice as high as in Berlin, where the rate was 50.3 percent. The report also stated that there were major differences in the decisions on applications from Afghans and Iranians.
The report moreover found 65 percent of asylum applications from Afghans were successful in Bremen, whereas 30.9 percent of Afghan asylum seekers were successful in Brandenburg. The success rate for asylum seekers from Iran moreover ranged from 37.6 percent in Bavaria to 85 percent in Bremen.
In contrast, the protection rates for Syrian asylum seekers in all of Germany's states was found to be over 99 percent.
Recognition rates describe the proportion of people who have received recognized refugee status in Germany and are allowed to remain in the country. Procedures decided on formal grounds, for instance when another EU country is found to be responsible for deciding on an asylum seeker's application, were not taken into account in the recognition rates.
But what could account for the imbalance across the country?
""There is no denying that there are very different ratios in the federal states without plausible explanations for this being apparent,” said Jelpke.
It isn't acceptable that Afghan refugees in Brandenburg or Bavaria, for example, have only about half the chances of obtaining protection status as they do in Bremen, she added.
Jelpke claimed to have heard there was a particularly negative decision-making practice in Bavaria with regard to Afghan refugees.
""It would be a worrying finding if the particularly negative political mood in Bavaria were to have a negative impact on the outcome of the asylum procedures for Afghan and other refugees,"" Jelpke said, adding that the reasons why asylum approval rates differed so greatly from state to state deserved further investigation."

As the trial began, human rights activists lit candles and called out, “It was murder!”
On January 7, 2005, 23-year-old Oury Jalloh, an asylum-seeker from Sierra Leone, allegedly set fire to a mattress with a cigarette lighter while his hands and feet were shackled to a jail cell bed. State prosecutors said he could have been saved if police had acted fast enough to get him out of the cell.
The now 50-year-old senior officer and a colleague said they had tied Jalloh's hands and feet because he had been violent after being arrested for drunkenly harassing women. When the fire alarm went off they allegedly turned it off several times before checking the jail cell.
But last January the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) ruled that the December 2008 decision by the Dessau-Roßlau regional court to acquit the police officer was flawed.
The chain of events could not have happened as it was presented during the trial, the court ruled. Judges were unable to determine whether Jalloh set the fire himself, or how it would have been possible to do so, calling it a “substantial gap in the consideration of evidence.”
The Magdeburg regional court will now take up the case to determine whether the senior officer was at fault for Jalloh's death, which sparked outrage among human rights activists in Germany.

Ali Bashar, 20, is believed to have strangled 14-year-old Susanna Maria Feldman after raping her in the German city of Wiesbaden.
He was detained early Friday in northern Iraq following an outcry in Germany after police hunting the fugitive admitted he had fled with his family.
""During interrogation following his arrest, the young man originally from Kurdistan confessed to killing the German girl,"" said Tariq Ahmad, police chief for the Dohuk area of Iraqi Kurdistan.
""He said that the two of them were friends but that they had a dispute, and that he killed her when the girl threatened to call the police,"" Ahmad said.
On Friday a senior official in the autonomous Kurdistan region told AFP that authorities were working to transfer Bashar quickly back to Germany to face trial.
That process could prove tricky as there is no official extradition treaty between Iraq and Germany.
The case has put renewed pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel's government over the decision to open Germany's borders at the height of Europe's refugee crisis in 2015, resulting in the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers.
Bashar arrived in Germany in 2015 along with his parents and five siblings.
He should have been deported after his request for asylum was rejected in December 2016, but he obtained a temporary residence permit pending his appeal.

History of violence
The case puts renewed pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel's government over the decision to open Germany's borders at the height of Europe's refugee crisis in 2015, which led to the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers over two years.
Far-right party AfD, which had railed against asylum seekers, swiftly seized on the case to push its point.

The party has called a protest Saturday under the banner ""That's enough"" while counter demonstrators are gearing up on the same day to rally against racism.
Bashar arrived in Germany in 2015 along with his parents and five siblings.

""The girl was raped by an Ali. There were four Alis living in the refugee home,"" said Stefan Mueller, West Hesse police chief.
'Revenge reflex'
The latest crime is reminiscent of another case involving the rape and murder of a student by an asylum seeker claiming to be from Afghanistan.
Hussein Khavari was in March sentenced to life in jail for the deadly attack on medical student Maria Ladenburger, 19, in October 2016.
Tagesspiegel daily pointed to a third case, in which a teenage girl was stabbed to death by her boyfriend, an Afghan asylum seeker.
""What is particularly sad in these three cases is also that the victims were interested, curious and ... tried to befriend (the newcomers).
""That's how integration usually works -- there are hundreds and thousands of examples in Germany. But now also three dead girls,"" it added in an editorial called ""Poison for society.""
Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper acknowledged that such cases spark a ""revenge reflex"" prompting people to seek the radical expulsion of refugees and the abolition of their rights.
""Barbarizing the law is not the answer to barbaric acts,"" it warned.

But as Sally McGrane reports, a dance project at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport is hoping to show the human fates trapped in a bureaucratic limbo.
In the first half of 2010, there were 15,579 applications for asylum in Germany, according the dry figures from the country's Interior Ministry. Betraying nothing of the lives behind the numbers, the information is conveyed in impassive black and white.
But the lis:sanga dance company wants to put faces to the figures. Its upcoming performance, “PASS,” a production that explores the relationship between a person's official status and deeper issues of identity, will take place in the transit area of Berlin's former airport Tempelhof on August 27 - 29.
Statistics and charts outlining the complexities of an asylum seeker's path in Germany will be presented in official documents included with the programme. But what happens on stage tells a story that the statistics can't: The fear, frustration, hope, anger, and sorrow involved in waiting to see if an application for legal status will be accepted, rejected, or put on hold.
For many of the 50 dancers performing, this is not an abstract question. Among the diverse group, who range in age from five to 75, there are a number of asylum seekers, including some arriving in Germany as unaccompanied minors fleeing war zones.
Many of the dancers have experienced the immigration system's bureaucracy from the inside, and the production draws, in large part, on their stories. Onstage, the dancers bring to life “the long wait,” as choreographer Lenah Strohmaier puts it, that asylum seekers and other immigrants undergo while their status – and fate – is determined.
Lis:sanga, which means ‘community' in the Congolese language Lingalá, was founded by the Berlin-born Strohmaier four years ago. A classically trained dancer and choreographer, she had spent several years working in India and Africa.
In 2003, she taught dance for the Berlin Philharmonic project in which “problem children” learned to dance to Stravinsky's ‘The Rite of Spring,' filmed as the documentary “Rhythm Is It!” Strohmaier, who personally helps guide many of the young asylum seekers in the group through Germany's bureaucratic jungle, started lis:sanga with dancers who had taken part in a dance, theatre and video production about war called “KRIEG” and who wanted to keep working together.
Since then, the group has struggled to find financing, but succeeded in staying together. “This is high-quality, serious art,” said Royston Maldoom, the British choreographer who, along with Sir Simon Rattle, led the Stravinsky project. “It's not dilettantish, it's not amateurish. At the same time, it's about community. It's art, and it's social work.”
In a very hands-on way, lis:sanga deals with integration – a hot topic both in Germany and Europe as a whole. “It doesn't matter what social status you have, here,” said Abra Kennedy, a 30 year-old Polish-Liberian who grew up in Berlin but held a Polish passport for much of her life. “We come here to dance. It doesn't matter how old you are, where you're from, what kind of car you drive, what you job is.”
The 20-year-old dancer Friedrich Pohl, who described his background as ‘totally German,' said that dancing with lis:sanga and working on projects like PASS were important for him on many levels. While gaining an awareness of problems he might not otherwise encounter is one benefit, what he takes away from the experience is more personal.
“The question is not just ‘what is it like for these people?'” he said. “But, what kind of city do I live in? Who are we, actually? And what kind of place do we live?”
PASS will play August 27, 28, and 29 at 8:30 pm at Berlin's Tempelhof Airport"

In a letter to the EU, Copenhagen cited the security risk posed by people fleeing deportation orders south of the border.
“The large number of illegal migrants and rejected asylum seekers who are awaiting deportation in Germany are a real security threat,” the Danish government wrote in a letter to the EU justifying the decision to extend border controls.
There is “a risk that terror groups will take advantage of their precarious situation,” the letter stated.
The Danish government implemented border controls in January 2016 and they have remained in place ever since. The decision overrides the Schengen Agreement of 1995 which abolished internal border controls in an area which currently encompasses 26 European states.
Although extensions to the measure have been granted several times, the border control had been scheduled to expire in November this year. But the government has now confirmed a further extension that will take the controls well into a third year.
Danish immigration minister Inger Støjberg wrote in a press statement that, despite the drop in numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Europe in comparison with a peak in late 2015, the borders of Europe’s countries were still under pressure.
“We cannot close our eyes to the serious terror threat against Denmark. The government therefore finds it necessary to maintain border control for now,” she said according to DR.
Germany also announced on Thursday that it was extending border controls on its border with Austria on Thursday.
German interior minister Thomas de Maizière cited a terror threat as the reason for the extension.
“A complete return to a Schengen area without border controls is only possible when an overall positive development allows for it,” he said.
The EU had wanted the border controls to be abolished by the end of the year. But Germany and Denmark are two of five countries seeking to change the rules to allow for border controls to stay in place for up to four years."

The CSU's regional faction in Bavaria's Wildbad Kreuth recommended copying the Swiss model, which had tightened asylum rules and thereby fast-tracked the procedure, the SZ reported. Faster asylum processes would not only “foster the acceptance of asylum decisions”, but also lead to “markedly better cooperation from asylum seekers than thus far”. Whoever has not been found to have the right to stay in Germany has to “quickly leave”, the CSU paper said. Processing an asylum request takes an average of eight months in Germany. The CSU's aim is to resolve cases classified as simple within a maximum of six weeks. Simple cases would include those where an asylum applicant comes from a so-called safe country, as well as those who were already registered in another European Union country before their application in Germany. Almost half of all asylum seekers fall und these two categories, the SZ said. But the draft resolution has no concrete proposal as to how exactly a fast-tracked procedure would look like, only stating that the asylum procedure should be accelerated via “targeted” execution within a “model project”, the SZ said. The CSU regional group believes replicating Swiss rules to Germany could mean that application submission and processing at the Federal Migration and Refugees Office (BMF) could be cut to seven days. An applicant would have a week to get injunctive relief, should the BMF deny the asylum application, bringing the matter to the courts, who should decide within six weeks, “ideally after a month”, whether the asylum seeker has the right to stay or not. Meanwhile, Bavaria's interior minister Joachm Hermann has also vowed to pursue deportation for those whose applications to stay in Germany have been denied. However, the paper comes at a tense time for migration issues in Germany, as the ranks of the xenophobic, anti-Muslim Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West swelled to to 17,500 before Christmas, from 200 in October. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly condemend the leaders of the movement in a New Year's address, saying they have have ""prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts"". Last month, the CSU had to backpedal after suggesting immigrants be obliged to speak German at home invited widespread mockery."

The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) recorded 93 attacks against refugee homes within the first three months of the year, according to a government response to a Die Linke (Left Party) enquiry seen by the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (NOZ). That would be about one attack per day.
This was about on par with the 106 incidents reported at the beginning of 2015, before the influx of refugees peaked in the autumn of that year.
Germany took in a record 890,000 asylum seekers in 2015. That same year, the number of attacks against refugee homes also hit record levels, with 1,031 incidents reported. That was more than five times the 199 cases in 2014. Last year also saw nearly 1,000 attacks against asylum facilities.
So far in 2017, 86 of the 93 reported cases were linked to right-wing radicals, according to the report.
Outside of asylum homes, 318 assaults were reported against asylum seekers or refugees, the vast majority of which were also linked to right-wing radicals. Another 25 attacks were against hired or voluntary refugee aid workers.
Forty-seven people in total were injured in violent attacks, including two children.
Die Linke politician Ulla Jelpke told NOZ that she saw no reason to give the “all-clear” when it comes to attacks against refugees.
“Violence and every day terror against refugees seem to have become normal in Germany,” Jelpke said.
“We should not get used to how refugees in this country are victims day-by-day of neo-Nazi or racist hostility and assaults.”
She added that her party has long demanded that the federal government create a more comprehensive campaign against this threat.
“But apparently the federal government has resigned itself to this ‘normality'.”"

arrived by plane back in Germany on Saturday after admitting raping and
murdering a teenage girl, Iraqi Kurdish officials and German media reports said.
""I am delighted the suspect sought by justice is back in Germany,"" said Interior Minister Horst Seehofer in a statement, adding he hoped Ali Bashar, 20, would now ""rapidly"" face trial.
Bashar is alleged to have strangled 14-year-old Susanna Maria Feldman after raping her in the German city of Wiesbaden.
He was detained in northern Iraq on Friday following an outcry in Germany after police hunting the fugitive admitted he had fled with his family.
Despite the absence of a formal extradition treaty between Iraq and Germany, he was put on a Lufthansa flight to Germany from the Kurdish regional capital Arbil, German media reports said.
He was expected to face a remand hearing after landing in Frankfurt and being transferred by helicopter to the police prefecture at nearby Wiesbaden, police said.
Bild daily said German police chief Dieter Romann, who has developed close relations with the Iraqi authorities, had personally travelled to Arbil to facilitate the handover.
The case has put renewed pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel's government over the decision to open Germany's borders at the height of Europe's refugee crisis in 2015, resulting in the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers.
Demonstrators held a minute's silence in cities across Germany on Saturday, notably in the teenager's hometown of Mainz.
On Friday, a senior official in the autonomous Kurdistan region had told AFP that authorities were working to transfer Bashar quickly back to Germany to face trial.
""During interrogation following his arrest, the young man originally from Kurdistan confessed to killing the German girl,"" said Tariq Ahmad, police chief for the Dohuk province of Iraqi Kurdistan.
""He said that the two of them were friends but that they had a dispute, and that he killed her when the girl threatened to call the police,"" Ahmad said.
Bashar arrived in Germany in 2015 along with his parents and five siblings. He should have been deported after his request for asylum was rejected in December 2016, but he obtained a temporary residence permit pending his appeal.
During this time, he got into trouble with the police on several occasions, including for fights, alleged robbery and possession of an illegal switchblade.
He was also among the suspects for the sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl living in the same refugee shelter.
Seehofer said Bashar's return was but ""small consolation"" for the victim's parents who he said were in his thoughts.
""For the state of our society it is important these crimes be cleared up and that the suspects be brought to justice,"" he added."

A government source said the charter flight was scrapped because diplomatic and consular staff, ""so shortly after the attack, have more important things to do than to deal with organisational matters"".
The bombing in Kabul's diplomatic quarter killed an Afghan guard at the German embassy and wounded two embassy staff, one of them German, the other one Afghan.

""In the next few days, there will be no return trips to Afghanistan,"" said an interior ministry spokesman, insisting however that deportations would continue after that.
Germany, Europe's most populous nation, has taken in over one million asylum seekers since 2015, the peak of the mass influx of mostly Middle Eastern refugees and migrants to the continent.
While it has generally granted safe haven to people from war-torn Syria, Germany is increasingly sending back Afghans, arguing that much of their country, where the German army has helped stabilization efforts for years, is safe.
Between December and March, Germany sent back a total of 92 Afghan nationals on several charter flights to Kabul, accompanied by over 300 police, according to government figures provided to parliament.
The deportation policy for war-torn Afghanistan has been highly controversial.
Some 200 students staged a sit-in blockade at a vocational school in Nuremberg on Wednesday and clashed with police who came to detain for deportation a 20-year-old Afghan student who had been in the country for over four years.
Police used batons and dogs, and three officers were injured, but they eventually managed to detain the student, reported public broadcaster BR, adding that the student speaks German and had been offered a job.
Refugee rights group Pro Asyl greeted the cancellation of Wednesday's flight but demanded that such deportations be scrapped for good, arguing that Afghans must not be sent back to ""a country that cannot protect civilians"".

					12:49 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Refugees offered swimming help after spate of drownings,"After an asylum seeker drowned in a Bavarian lake and three refugees died in swimming accidents in Hamburg at the beginning of June, authorities are looking for ways to help new arrivals stay safe.
Many refugees never learnt to swim back home. Now with the beginning of summer the risks this entails are rising – several refugees have already died in swimming accidents.
Many arrived for the first time in autumn and are experiencing their first summer in Germany.
Peter Astashenko, manager of the Bavarian Lifeguard Service, says that inexperienced migrants often do not correctly gauge the danger involved with bathing in ponds and rivers.
""They see that lots of people are in the water and that it looks fun. Suddenly the river bank slopes down, they slide into the water, panic, take a deep breath, and they drown,"" he says.
In 2015, 27 refugees lost their lives while swimming.
This season in Bavaria alone at least two refugees have already drowned.
A 17-year-old asylum seeker died in Bad Aibling when he paddled a surfboard onto a lake, the board tilted over, and he fell off.
""He fell into the water ten meters from the bank and didn't resurface,"" says Astashenko.
But this year the Bavarian Lifeguard Service is offering swimming courses for refugees, and language should be no barrier.
""Learning to swim is not a problem – you can even teach it with your hands and feet.""
But there is no state funding for courses.
""The state is not obliged to provide swimming lessons to asylum seekers,"" says a spokesperson for the Bavarian ministry for social affairs.
""There is no federal or country-wide programme for refugees being taught to swim – that is a matter for the local authorities,"" a speaker for the interior ministry of Schleswig-Holstein also explained.
Jürgen Steingreber runs a small indoor swimming pool in Harrislee, Schleswig-Holstein, where he teaches refugees to how to stay safe in the water.
""Their experiences on the Mediterranean Sea made many of them decided to learn to swim.
""I have refugees in my class who have had to witness children falling overboard and no adult being able to jump in after them – because none of them could swim,"" says Steingreber. ""That makes me terribly sad.""
Many of the refugees who come to North Rhine-Westphalia cannot swim either.
A speaker for the German Lifeguard Association (DLRG) says that members are always saying ""the number of swimmers [among refugees] seems to be low.""
In the past year, the DLRG counted 70 swimming-related deaths in North Rhine-Westphalia, three of whom were refugees.
Since last year they have taken steps to better educate swimmers, providing safety information in Arabic, English, French, Persian, Urdu, Russian, Albanian and more. In addition, some local DLRG societies are visiting refugee accommodation and offering swimming courses.
According to the DLRG, a general problem with teaching swimming is that there are ""fewer and fewer pools suitable for teaching.""
Refugees have also drowned while swimming in Hamburg: three on one midsummer weekend at the beginning of June.
The Safe Water Association on the Baggersee in Allermöhe has noticed that unattended underage refugees tend to swim in groups, but they are bad at judging their own strength.
According to Safe Water Association spokesperson Monika Retzlaff, swimming courses must be organized better: ""learning German is important, learning to swim is essential."""

					10:14 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,3 asylum seekers arrested for sexual assaults at music fest,"Police in Darmstadt have received 14 complaints of sexual assault from women who attended a music festival in the city over the weekend.
In total 26 women have made statements to police about cases of sexual assault at the Schlossgrabenfest, a free music festival in the central German town, a spokesperson told The Local.
Of the 14 reports, some involve several women and only after further investigations will it become clear how many of the women were victims of sexual assaults, police said.
Three of the women had gone straight to police who were on patrol at the four-day festival on Saturday night.
The women complained that they had been encircled and then sexually harassed by a group of men they described as being of south Asian appearance.
Police were then able to arrest three men at the site of the festival. All three were between the ages of 28 and 31 and are asylum seekers from Pakistan, a spokesperson confirmed to The Local.
By Tuesday afternoon, more women had made complaints of being sexually assaulted at the festival, describing a similar pattern to the assaults and also that the men appeared to come from south Asia.
There has also been one reported case of theft this year. But it is not clear whether it is connected to sexual assault. While the woman who reported it was assaulted, she only noticed that her purse was missing the next morning.
Last year there was only one reported crime that fell under the definition of a sexual crime, Darmstadt police told The Local. In that instance it was a case of exhibitionism.
“Up until this year we have had no cases of sexual assault where men surround women, like we have this year,” the spokesperson said.
The arrested men were handed sexual assault charges and later released from police custody.
Sexual violence in focus
Over New Year in Cologne and several other cities hundreds of women reported being sexually assaulted and robbed by groups of men at street parties.
Most of the men under investigation for the crimes come from north Africa.
Public debate after the attacks centred around the question of whether Germany's refugee policy -. whereby hundreds of thousands of people have entered the Federal Republic from countries with regressive attitudes on sexual equality - creates an increased danger for women in public places.
So far there have been few prosecutions and even no convictions over the New Year's sexual assaults in Cologne. The trial of an Algerian man collapsed earlier in May after the victim said she could not identify him.
Meanwhile, the state government in North Rhine-Westphalia is battling accusations that it ordered police officers to remove the word ""rape"" from their reports of the night's events.
MPs in Berlin also recently voted through a move to classify north African countries Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as ""safe countries of origin"" - making it much more difficult for their citizens to apply for asylum."

				14:24 CEST+02:00			 
					14:24 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Five things to know about the asylum deal struck by Merkel and Seehofer,"Chancellor Angela Merkel has struck a deal with rebels in her conservative camp to further close Germany's doors to asylum seekers. Here is an overview of what the agreement includes and the questions it throws up for other political players in Germany and Europe.
What has Merkel agreed?
Merkel's asylum pact with her hardline Bavarian CSU allies would set up a ""new border regime"" on the frontier with Austria.
Asylum seekers already registered in other EU nations would be held in ""transit centres"" while awaiting deportation.
The concept is similar to the ""extra-territorial"" zones of airports, where new arrivals have technically not yet reached national territory.
Before detainees can be deported, agreements must be hammered out with other governments.
Should those countries refuse, the conservatives want to persuade Austria to accept returned asylum seekers.
How many people are affected?
Numbers seeking asylum in Germany have fallen sharply from 2015-16 peaks, to 78,026 between January and May this year.
Of those arriving so far this year, some 18,349 - almost one in four - had an asylum claim already open in another country, according to media reports last month.
Despite the reduced flows, the CSU was determined to push through a policy it had called for unsuccessfully since 2015, hoping to sway voters ahead of a vital regional election in October.
Will Social Democrats agree?
""Transit centre"" camps were rejected by Merkel's centre-left coalition partners the SPD in 2015.
But SPD leader Andrea Nahles said Tuesday the new plan affecting smaller numbers was ""not the same case"" as at the height of the refugee crisis, when tens of thousands of people arrived each day.
Social Democrats are torn between their humanitarian instincts and the knowledge that many voters support tougher controls.
Exploding the coalition over migration so soon into its term would likely harm them at the polls in new elections.
But Nahles also warned there are ""cheques that risk bouncing"" in the deal's dependence on international agreements.
Will other countries accept returnees?
Being able to deport asylum seekers will depend on bilateral agreements to send them back to the EU nation where they first registered.
Such transfers were at the heart of a deal Merkel eked out at an all-night European leaders' summit last week.
Among the 16 countries named as having agreed by Merkel, several central European nations -- including Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- denied they were open to accepting returnees.
Meanwhile key migrant arrival country Italy, with its newly-elected populist government, did not appear on the list at all.
With Austria a key partner for implementing the conservative compromise, CSU Interior Minister Horst Seehofer must now persuade Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to take back asylum seekers.
""It seems to me that (Kurz) is interested in reasonable solutions,"" Seehofer said Tuesday after a phone call.
Vienna said it had not been consulted on the German plans and called for ""clarification"" from Berlin."

					14:30 CET+01:00				",AFP,Trial starts of Afghan accused of killing woman for converting to Christianity,"An Afghan asylum seeker went on trial in southern Germany on Tuesday accused of stabbing to death a compatriot mother-of-four because he was furious she had converted to Christianity.
Prosecutors charge that the 30-year-old, who was not named by authorities, murdered the woman in front of two of her children because she had turned her back on the Islamic faith.
The Muslim man allegedly used a 20-centimetre bladed knife to slash and stab the Afghan woman 16 times outside a supermarket in the southern city of Prien on Chiemsee lake on April 29th last year.
The case came at a time when the German public is torn over a mass influx of more than one million refugees and migrants since 2015, many from conflict-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
The 38-year-old woman had earlier asked the man whether he wanted to convert too, a request that was ""irreconcilable with his Muslim faith,"" prosecutors told the court in the city of Traunstein.
Two of the woman's children, aged five and 11, watched as the man allegedly killed their mother. Her two other children are adults.
Passers-by tried to stop the attacker by hurling a shopping trolley at him.
After his arrest, the man claimed he had acted out of frustration about his looming deportation as a rejected asylum seeker.
He was initially held in a psychiatric ward for about three months and then transferred to standard pre-trial detention.
The court has scheduled four days of hearings.

Edona has only known life in Germany.
Twenty months ago she was born in the Sauerland region in the west of the country, eleven days after her parents Eduart and Franga arrived from Albania seeking asylum.
On Thursday, Edona received an 11-page letter from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) explaining that she had one week to leave the country, Rhineland paper Der Westen reports after seeing the document.
To her family it seemed that Edona was being forced out of the country because she was born in the Bundesrepublik and therefore could not prove that she faced persecution at home.
“A concrete and individual fear of persecution could not be found for the applicant,” the letter stated, before explaining “persecution cannot exist due to the fact the applicant was born in Germany and at no point has been in Albania.”
If Edona does not comply, she will be deported, the letter warned.
Incompetence more than callousness
The case was picked up by local media as an example of the unbending hand of German bureaucracy. For the family, it would have meant all of them leaving, as sending their young daughter to Albania alone wasn't an option.
But the story turns out to be more of an example of the chaotic state of affairs at the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF).
A spokesperson for BAMF admitted to The Local that it was actually a mistake in sending out letters - the whole family had had their applications rejected, but for some reason only Edona had been informed,
""The fact that were are dealing with such a high number of asylum applications and that we have to come to so many decisions is to blame,"" BAMF's Christoph Sander said.
The law on minors is very he clear, he emphasized, saying that they cannot be deported separately from their parents.
BAMF is currently struggling under a backlog of around 370,000 asylum applications, the Rheinische Post reports, with a further 400,000 who arrived in 2015 still to even hand in their applications.
The federal office has taken on extra staff over the last few months to try and fight through the piles of paper work and hopes to decide on a further half a million cases in 2016.
Albania 'safe country of origin'
Since the summer of 2015 Germany has considered Albania a “safe country of origin”, meaning that an asylum seeker from there has to prove a specific threat against their person in order to claim refugee status.
Edona’s parents made an asylum application in 2014 which sought to prove that they are threatened with a blood feud from a neighbouring family.
According to Heinrich Nolte, the ex-mayor of the town in North Rhine-Westphalia where the family live, they are totally integrated.
Both parents have full time jobs and do not use state welfare, Nolte told Der Westen. Their six-year-old son Edjon goes to the local primary school, and Eduart sings in a men’s choir.
BAMF had not responded to a request for comment from The Local by the time of publication."

The 79,000 asylum applications lodged in July made it the month and “all time record” said Ministry for Immigration and Refugees (BAMF) president Manfred Schmidt.
At the end of August, BAMF is set to update its forecast for asylum-seeker numbers for 2015 with current estimates lying at around 450,000.
Schmidt said his priority was to speed up the ""return"" of asylum applicants from southeast Europe, so that their cases will been closed within six to eight weeks of their arrival.
""We will concentrate in the first place on Albania,"" he said.
Within a few weeks ""over 30,000 asylum applicants arrived from Albania with a protection rate of 0.1 percent,"" he said.
At the moment 209,000 asylum applications are being processed, of which 94,000 are from the Balkans and 40,000 are from Syria.
According to migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt, inefficiencies in the German asylum system are to blame for the backlog. In comparison with the rest of Europe, Germany has a much larger backlog than any other country, he said, with little sign that this is about to change soon.
In June the number of unfinished applications was twice as high as in 2014, with cases slowed by drawn-out revocation processes and ""Dublin"" examinations – investigations into where asylum-seekers first entered the European Union.
Revocation processes take place three years after an initial asylum request has been granted and look at whether the individual still meets the conditions for asylum to be extended.
“In Germany there are as many open applications as in the rest of Europe put together,” said Thränhardt.

					13:23 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,This is why hardly any North African people were deported in 2016,"A look into why it is so hard for Germany to deport rejected asylum seekers from North Africa.
When the first charter plane for rejected Tunisian asylum seekers took off in Leipzig on April 8th 2016, the German Interior Ministry hoped that discussion over faster deportations to North Africa would start to quieten down.
Shortly before, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière had agreed to work with the Tunisian government and set up chartered planes with a maximum of 25 people per flight.
By the end of the year, there were just five further flights, with an average of 12 Tunisians on board.
But there are many more asylum seekers from North Africa who have been rejected by Germany: the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) turned down the applications of 8,363 people from the region between January and November last year, while during the same time frame, 368 people were deported.
This is because there are various barriers in the way of enforcing deportation orders, the Interior Ministry explains.
Of the more than half a million rejected asylum applicants, 52,000 were issued orders to leave the country. Most who are denied asylum receive temporary status as “tolerated”, due for example to health reasons. In other cases the country of origin will not accept the person, or the rejected applicant was missing identification documents - this is the most common reason, according to the government.
The main suspect in the Berlin truck attack, for example, could not be deported as he should have been because Tunisia did not issue the necessary paperwork until after the attack.
Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed told DPA recently that his government had followed deportations procedures and cooperated as usual.
According to an employee of the Moroccan interior minister who works on such cases - and who wished to remain anonymous - identification problems often arise when immigrants throw away their passports and pretend to be Syrian. In the last month, German and Moroccan agencies exchanged data about illegal immigration by Moroccans, and now more people can be sent back.
The procedure is also quite time intensive. Often consular authorities from asylum seekers' reported homelands will meet the refugees in Germany and investigate whether they are actually their citizens.
De Maizière wrote to his colleagues in state interior ministries that agencies must make sure that “the person concerned who must leave the country is also actually present”.
Immigration researcher Martin Zillinger from Cologne University said problems arise on both sides of the Mediterranean.
“There are authorities in the North African countries who - perhaps also out of solidarity for the immigrants - have no interest in working particularly quickly,” Zillinger said.
“We in Germany and the EU also have created a situation where we counteract the possibility for deportation by compelling people to disappear or go along illegally,” he added, explaining that many refugees throw away their passports because they see that they only have a chance to stay if they become “tolerated” or have a residence permit due to a lack of ID.
De Maizière and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel recently suggested that Germany cut development aid to countries that do not take back their citizens. But at the same time, North African countries feel they have been forsaken.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told DPA that there is a lack of support from European countries. Of the 1,373 rejected asylum seekers from his country, just 18 were recently deported. There is no attitude of trying to block things, he said, “as long as people voluntarily want to go back, we will also take them”.
In Tunisia, hundreds protested on the streets last weekend over topics including deportations from Germany. Many fear that Isis terrorists like Amri will return, while others do not want to take back the criminals rejected by Germany.

The sharpening of deportation rules comes two months after Anis Amri, a young Tunisian man, drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas market on December 19th, killing 12 people.
Amri had been told to leave the country and had been briefly detained in August 2016, but was later released when authorities couldn't confirm his identity.
The refugee organization Pro Asyl criticized the new draft law, describing it as “a brutalization of deportation policies.”
Figures released by Statista from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) show that at the end of 2016, there were a total of 207,484 people living in the country who had been ordered to leave - a number roughly equivalent to the population of Mainz, state capital of Rhineland-Palatinate.

North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state, had by far the highest number of people on its deportation list. With 62,906 living in the state who have been told to leave, 30 percent of the national total live in NRW.
NRW became the focal point of media discussions on deportations after groups of men of North African appearance sexually assaulted women in the state's largest city, Cologne, over New Year 2015-16.
Many of the men reportedly arrived in Germany over the preceding 12 months and applied for asylum, despite the fact that asylum application from citizens of the North African states of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco are almost never granted.
The state with the second largest number of people waiting to be deported was Baden-Württemberg, at 26,769.
Germany's 16 states are responsible for the deportation of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants who live in their administrations.
Bavaria - Germany's second largest state with a population of about 13 million - had proportionally far fewer people waiting to be deported, at 16,587. The Bavarian state government is arch conservative and has pledged to ensure security in its borders through quick deportations of criminal asylum seekers.
National capital Berlin, with a population of 3.5 million, had only slightly fewer people waiting to be deported, at 15,166."

A ministry spokeswoman said the federal migration and refugee agency (BAMF) ""will quickly take the necessary steps to bring back"" the 20-year-old identified only as Nasibullah S.
The young man had been flown to Afghanistan along with 68 other failed asylum seekers in early July despite an ongoing legal appeal against his deportation.
Germany's hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has repeatedly challenged Chancellor Angela Merkel's more liberal stance on migration issues, admitted that ""apparently there were bureaucratic mistakes made at the BAMF"" in its handling of the case.
The BAMF has said that it believed Nasibullah S. filed his appeal against being returned to Afghanistan too late under German law and thus ordered his deportation.
Seehofer, who has spearheaded a drive to rid Germany of rejected asylum seekers, came under fire last week with a quip about the deportation flight with 69 Afghans on board falling on his 69th birthday.
One of the other returnees, a 23-year-old man, committed suicide the day after Seehofer's press conference and outraged opposition politicians called for the minister's immediate resignation.
In a further controversial case, a German court last Friday ordered that a man who allegedly worked as a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden be returned only hours after his deportation to Tunisia, saying the expulsion was illegal as he risks torture there.
And last month, an Afghan man who was allowed back into Germany after he was illegally expelled from the country was officially granted asylum, at the end of a long odyssey through the courts.
Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the bloody conflict in Afghanistan that has been raging since 2001, making the issue of deportations from Germany and other European countries highly controversial.
In 2016, Berlin signed a deal with Kabul to repatriate Afghans who had failed to obtain asylum, and began expelling people in December of that year.
So far this year, 148 Afghans have been deported from Germany, official figures show.
Some of the deportees have spent most of their lives living outside of Afghanistan.
More Afghans are likely to be deported after Merkel's shaky three-party coalition agreed this month on a tougher migration policy that will reduce the number of asylum seekers in the country."

The largest number of respondents (38 percent) agreed that the upper limit should be set at a conservative 200,000 asylum seekers per year.
Twenty one percent of people meanwhile said that Germany should take in no asylum seekers at all, while 17 percent said there should be an upper limit of half a million and just 3 percent wanted it set at a million.
In 2015 around 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in Germany, with the majority arriving in the second half of the year.

Asked about their country’s ability to integrate the asylum seekers who are arriving from countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, most Germans expressed a belief that this is possible.
But 52 percent said it would only be possible with a limit on the number of people arriving. Fifteen percent said it could succeed even without a limit.
Twenty-nine percent said it wouldn’t succeed at all.
In terms of the fears they have about how the refugee influx could damage Germany, the most commonly expressed anxiety was that the country would have to go into debt, with 77 percent believing this would be an issue.
Almost two-thirds of people meanwhile worried the jump in population would make it harder to find housing, while 62 percent worried that it would result in more criminality.
On the other hand only 37 percent of respondents said that refugees would have a detrimental effect on prosperity in Germany.
For the poll 1,025 people were surveyed between February 16th and 18th 2016.

Germany took in almost 900,000 asylum seekers last year - about half from conflict-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - and put them up in shelters countrywide, including hostels, shops, sports gyms and army barracks.
Tensions have at times flared in the often overcrowded facilities, where refugees typically have little space or privacy and face the frustration of months-long waits to have their cases heard.
While some shelters have seen mass brawls between members of different national, ethnic and religious groups, in others women and children have faced a heightened threat of sexual abuse, say aid workers.
Police though have not explained the background to the rape or how the suspects knew the teenager."

P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } Asylum seekers coming from countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will find it increasingly difficult to be able to live legally in Germany, the interior ministry bill said. Despite war in the Balkans ending in 1999, tens of thousands of people from the area still seek asylum in Germany. But under the bill Germany will mark these states as “safe countries of origin” meaning asylum requests can be rejected without a reason. The aim is to “process requests from nationals of these states more quickly so that their stay in Germany can come to a faster end,” the draft bill said, as seen by the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper. Doing so should “shorten the time they require German social support thus reducing the number of people applying for asylum for economic reasons,” said the bill, adding that authorities should aim to decide on an application ""within a week”. At the beginning of February, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière made his views clear on Balkan asylum seekers. “People from these countries are not politically persecuted, so their applications have to be quickly and clearly decided upon,” he said. Last year the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees listed 22,495 asylum requests from people from Balkan states. In January and February 2014 there were 6,112 requests – making up 27 percent of all first-time applications.

Pouria Nourmohammadi, 19, one of two Iranian men on the missing flight to Beijing was travelling to Frankfurt to seek asylum and meet his mother, Malaysian police said on Tuesday. But along with 29-year-old Seyed Hamid Reza Delavar, who was reportedly heading for Sweden, he was travelling on a stolen passport. Germany’s Office for Migration and Refugees told The Local that nine percent of asylum seekers show them ID documents which are forged or tampered with – the equivalent of 644 documents last year - although a spokeswoman said they were unable to say whether all tampered passports had been stolen. As Interpol announced on Tuesday that the two men travelling on stolen passports were Iranian citizens intent on seeking asylum in Europe, the head of the international police body complained that not all airports ran passengers' passport details through its database, which was created in 2002. “As we work to identify any criminal network which may have facilitated the theft of the passports used by these individuals to travel internationally, it remains of serious concern to Interpol that approximately four out of every 10 international passengers are not being screened against our SLTD database, and this should be a worry for us all,” said Ronald Noble. The statement further noted that ""terrorists, murderers and war criminals have previously been identified by Interpol as having travelled internationally using stolen passports"".
Interpol also said the two men in question likely had no terrorism connections. In Sweden, the reported destination of the 29-year-old Iranian, police passport expert Högback noted that certain Swedish citizens' propensity to lose their passports over and over again certainly piqued the authorities' curiosity, but that the police had no power to intervene. ""There are individuals who lose their passports several times a month, in which case it's likely that they sell them illegally,"" Högback told The Local.

De Maizière said that many of his European colleagues believe Germany's standards for asylum-seeker benefits are very high.
""We need to have a debate about the standards of human dignity and benefits,"" De Maizière told broadcaster ZDF's evening news programme.
The Interior Minister said that more than 40 percent of asylum-applicants in Germany come from west Balkan countries - some of which have recently been declared ""safe"" by the federal government, meaning asylum can't be granted for their citizens - and have no chance of being granted refugee status.
The amount asylum-seekers legally receive in benefits is equal to a police officer's salary in Kosovo or Albania, he added.
But these benefits cannot be arbitrarily reduced. The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that social assistance benefits - known as Hartz IV - constitute a fundamental right that also applies to asylum-seekers.
""With regards to benefits, we can also still do something that protects human dignity,"" De Maizière said.
He added that country must be prepared for a much higher number of refugees than previously expected, though he would not yet give an estimate.
""How high the prediction is, that is something we will discuss with the states and next week I will tell the public,"" the minister explained.
De Maizière's own family are descendants of Huguenot Protestants, who fled from France in the 17th century to seek asylum in Prussia due to forced Catholic conversions in France.
'No time to lose'
Various state and local leaders have called for radical reforms to the country's asylum policies.
""The unbridled increase of the streams of refugees with possibly 600,000 people this year shows that we urgently need to reform the organizational, staffing and financial resources from scratch,"" Gerd Landsberg, Chief Executive for the Association of Cities and Towns, told the Rheinische Post newspaper on Friday.
""We have no time to lose. We especially need to replace the emergency tent facilities with solid structures as soon as possible, before the winter comes.""
Germany receives the most asylum seekers of any country in the European Union with 300,000 new applicants since January 2015.
Debate has worn on among politicians and refugee assistance programmes about how best to handle the growing population.

A 51-year-old Dutch man who headed a refugee shelter in Finnentrop-Heggen is accused of raping a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker at least four times, German media reported on Monday.
The woman also stayed in his home between January and March of this year, according to Der Westen. She became pregnant and had an abortion, according to broadcaster WDR. After she aborted the fetus, a DNA test confirmed that the suspect was the father.
The 51-year-old also had 19 prior convictions, including for dealing stolen goods, producing drugs, forgery and also one conviction for a sexual crime, according to Der Westen. Most of the crimes were committed in the Netherlands, but some were also committed in Belgium and Germany.
He then became the head of a refugee shelter in Finnentrop-Heggen and was responsible for 200 people living there.
“Fundamentally it is of course the case that people in such facilities are particularly at the mercy of the local staff, who are often not adequately trained or qualified, or were not adequately reviewed before - as is the case in the present case, but also in many other cases,” Marie Frank from advocacy group Pro Asyl told The Local.
“One must only think about the many scandals regarding security firms at refugee shelters.”
The shelter was run by a company based in Essen called European Homecare, which was hit by a scandal in 2014 when it emerged that security guards at a Burbach home operated by the firm had bound and abused a refugee, taking photos of the incident.
The company then fired its subcontractor that had been responsible for security contracts and stepped up its checks of guards. But then seven other security guards - also in Burbach - were found harassing foreigners online, Der Westen reports.
A local government spokesman deflected blame for hiring the suspect in the rape case, telling Der Westen that “selection of staff is done by the company”, referring to European Homecare.
Though neither Ministry for Families nor the Federal Criminal Agency (BKA) provide figures on the incidence of sexual abuse in German refugee camps, there is anecdotal evidence of large numbers of incidents.
""So far, we only know about individual cases. But we assume that there is a number of unreported cases,"" family ministry spokesperson Verena Herb told The Local in March.
""Many of the women in the camps are scared to speak out about what is happening - many of them are for example scared to be sent back home because of it.""
In February, a group of refugee women at a shelter in Cologne reported being spied on while naked and blackmailed into sex by security personnel.
The German Ministry for Families said in March that it would make up to €200 million available to fight sexual abuse at refugee homes.
Living conditions and protections for refugees in Germany have been criticized, including through investigations by the European Commission."

The Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) as well as broadcasters WDR and NDR first reported on the plans on Sunday, quoting the Interior Ministry as saying that the proposal was “for better enforcement of departure orders”.
Currently the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) is instructed to only collect cell phone data from refugees' phones with the person's consent.
The new proposal would create a legal basis so that BAMF would not have to gain this consent. Collecting mobile phone data has thus far only been done when there is suspicion about a possible crime, and only with the permission of a judge.
Authorities explain that refugees sometimes give out fake personal details in order to avoid deportation, or to cheat the system for more social benefits.
The media reports emphasize how wide the government could cast their net under such a proposal, with the Interior Ministry estimating that last year between 50 to 60 percent of asylum seekers could have been eligible to have their data collected - that's about 150,000 people.
The media reports also state that BAMF field offices have equipment and software to allow for 2,400 data storage devices to be culled per day.
Around 213,000 asylum seekers have “enforceable departure orders” in Germany, according to foreign registration figures. But there are a number of reasons that often delay or hinder deportations, such as when a country of origin denies that someone is their citizen, or delays taking them back - as happened in the case of the Berlin Christmas market attack suspect.
The minister-president of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, has said that cell phone seizures should remain limited to cases of doubt about the identity of an individual. It is important “to also use sources of information that you have”, he added.
SZ reports that the collection of cell phone data by immigration authorities has been allowed in principle since a legal amendment in 2015. At the time, the German upper house of parliament (Bundesrat) voiced concerns that collecting data from phones or laptops could be problematic because it could “harm the inviolable core principle of private life”.
The December Berlin Christmas market attack, however, has raised more security concerns, with the German government since proposing a slew of new, tougher measures.
The main suspect, Anis Amri, had been investigated by intelligence services in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) on suspicion of planning a terror plot and had been categorized as a security threat.
But when he moved to Berlin in February 2016, a lack of communication between security services in the two states appears to have contributed to him being able to escape the attentions of police.
He had also been told to leave the country in June 2016, but remained free in the months that Germany tried to get official documents about him from his home country of Tunisia."

Police closed off key streets to keep the groups separate and avoid potentially violent clashes. The situation was ""markedly more heated than in recent weeks,"" a police spokesman told news agency dpa. Dresden has seen successive demonstrations over what participants regard as excessive influence of Islam in Germany and Europe. Marches were called by the so-called Pegida Alliance, an abbreviation of the German for ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West"". The issues of asylum seekers and Islam have fuelled tensions in a number of cities this autumn. Numerous demonstrations took place against what participants regard as excessive influence on society by Islamic communities.
Some protests specifically targetted the Salafist branch of Islam and bids by some members to introduce aspects of Sharia law in German cities. Forty-five people, including 44 police officers, were injured last month in Cologne during clashes with right-wing groups marching under the banner ""Hooligans against Salafists"". Growing activism against Islam has also translated into hostility towards asylum seekers in Germany, many of whom come from Islamic countries.

The figures released by the Interior Ministry show how hard it is to come to accurate conclusions about the number of refugees currently in Germany and where exactly they reside.
Moreover, they shed a light on the bureaucratic nightmare the German government faces in trying to keep tabs on the more than a million new residents of the country who arrived in 2015.
The figures were published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung after Die Linke (the Left Party) made an official request in the German parliament.
Officials admitted in response that 13 percent of people who were registered as asylum seekers in 2015 didn't arrive at the shelter they were assigned to.
With roughly 1.1 million people registered last year in the ‘Easy System' computing system - that means more than 130,000 people did not arrive where they were supposed to be placed.
The Interior Ministry says that some asylum seekers may have travelled on to other countries while others may have “slipped into illegality.”
Previously the Ministry has suggested that many also go and stay with family members who already live in Germany.
The figures also show how the Dublin Accord - whereby asylum seekers are sent back to the EU country in which they were first registered - has fallen apart over the previous 12 months.
Whereas in 2014 Germany was sending every fifth asylum seeker back to the country where they had entered the EU, in 2015 this ratio had dropped to one in every ten.
While Germany put in 45,000 requests for other countries to take back asylum seekers, this only took place in 3,600 cases. At the same time other countries sent 3,000 refugees back to Germany - meaning that the Dublin Accord only made a net difference to Germany of 600 refugees.
“The Dublin system is not only a bureaucratic nightmare, it's a human one too - it creates uncertainty for refugees in need of protection and it demands an enormous amount of manpower at the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees and in the courts,” Ulla Jelpke of Die LInke told the SZ."

The announcement by Kurz in Berlin after talks with German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer marks a shot across the bow at Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is trying to pull together a deal for EU cooperation on placing asylum seekers.
Seehofer - who is locked in an open migration feud with Merkel that is threatening the stability of her coalition government - said that he and his far-right Austrian and Italian counterparts, Herbert Kickl and Matteo Salvini, had formed their alliance this week.
He said their cooperation would extend to ""issues of security and terrorism"" but did not offer specifics on what it would entail.
Kurz, whose country assumes the EU's rotating presidency on July 1st, said he welcomed the ""good cooperation that we want to develop between Rome, Vienna and Berlin"".
""I think it marks very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe,"" Kurz told reporters. ""We believe an axis of the willing is needed to fight illegal migration.""
Merkel has firmly rejected a plan put forward by Seehofer to turn back at German borders any asylum seeker already registered in another EU country. She argues that her country should not go it alone while Europe searches for a common policy.
Seehofer has won support from Salvini, who on Monday flatly refused to allow a rescue vessel carrying hundreds of migrants to dock.
Despite the gulf between them, Seehofer insisted Wednesday that he was committed to striking a compromise with Merkel this week, although what shape it would take appeared completely unknown.
""We will definitely find a solution,"" he said.
Merkel was re-elected for a fourth term in September but saw her ruling majority depleted by voter unease over the influx of more than one million asylum seekers in 2015-16.
Kurz won the chancellery last year in an alliance with the far-right, vowing to tackle illegal immigration, an issue that also propelled a populist alliance to power in Italy.
The Austrian centre-right leader said in Berlin Wednesday he was counting on the backing of his tough line during his EU presidency from countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark.
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also consistently either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under a contested EU quota system."

The 27-year-old man, who was not named, was taken into custody Wednesday in the northern town of Strande after refugees who survived the horrific voyage recognized him, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in nearby Kiel told AFP.
He said the suspect allegedly belonged to a group of people-smugglers trying to bring a group of 320 asylum seekers to Greece from Turkey by boat.
However several of the potential passengers refused to board the vessel on the grounds that it looked unsafe, leading the smugglers to ""force them at gunpoint"".
While at sea, one of the smugglers allegedly handed the wheel to an asylum seeker and the boat sank within an hour.
Fifty-four people perished, having had ""no chance"" of reaching shore, the spokesman, Axel Bieler, said.
Prosecutors believe the 27-year-old was key in organizing the deadly journey.
""He arranged the contacts, he put together the logistics with his accomplices,"" Bieler said.
The suspect, who himself came to Germany in 2015 and applied for asylum, has received a limited residence permit along with his wife and child.
In a hearing before a judge after his arrest, he denied the charges against him, Bieler said.
He faces between three and 15 years in prison if convicted.
Migration to Europe soared in 2015, as people desperate to flee the worsening conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan risked their lives attempting the dangerous crossing.
Germany took in nearly 900,000 people that year alone.
Its courts have recently convicted several people-smugglers as part of a wider crackdown.
Last week, two Romanian men were handed prison sentences in the southern city of Passau for putting the lives of hundreds of asylum seekers at risk while transporting them at the height of the 2015 influx.
In a separate case in the southern town of Traunstein, three alleged people-smugglers went on trial last week accused of bringing hundreds of refugees to Germany in late 2015 and early 2016.

According to the police report, two men have been charged with sexually molesting five girls between the ages of 12 and 14 in a swimming pool on Saturday.
It is reported that the men, 23 and 34, were ""southern-looking"", and police later confirmed them to be asylum seekers living in Bad-Oldesloe.
The two men are accused of having touched and abused the girls underwater at a swimming pool in the small town, which lies around 50 kilometres northeast of Hamburg. After the incident the girls reported the men to a lifeguard.
The lifeguard then ejected the men from the pool and called the police. They are now being charged by police for the molestation.
This isn't the first time that there have been such complaints at German pools. Last year a swimming pool in Bornheim banned male asylum seekers from swimming there after a number of complaints of sexual harassment were made.
Swimming pools in Munich also published leaflets in Arabic, French, Pashto, and Somali aimed at reducing sexual abuse in swimming pools. The leaflets included a picture of an outstretched hand reaching towards a woman in a bikini with a big red cross over it."

					11:28 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,Berlin may not deport victims of far-right violence,"The capital city is considering allowing rejected asylum seekers the chance to stay in Germany if they are victims of far-right violence, as a way of sending a ""strong signal"" to perpetrators of racist crimes.
Berlin's interior minister Andrea Geisel told newspaper Tagesspiegel on Sunday that the city is looking into the legal possibilities of such an exemption, after the surrounding state of Brandenburg became the first state to present a similar rule.
“I find an exemption, as Brandenburg has introduced, to be a strong political signal to those who believe that ‘whoever wants to chase refugees out of the country must attack them',” Geisel told Tagesspiegel.
“To this I say: no. Whoever is a victim of far-right violence will enjoy our double protection and will not be deported.”
Brandenburg became the first state to declare it would offer such protection after its interior ministry called on relevant immigration authorities to use their discretion accordingly.
Rejected asylum applicants who are witnesses to or victims of far-right attacks would not be told to leave until at least the end of the investigation or trial of the crime.
In particularly serious cases, the victims would be allowed to stay after the end of the trial, as a form of atonement.
“[Brandenburg] has a great public interest in making it clear to suspected perpetrators of violent acts that their victims will have justice through a solid residence and the opposite of what the perpetrators intended will happen,” Brandenburg officials wrote in a statement about the exemption.
But these exemptions would not be made for asylum seekers who had committed crimes, or who are deemed to pose security risks.
Geisel noted that Berlin must still review whether the exemption could be implemented in the same way as in Brandenburg. Previously Berlin interior administrators had said that such a rule would not be necessary since there are already existing discretionary powers in Berlin for victims of serious crimes.
Germany has seen a sharp uptick in hate crimes and attacks on refugee homes in recent years as the country has taken in record numbers of asylum seekers. Previously media reports showed that federal authorities had recorded nearly 800 crimes against refugee homes in 2016 up to October.
In 2015, there were more than 1,000 such crimes."

In March 2014 79.2 percent more people applied for asylum than in the same month the previous year, according to the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF). A total of 11,280 people sought asylum in the country during the last month, 9,839 of whom were applying for the first time. In March 2013 the number of new asylum applicants was only 5,579. Most of the asylum seekers in March 2014 came to Germany from Syria (1,786 people) and Serbia (1,386 people), according to the BAMF report released on Wednesday. There were also just over a thousand people who came to Germany from Afghanistan and around the same number from Macedonia. ""Asylum applications have in fact been rising steadily since 2009,"" a spokeswoman for BAMF told The Local, adding that the number had almost tripled within a few years. ""The reasons are varied,"" she said. ""We continue to see many cases of asylum applications from countries like Afghanistan, where the situation hasn't improved. But of course there are new crisis hotspots like Syria too."" There has also been an increase in asylum applications from Chechnya.""Political persecution is the most common reason,"" she said.
The BAMF said 2,098 were granted asylum under their rights as a refugee as per the Geneva convention, around 19 percent of the total applicants for the month. Meanwhile 632 gained ""subsidiary protection"" under EU guidelines and 160 were granted ""deportation bans"" allowing them to stay in the country on the grounds of their Geneva Convention right not to be deported to a nation where they would be in danger due to race, nationality or political views. Overall in the first quarter of 2014, 37,820 people applied for asylum in Germany compared to 21,520 in the same period last year, an increase of about 76 percent. However, the majority of asylum applications are still either rejected or ""otherwise settled"" (this is usually a matter of the applicant cancelling the asylum request because the circumstances at home have changed). In the first quarter of 2014 so far, 31 percent of applicants were refused asylum and 45 percent were ""otherwise settled"". SEE ALSO: Germany tops the charts for asylum applications"

					16:32 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,Analysis: Is one man about to collapse German politics as we know it?,"On Sunday the Christian Social Union (CSU) are set to meet to vote on whether to back Horst Seehofer in his plan to turn asylum seekers back at the German border. If Seehofer follows through, the move will have incalculable consequences for German politics.
What is the problem?
Germany's conservative parties are a little like two crime families who work together as long as one stays off the other's turf. This has worked out pretty well over several decades as the CSU have sat in power in Munich, while the CDU dominated politics on the federal level.
There were unwritten rules to their collaboration though. Whereas the mafia (at least in the films) drew a line at bringing drugs into the country, the unspoken code of German conservative politics was: no immigrants (or at least, not too many).
When Angela Merkel decided not to close the borders as thousands of refugees crossed the border in 2015 she broke this rule. Ever since then the ageing boss of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, has been seething. Throw into the mix a hot-headed upstart who is challenging Seehofer's grip on power in the CSU and you not only have the ingredients for a ropy Hollywood movie, but also for real-life German politics.
Now Interior Minister, Seehofer has loudly declared that Germany has been too soft in applying EU law on asylum seekers. He was set to publish an “asylum masterplan” a little over two weeks ago, which would have given him the power to stop migrants coming into the country.
But Merkel bluntly rejected the proposal.
Ever since then conservative politics in Germany has been in a state of meltdown. Seehofer claims he can't understand why Merkel rejects what he describes as a technicality, while Seehofer has been accused of putting Bavaria's interests above those of Germany and Europe.
And with state elections coming up in Bavaria in the autumn, there is every reason to believe that Seehofer and the young upstart Marcus Söder aren't thinking about much else other than what goes on inside their own territory.
The upshot of the controversy was that Seehofer gave Merkel two weeks to find a deal on migrants with other EU countries, otherwise he would shut the border whether she liked it or not.
If he goes ahead, decades of peace between the conservative clans will come to an end. Seehofer will force Merkel to fire him and their Bundestag alliance will be over. A pitched battle for power will commence in the build up to Bavaria's autumn elections. Things could get very messy.
Time is up
Seehofer's deadline is up this Monday. On Sunday, the most important members of the CSU will come together in Munich to discuss what steps they'll take next.
In the meantime, Merkel has been wringing every last inch of guile out of her political neckerchief in an attempt to get European deals signed that stave off the threat of a rebellion from down south.
The first success was announced early on Friday morning when she managed to secure a surprise agreement between the 28 EU member states on migration.
The states agreed to set up closed migrant centres, which would be hosted on a voluntary basis. People rejected for asylum would “be returned” from these centres, while genuine refugees would be taken in by states on a voluntary basis.
But the agreement was thin on the ground on details on the crunch issue for Seehofer, so-called “secondary migration”, a phrase which refers to migrants moving around within the EU. The agreement only contains the vague statement that “member states should call on all necessary internal lawful and administrative processes in order to prevent such movements, and should collaborate closely on this issue.”
Then later in the day Merkel could announce bilateral deals with Spain and Greece, committing them to taking migrants who German border police detain at the border. The big one, Italy, remained elusive, though. Most asylum seekers who reach Europe come through Italy - and Merkel has been unable to get Rome to commit to a bilateral deal.
So will Seehofer pull the trigger?
One fundamental reason why the CSU have been so agitated is that another organization has been aggressively muscling in on their patch. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) have managed to be more populist, more anti-immigrant and more reactionary than the Bavarians - and in doing so have stolen a whole heap of business from Seehofer and his gang.
Polling shows that the AfD are on course to win 14 percent of the vote in Bayern, a result which will drag the all-mighty CSU down to their worst score since the 1950s. The days of absolute power will be over.
So the temptation is clearly there: pull the trigger and show the Bavarian beer halls that you don't take orders from Berlin.
If only it were that simple, though. Were Seehofer to close the border to migrants, thus pulling down the government and ending the alliance with the CDU, Merkel's party would swiftly move onto his patch.
And polling shows that many Bavarians are secretly crying out for freedom from the yoke of one-party rule.
A poll released on Friday by Forsa showed that 54 percent of Bavarians who voted CSU at the last election would swap to the CDU if they had the choice. That poll suggested that the CDU would win 33 percent of the vote in a Bavarian state election.
Meanwhile well over a third of Bavarians told Forsa that the CSU are the single biggest problem in their state, above the number who said refugees are Bavaria's biggest headache.
Meanwhile a powerful alliance of business leaders has closed rank behind the Chancellor.
The country's four most influential industry associations on Friday released a common statement which denounced Seehofer in no uncertain terms.
“What we need now is a stable and resolute government that works together with its European partners constructively and calmly,” the statement read. “The German economy is convinced that acting only out of national interest will do more harm than good.”
So will Seehofer close the border and risk an all out battle for power in Bavaria? Only he knows that - and on Friday he was staying silent. A spokesperson said that he was refusing to comment on the EU migration summit. He would wait instead to speak to Merkel in person."

					09:47 CET+01:00				",AFP,Hussein K. given life sentence for rape and murder of Freiburg student ,"An asylum seeker claiming to be from Afghanistan was sentenced to life in jail on Thursday for the rape and murder of a student that fuelled a backlash against a mass migrant influx.
Hussein Khavari, of uncertain age and origin, was found guilty of the deadly night-time attack on medical student Maria Ladenburger, 19, in October 2016 in the university town of Freiburg.
Khavari pushed her off her bicycle as she was riding home alone from a party, then bit, choked and repeatedly raped her and left her on the bank of a river where she drowned.
Presiding judge Kathrin Schenk condemned the extreme ""lack of empathy"" of Khavari, who was handcuffed and wearing a black hooded jumper, before reading out the verdict and sentence, which were greeted with applause in the courtroom.
She handed down the maximum sentence of life in prison, which under German law means 15 years behind bars, with no chance of parole and the possibility of ""security detention"" afterwards if the convict is still deemed to pose a threat to society.
Schenk said she saw almost no chance of rehabilitation, telling Khavari that ""you would have to become an entirely different human being"".
Khavari had been arrested seven weeks after the murder, following a huge manhunt in the town near the French border.
Police had found a black hair partially dyed blond at the scene, then spotted Khavari by his hairstyle on security camera footage and linked him to the crime using his DNA.
As the crime sparked public anger and revulsion, social media users posted sarcastic ""thank you"" messages to Chancellor Angela Merkel over her liberal policy that brought more than one million refugees and migrants to the country.
During the trial, prosecutor Eckart Berger had reminded the two jurors sitting alongside three judges that ""on trial is a criminal offender and not Germany's refugee policy"".
Jailed in Greece
Khavari arrived in Germany, without identity papers, in November 2015, near the peak of the refugee influx, as an unaccompanied minor claiming to be 16 or 17 years old and hailing from Afghanistan.
A police officer told the court that Khavari's cellphone and social media accounts suggested he had lived in Iran.
Khavari was sent to live with a German host family in the picturesque town on the edge of the Black Forest, went to a local school, learnt German and received state benefits.
It emerged only after his arrest that he had already committed a violent crime in May 2013 in Greece, where he pushed a woman off a cliff on the island of Corfu, leaving her badly injured.
He was sentenced there in February 2014 to 10 years jail for attempted murder but was granted a conditional release from Greece's overcrowded jails in October 2015.
He fled to Germany, where authorities knew nothing of his criminal past because Greece had only issued a nationwide warrant, and because no match was detected in an EU-wide fingerprint database for asylum seekers.
Khavari was initially tried as a juvenile offender, but the court accepted expert opinions, based on X-rays and dental analysis, that he is now aged between 22 and 29.
The defendant had admitted to the crime, but claimed diminished culpability because he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs -- a position which his defence said it would argue again in an appeal.
Khavari had also claimed that his father died long ago in a battle against Afghanistan's Taliban.
Judge Schenk in December dialled a number on Khavari's cellphone and reached his father, who told her through an interpreter that he was living in Iran."

The number of first-time asylum applications in the EU decreased by half year-on-year to 649,855 in 2017, reported the Funke Mediengruppe, citing figures from the EU’s statistics office Eurostat.
In Germany, too, this figure decreased - but the country still registered the highest amount of first-time applications (198,255) in 2017 compared to its European neighbours.
Last year, Italy ranked second with 126,550 applications, followed by France (91,070) and Greece (57,020). Austria ranked in eighth place with 22,160 applications.
1.55 million first-time applications were made in Germany between 2011 and 2016, with over half of those applications coming in 2015 and 2016.

The share of first-time applications from asylum seekers in Germany has also declined. While in 2016, Germany received 60 percent of applications across the EU, last year this had gone down to around 30 percent.
If secondary and follow-up applications were taken into account, according to the report, the total for 2017 would be 704,625 applications across the EU, including 222,560 in Germany.
This declining trend in figures has continued in Deutschland in 2018. 11,000 people in the country were registered as asylum seekers for the first time in February, according to the Federal Interior Ministry. This was about 3,300 fewer than in February 2017, with most of the applicants from Syria, Iraq and Nigeria.
The number of first-time, secondary and follow-up asylum applications submitted to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) last month was 12,490.

""Obviously, the usage of the Transall [military transport aircraft] is not ruled out. But only in the event that all civilian transport capacities are exhausted and if it does not affect the German army's priority missions, then could such troop carriers be [an option],"" she said.
But the plan was swiftly criticized in human rights circles, with Bernd Mesovic from NGO Pro Asyl telling The Local that ""deportations are clearly not in the remit of the army.""
""This suggestion would hardly be constitutional,"" he said. ""The army can be used in cases of natural catastrophes such as flooding. But this isn't a natural catastrophe or an especially serious accident – which according to Article 35 of the constitution would allow for military operations within the country.“
""Expelling asylum seekers using military vehicles would furthermore have a disastrous symbolic effect. It would signal: the German government is acting militarily against refugees,“ Mesovic concluded.
With a record one million asylum seekers expected to arrive in Germany this year, Berlin wants to speed up the process by which unsuccessful applicants are returned quickly to their home countries, in order to free up resources to provide protection to those fleeing war and persecution.
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said that it was ""clear that for repatriation by air, civilian aircraft would be used as a priority"".
""But in the event that civilian capacity is insufficient, then ... we will look at possibly using army aircraft,"" he added.
Besides Transall military aircraft which can transport between 50 and 60 people each, the German army also has two Airbus A310 troop carriers, which are fitted out like civilian planes and each seat 200 people."

					11:31 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Berlin refugee boss resigns in disgrace,"The head of Berlin's main asylum seeker registration centre has been forced to resign over the chaos plaguing the
office, which is struggling to process a record number of newcomers.
Franz Allert's resignation late on Wednesday came shortly after the German capital's mayor Michael Müller made an open call on public broadcaster RBB for ""new leadership for Lageso"".
Known by its acronym Lageso, Berlin's State Health and Social Office is migrants' first port of call in the German capital.
Since June, hundreds of men, women and children have queued and jostled almost daily in its unsheltered dirt courtyard, some of them for weeks, waiting for a number and an initial interview with a frazzled bureaucrat inside.
But activists at Moabit Hilft, one of the groups which has organized grassroots support for the refugees waiting at the Lageso, don't believe the change of leadership will help them.
""Of course we don't expect anything to change. The fish stinks from the head down – the [Berlin] Senate is responsible for the situation,"" Moabit Hilft spokeswoman Diana Henniges told The Local.
She argued that the city needed to send more experts to organize humanitarian and medical aid – and call in outside help to restructure the inefficient bureaucracy at the Lageso.
As the weather gets chillier, she said, the situation will inevitably get worse.
""People are out on the street in the cold, and they are hungry because they don't have any money. It's down to two degrees and it might snow next week,"" Henniges said.
The poor conditions outside the Lageso have meant that security guards, backed by police, have sometimes had to contain the crowds as scuffles have broken out.
Neighbourhood volunteers like those organized by Moabit Hilft have so far averted disaster by handing out clothes, warm drinks and food as the weather turned colder.
Henniges invited any Berliners looking to help to register as a volunteer with Moabit Hilft and check the list of items they can donate.
Lageso was also where a four-year-old Bosnian refugee was kidnapped and later raped and killed by a paedophile who apparently took advantage of the chaos at the site.
Germany is expecting to record one million in asylum seeker arrivals this year, and Berlin has registered 70,000 newcomers since January.
'Shocking' situation
Despite volunteers' best efforts, the situation is ""shocking and unworthy of a democratic society,"" charged the Green Party's parliamentary vice president Claudia Roth.
In an open letter to Berlin mayor Martin Mueller, she said she saw people ""endure the queues, sometimes in the mud, rain and storm, often tightly packed into closed-off ares, tents or buildings, with no guarantee that their suffering will be worth it"".
Many of the refugees, Roth wrote, ""feel powerless, helpless and as if trapped in a nightmare"".
'Inhumane conditions'
Roth said that in her southern German home state of Bavaria - where conservative politicians have railed the loudest against the influx – the on-the-ground aid efforts had nonetheless been far more professional.
This was despite the fact Bavaria is taking in 15 percent of refugees coming to Germany, against five percent for Berlin.
Highlighting the chaos has been the tragic case of four-year-old Bosnian boy who was kidnapped from the crowd and killed by a serial offender.
Mueller defended his city's efforts, pointing to the ""special situation"" and ongoing efforts to expand staffing and services, adding that ""the topic of housing refugees should not be used for political games"".
Meanwhile, over 40 lawyers have filed a criminal complaint against the city's health senator Mario Czaja, alleging the institutional neglect was ""causing bodily harm"".
""In no other state are politicians and administrators failing as systematically as here,"" charged lawyer Christina Clemm, claiming the result was injuries, illnesses, hunger and homelessness.
Tensions in refugee camps
Another Berlin flashpoint has been a vast refuge shelter set up, months after the idea was first floated, in the massive Nazi-era Tempelhof airport, which during the Cold War served as a crucial western military air hub.
The mood inside has been described as tense, in part because 2,200 inhabitants in bunk beds have to use outside portable toilets and a bus shuttle service to take showers in nearby public swimming pools.
""These are inhumane housing conditions,"" a volunteer told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""There are children who have scabies but receive no medical treatment and continue to play with others.""
In late November, tensions escalated at Tempelhof and groups attacked each other, some armed with metal rods and knives.
Berlin, faced with a chronic housing shortage, plans to expand the Tempelhof site and accommodate up to 8,000 people in tents inside its hangars.
The Berliner Zeitung daily said the challenge was to build a functioning refugee facility ""akin to a small town"".
""The experiment at the airport, which once stood for the defence of freedom, must succeed,"" it said.
""Otherwise there is a danger that Tempelhof will be mentioned in the same breath as the infamous Lageso. It would be proof yet again of the government's failure,"" added the daily, referring to the registration centre.

Günter Krings, deputy leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union's parliamentary group, told the daily Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the plan from Brussels, which would make it easier for asylum-seekers to arrive and stay in Europe, would be resisted by Germany.
“If the EU plans were implemented, a situation could arise like in the 1990s with up to 400,000 asylum seekers in a year,” Krings said.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, wants to change the so-called “airport proceedings” to make it more legally complicated to turn asylum-seekers away after they arrive by plane. It also wants to provide social support payments to asylum-seekers based on the same rates as support for legal residents and allow them to enter the job market more quickly.
But the proposed changes went too far, Krings said. He said the planned European asylum system would “tear up important cornerstones of the asylum compromises of 1993 painstaking achieved in Germany.”
Airport proceedings needed to be maintained, as did the principle that the EU state in which an asylum-seeker first arrived was responsible for dealing with them.

Last month there were 7,541 asylum applications filed, fueled by 2,055 applications from Russian citizens. The office said they are experiencing a strong increase in Russian asylum seekers, who first apply for asylum in Poland but eventually end up in Germany.
All totaled there were 26,792 asylum applications in the first four months of this year – a 73 percent increase over the 11,310 seen in the January to April period of 2012.
Russian asylum seekers prefer Germany to Poland because of the higher level of social services and support than get in Germany.
The more then two thousand asylum seekers from Russia pales in comparison to the 691 from Syria, the number two country, followed by 536 from Afghanistan and 502 from Iran.
Serbian asylum seekers with 482 rose once more. People coming from Serbia can enter Germany as tourists, following a relaxation of immigration rules, and can then declare themselves as asylum seekers.
To counter this Germany introduced a fast track approval for asylum seekers from Serbia and other countries, such as Macedonia and Kosovo. The applications are processed in a few days and the applicants face costs that are higher than what they would receive in German social benefits for their stays.
This has so far resulted in a drop in asylum seekers from Macedonia and Kosovo but not yet from Serbia.

Saide Abibulaeva feared that her life was in danger last year.
The 62-year-old Ukrainian woman was living in Crimea with diabetes, but could not get access to medical care with pro-Russian troops occupying the area.
""She was very stressed and her blood sugar went high, which is very dangerous,"" her daughter, Sevil Agcadag, told The Local from her home Stuttgart.
""Our people are in a horrible situation.""
Abibulaeva decided to flee the country for Germany, joining her daughter and grandchild, and apply for asylum, but she is expected to wait about 16 months for a decision, her daughter said.
She is just one of thousands of Ukrainians who applied for asylum last year in Germany. The country received the highest number of Ukrainian asylum requests in the European U at 2,705, Eurostat reported - 18 times greater than 2013's 150 applicants.
Of the Ukrainians who applied, Germany accepted 20 in the first instance, but rejected another 45.
Overall, the number of Ukrainian asylum seekers in the 28 EU member states ballooned to 14,040 people in 2014 - more than 13 times higher than the number in 2013 at 1,060 applicants.
That number is even greater when compared to 2008, the beginning of the global economic crisis, when 925 Ukrainians applied for asylum.
“What we have seen from our members working with asylum seekers are those who are fleeing the conflict in the east of Ukraine,” Julia Zelvenska, a senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, told The Local. “In the past, it has been for political persecution, like in 2013, or for sexual orientation.”
The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last month that an estimated one million Ukrainians were displaced internally, with many people moving west. Some 600,000 people had sought asylum, many of them in non-EU countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova.
But many Ukrainians also applied for asylum in the European Union in 2014, a year that started with a revolution in Kiev and the ousting of the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Russia then annexed Crimea in March, in a move widely condemned around the world, before propping up separatists fighting bloody battles with Ukrainian forces in the east of the country.
""My mother gets bad news from Ukraine every day. Many people are in jail, she left her husband and her son. She is scared for her family,"" Agcadag told The Local, tearfully. ""But I understand her very well. She cries almost every day.""
Of those who applied for asylum in 2014, 650 Ukrainians received positive outcomes on their first application decision in the EU. Eurostat defines positive outcomes as grants of refugee or subsidiary protection status, or an authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons.
Still, those who received good news were greatly outnumbered by those who were rejected in their first try - 2,335.
Zelvenska explained to The Local that it is generally very hard for Ukrainians to gain asylum in EU member states, or to even reach those countries in the first place.
“One of the main reasons people get rejected may be that many countries are not clear on how the situation developed and won't issue decisions until it is clear how the Ukrainian situation is going to develop,” she said.
“European countries are also being very formalistic in the criteria for asylum,” Zelvenska added. “For example, they may say that there are options for alternative protection already within Ukraine. For people in the east, they may say that they could relocate to the west.”
Zelvenska noted though that reasons for rejection are not made public so it is difficult to know for certain.
“We think it's not necessary to apply all the criteria in a strict manner,” she said. “They must consider each case, country and the circumstances.”
The number of Ukrainian asylum seekers through the first two months of 2015 has dropped significantly across the EU and applicants to Poland are likely to surpass those to Germany, Zelvenska said.
Only 125 Ukrainians applied for asylum across Europe in February, according to Zelvenska. Last year, EU countries received the highest number of asylum seekers since 1992 with a total of 626,000 applicants. More than 400,000 people applied in 2013."
