					18:05 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,When should the media report on murders by refugees?,"Responsibly reporting on violent crime committed by refugees is one of the hardest things for a news organization to get right. A national broadcaster’s decision not to cover one such murder caused Jörg Luyken to take a closer look.
Do newspapers focus too much on crimes committed by refugees, thus creating an exaggerated public fear of the danger they pose? Or do they too often ignore them out of a misplaced concern that they would be fuelling racism?
Depending on who you talk to in Germany, you will get very different opinions. Left-wingers believe the press over-report, cynically exploiting the fact that refugee crime sells newspapers. The right meanwhile harangue the “politically correct” media for failing to inform the public of a growing crime wave.
As an editor who has to make calls on what does and doesn’t appear on our website, I can say it is a mighty hard call.
I am well aware of the fact that a horrific crime with an asylum seeker as the suspect - such as the rape-murder of a teenage girl in Wiesbaden in June - will bring readers to our website. In a time of declining advertising revenues, news organizations face pressure to maximize their readership.
So are we journalists pushing refugees under the bus to save our own skin? Have we awoken a latent xenophobia in the general public that helps us sell newspapers every time an asylum seeker commits a crime?
That is certainly the conclusion to draw from a statement made by German public broadcaster ARD earlier this month. ARD is publicly financed and therefore free to cover the news without fear that low ratings will drive it into bankruptcy.
On August 16th, its Tagesschau evening news bulletin chose not to mention a grim murder in the central German town of Offenbach. A doctor had been stabbed to death in his practise that morning with no obvious explanation for why. Hours later police arrested his suspected murderer - an asylum seeker from Somalia who arrived in the country in late 2015.
After receiving complaints from the public for its decision not to cover the crime, Tagesschau’s editor-in-chief Kai Gniffke publicly justified the decision.
He explained that Tagesschau only reports on news that has “a societal, national or international relevance - things that are meaningful to the majority of the 83 million Germans.”
Murders committed by refugees would only be relevant to the whole country “if refugees are over-proportionally likely to be involved in committing homicide,” he argued. “As far as we can tell from our research, this isn’t the case - therefore we decided not to report on the crime.”
There is a clear logic here: refugees are no more likely to murder than other members of society, therefore any national media outlet that reports on murders by refugees while ignoring other murders is giving the false impression that refugees are more dangerous than Germans.
Looking at crime figures
So is that it settled? Well, no. A closer look at the national crime statistics shows that Mr. Gniffke's conclusion is fairly wide of the mark.
Crime figures collected by the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) show that of a total of 785 murder cases nationwide last year, police identified a refugee or asylum seeker as a culprit in 82 of the cases.
In other words, refugees and asylum seekers were believed to be responsible for 10.4 percent of all murders in 2017, meaning they would need to constitute over 8 million of Germany’s 83 million population to have been averagely likely to be investigated for murder. Official figures state that Germany’s refugee population was around 1.6 million at the end of 2016 and stayed more or less stable in 2017.
So I asked Tagesschau what figures they based their research on.
A spokesperson said that a fiery debate in the editorial room had centred on the national crime statistics. Refugees were involved (either as perpetrator or victim) in 487 of 3,765 murder and manslaughter cases (12.9 percent) last year, he said, leading the editorial team to conclude that “refugees are more often involved in homicide than German citizens.”
Wait a minute. Doesn't this contradict Gniffke's official statement?
The spokesperson explained that the fact that refugees are more often involved in homicide “is from the point of view of criminologists unsurprising due to the fact that we are talking about young men who live in precarious circumstances.”
So it seems that Gniffke’s statement was actually worded rather inaccurately. What he meant to say was not that refugees are just as likely to commit crimes as Germans, but that they are just as likely to commit crimes as similar Germans.
The ARD spokesperson referred me to the work of Dr. Christian Pfeiffer, one Germany’s leading criminologists to learn more.
“At a first glance refugees are clearly over-represented in homicide cases”, Pfeiffer told me, but comparing refugees to the rest of the population “is like comparing apples and oranges.”
“Young men are the most dangerous people in every country in the world. In 2014 men between the ages of 14 and 30 made up nine percent of the German population and were responsible for half of all violent crime,” he explained. “Men in this age category made up 27 percent of the refugees who arrived in 2015, this alone shows that they pose a higher risk of committing homicide than the native population.”
What makes a murder ‘nationally relevant'?
But ARD's point of view still seems problematic, firstly because it brushes aside possible cultural factors behind crime and secondly because it ignores the relevance of the fact that 27 percent of asylum seekers in Germany are young men.
The orthodox position of criminologists is to explain all differences in the crime statistics via either the sex, age or societal position in Germany. Academics will refer you to these factors and become quite touchy when you start to ask them about culture (as one bold red email from an academic at the Ruhr University proved to me.)
Pfeiffer, though, said that there are certain violent crimes taking place in Germany today in which cultural background is important. He stressed that culture is not always relevant, but some murders “can only be explained through the [perpetrator's] background in a country of male dominance and honour culture.”
In the past year, three young Afghan asylum seekers have been accused of killing their girlfriends after they broke up with them. These incidents, which took place in different parts of the country appear to be of national relevance due to the fact that they suggest a wider social phenomenon.
The second reason that the ARD justification is problematic is that it doesn't ask why 27 percent of all refugees in Germany are young men. When Germany took in over a million refugees in 2015 and 2016, it didn't take people directly from the Middle East (like Canada did). Instead it opened its land border, meaning young men were much more likely to arrive in the country.
Arguably, this was an irresponsible policy which the government should have known would lead to a higher murder rate. Every single murder with a suspect who arrived as a refugee in 2015 thus becomes something of political relevance.
Criminologist Pfeiffer disputes this line of argument.
“The Chancellor needed to make an emergency decision [in 2015], it was in some sense like putting out a fire,” he says. “Canada, which took in 60,000 refugees at the time was faced with a completely different situation. They chose families to take by plane for Jordan thus avoiding the large proportion of young men that necessarily turn up when one lets refugees flow over the border after they have come across the Mediterranean.”
“Canadian politicians could come up with their policy in complete peace at their desks. Germany needed to act immediately, that is the crucial difference,” he concluded.
Not everyone sees things this way, though. Robin Alexander, political correspondent for Die Welt, has documented how Merkel was so disinterested in the refugee crisis until late 2015 that she never visited a single refugee centre during her previous decade in power. Merkel herself gave a mea culpa in parliament earlier this year, saying that she and other European leaders ignored the refugee problem until it was too late - meaning they left themselves with no choice but to open the border.
In summary: refugees are more likely to be suspected of murder. The most significant reason for this is because they are young and male. Choosing not to cover these murders means one accepts the argument that the government could not have done things differently in 2015; choosing to cover them is to give a nod to the argument that they had different policy options.
That is not an easy call to make."

					13:03 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Cash for refugee status: the scandal rocking the German asylum system,"Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has said that he won’t spare reputations in his efforts to get to the bottom of a scandal that has hit public trust in the asylum process. What is the so-called 'Bamf affair'?
What is the BAMF affair?
The scandal centres around the Federal Office for Immigration and Refugees, which goes by the acronym BAMF.
The BAMF office in Bremen is accused of wrongfully granting asylum to over a thousand refugees between 2013 and 2016 who had their applications dismissed in other federal states.
Prosecutors in Bremen are currently investigating the former head of the Bremen office, Ulrike B., and various employees on suspicion that they took bribes in exchange for granting favourable decisions.
In April, prosecutors searched six private properties and the offices of two law firms as part of their investigation. While it is not yet certain whether BAMF employees in Bremen received money in return for granting asylum, a lawyer's office in Hildesheim is said to have charged €1,000 to ensure that the Bremen office handed down a positive decision.
Are there wider implications?
The scandal has spotlighted a strange anomaly in Germany: whether you get asylum depends heavily on where you apply.
Figures published in October last year showed that Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers were far more likely to receive asylum in Bremen than in states like Brandenburg and Bavaria.
In Bremen, the success rate for asylum seekers from Iraq was 96.4 percent in the first six months of 2017 - almost twice as high as in Berlin, where the rate was 50.3 percent. Moreover, 65 percent of asylum applications from Afghans were successful in Bremen, whereas 30.9 percent of Afghan asylum seekers were successful in Brandenburg.
The Interior Ministry has now decided to look more closely at this anomaly and is reviewing the asylum process in ten states where applications have been granted at rates that are either unusually high or unusually low. As part of the investigation some 8,500 randomly chosen cases will be examined for irregularities.
Seehofer has said that sloppiness or overwork “seem to"" explaine the wide difference in approval rates. “But I always say that it 'seems to be' the case. We are working it all out to make sure that everything is cleared up,” he said on Tuesday.

How badly does this damage BAMF?
As if the scandal in Bremen wasn’t bad enough for the credibility of Germany’s refugee authority, Spiegel on Tuesday reported that BAMF headquarters likely knew about the illegal practices a year ago and tried to cover them up.
The investigative magazine has seen emails which suggest that BAMF boss Jutta Cordt was warned in February 2017 that malpractice was taking place in the city state.
In the emails, senior BAMF figures deliberate how to investigate the suspicion of malpractice. The officials worry that reviewing too many cases would cause a public scandal and harm the BAMF's reputation.
A senior figure at the authority wrote in one email “please take action in a ‘silent’ way. I don’t want all of the details to be checked.”
BAMF eventually investigated Bremen boss Ulrike B. in March last year, but after imposing a pay penalty on her, they let her stay in her job. Only when prosecutors announced their investigation last month, did Ulrike B. lose her job.

A survey published by Die Welt on Monday suggests that the scandal has massively affected public trust in the authority. Some 80 percent of respondents said that their faith in BAMF was either “limited” or “very limited.”
What will change now?
The scandal could barely have come at a worse time for the German authorities. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) cruised into the Bundestag in last year’s national elections by stoking popular fears that Germany’s asylum system is widely abused.
The AfD, along with the pro-business Free Democrats have now called for a parliamentary enquiry into the case.
But for an enquiry to be set up, a quarter of MPs need to vote for it. That leaves the AfD and FDP needing to convince one of the other factions in the Bundestag to vote with them.
So far though, no other party has said that it is keen on the idea of a parliamentary enquiry. The Green party have instead called for BAMF boss Cordt to lose her job.
“If the suspicion hardens that the head of BAMF ignored indications of wrongdoing or didn’t look into these properly, she can’t stay in her job,” refugee spokeswoman for the Greens, Luise Amtsberg, said.
The coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Union have so far resisted the call for an enquiry, preferring to handle the scandal ‘in house.’
Seehofer said on Monday that he would investigate the case “without regard for people or institutions.”
“I will make decisions in the coming weeks that will have consequences for the BAMF as well as people in it,” he said. He added that “a lot needs to be done, not only in Bremen.”
The SPD also called for Seehofer to take decisive action.
“We need a refugee authority that functions and works in the best possible way,” said Burkhard Lischka, domestic affairs spokesperson for the party.
TAZ, a newspaper known for its pro-refugee sympathies, has called for a public enquiry.
“The BAMF is the German authority which is most dangerous for societal peace if it messes up,” the newspaper wrote on Monday.
“This isn’t just about terrorists or criminals who could have used the authorities in Bremen to waltz into the country… in every village pub there will now be people saying ‘I told you so’ and others who no longer greet their Syrian neighbours.”

				11 May 2018
				15:57 CEST+02:00			 
					15:57 CEST+02:00				", The Local,The ‘asylum industry’ debate: who is profiting from the refugee crisis?,"A senior member of Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU) sparked a heated discussion this week when he claimed that Germany has an “anti-deportation industry.” Did he have a point?
What is the debate all about?
At the start of the month, police officers in Baden-Württemberg went to an asylum centre to try and detain a young man from Togo whose application for asylum had been rejected.
But the operation ended in surprising failure when migrants at the centre surrounded the police and forced them to leave - without the Togolese man.
A couple of days later the police raided the camp in much larger numbers and arrested the man. But the incident shone a spotlight on the thorny issue of deportations of failed asylum seekers and whether German authorities are effective in their work.
The far-right Alternative for Germany, the loudest critics of the government’s refugee policies, claimed that the rule of law was crumbling as migrants were ever more willing to team up to violently prevent deportations.
On the other side of the debate, Die Linke (the Left Party) said that the case was an isolated incident that did not say anything about the general attitude of migrants to respect for the law.
“People are being criminalized here who above all were acting out of solidarity,” said Gökay Akbulut, Die Linke's spokesman on migration.
What has this got to do with lawyers?
While the case at hand had nothing to do with NGOs, conservative politicians took the opportunity to air general grievances they had about deportations (or the lack thereof).
In an interview with Bild, Alexander Dobrindt, the vocal head of the CSU in the Bundestag, decided to aim his fire at NGOs and lawyers, who he accused of holding up deportations by dragging appeals through the courts for their own profit.
Germany has an “aggressive anti-deportation industry,” the goal of which is “to intentionally sabotage the rule of law,” Dobrindt said.
He also accused pro-refugee NGOs of supporting appeals by migrants with criminal records and thus “not working for the right to asylum, but rather against societal stability.”

Does Dobrindt have a point?

It is indisputable that having one's asylum request turned down in Germany in no way means that one has to leave the country. At the end of 2016 over half a million people were living in the Bundesrepublik who had been turned down for asylum.
Compared to that number, the deportation figures are tiny. In 2017, some 24,000 migrants were deported, a slight drop on the number for 2016.
There are many reasons for why people are not deported. Illnesses that can't be adequately treated at home, or the home country failing to provide identity papers are just two common reasons why a deportation cannot be carried out.
On occasion the failure to deport someone who had failed to gain asylum has been a source of major controversy. This was most notoriously the case for Anis Amri, the Tunisian terrorist who drove a truck into a Berlin Christmas market in 2016. Amri, who killed 12 people in the attack, was supposed to be deported, but Tunisia had failed to provide the necessary identity papers.
Another reason that people stay after their case has been rejected by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) is that they appeal the decision in court. The courts have been overloaded with cases in recent years. By September last year there was a backlog of 283,000 cases.
At the same time, targeting the lawyers and NGOs that help migrants appeal the BAMF decision seems to be rather bizarre. One newspaper compared it to blaming divorce lawyers for the high number of marriage breakdowns.
What has the reaction been like?
Pro-Asyl, one of the largest pro-refugee NGOs, responded by saying it is “fundamental to the rule of law that decisions taken by state authorities can be evaluated by an independent court.”
In the political mainstream, the reaction to Dobrindt’s comment has been everything from outraged to critical. The Social Democrats (SPD), partners in the German government with the CSU, were particularly vocal.
“Talking about an anti-deportation industry is nonsense, because people who are opposed to deportations have no financial incentive,” said SPD MP Johannes Kahrs.
Kahrs accused Dobrindt of not really believing his own words, but rather engaging in a cynical ploy to win voters back from the AfD.

Katrin Göring-Eckardt, the head of the Green party in the Bundestag, said that “citizens’ organizations and lawyers who check that asylum procedures have been properly implemented are the ones who are upholding the rule of law.” It was ""unspeakable"" of Dobrindt to ""slander the work of these groups.""
Legal experts were just as quick to dismiss Dobrindt’s accusation.
“Everyone has the right to appeal a decision in our legal system,” head of the Federal Lawyers’ Association, Ulrich Schellenberg, said. “Mr Dobrindt has weakened the rule of law with his statement.”

Has anyone stood up for Dobrindt?
While the overwhelming response to Dobrindt’s comments has been negative, a few people have taken his side.
His party leader, Horst Seehofer, said that “almost every second asylum decision ends up in front of the courts - that costs time, and ties up resources.” Seehofer argued that Dobrindt was “drawing attention to the fact that asylum decision are appealed in unusually large numbers.""
For those on the left of the political debate, the reason why so many asylum decision are appealed is clear: the chances of success are relatively good. Syrians, for instance, often appeal BAMF’s decision to offer them “subsidiary protection” rather than full refugee status. Last year, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that four out of five court appeals by Syrians ended in their favour.
But Jan Fleischhauer, a conservative commentator at Spiegel, disputes that assumption that all migrants have a realistic chance of overturning the BAMF’s decision.
“Those who arrive from Pakistan or Nigeria have as good as no chance of winning in court, but that doesn’t stop their lawyers from trying,” he wrote on Friday.
Fleischhauer points out that asylum appeals are different from other types of court cases: even if BAMF wins the case, it still has to cover its own legal costs.
This incentivizes lawyers to test the BAMF’s decisions even in relatively hopeless cases, Fleischauer argues.
Meanwhile “the public are supplying the financial incentive. Organizations like Caritas and ProAysl have set up big donation pots which the lawyers are paid from.”"

					11:59 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Refugees still welcome? How one girl's murder is dividing Germany,"The murder of a girl in Wiesbaden is polarizing the debate about refugees and criminality. The brutal crime is just the latest in which an asylum seeker is the chief suspect.
Germany, June 2018. If you want to measure the political mood in the country, look at the streets of Mainz this weekend.
More than half a dozen demonstrations and ceremonies took place in response to the murder and suspected rape of 14-year-old Susanna by a young Iraqi man. Some marched to protest against criminal refugees and illegal immigration. Others marched against prejudice and racism.
The Alternative for Germany (AfD) called for a protest vigil under the motto ""that's enough!"" Three years after the refugee crisis, a deep rupture divides Germany.
The Wilkommenskultur has become a culture of rage. ""Wir schaffen das"" - Merkel's famous refrain when refugees arrived in 2015 - has become ""us against them"".
The Susanna case has reminded people of the tragedy in Freiburg, a picturesque town in southern Germany where a refugee raped a young woman and left her to drown. It is also reminiscent of a murder in Kandel, where prosecutors say that an Afghani asylum-seeker stabbed a 15-year-old girl to death. In all three cases, the pattern appears the same: a brutal crime, a dead girl, an accused refugee.
Every case has stirred up more indignation and rage - and with each crime the suspicion that we are talking about more than just individual cases grows.
""These are no longer isolated incidents"", warns Susanne Schröter, an ethnologist and head of the Research Centre of Global Islam at the Goethe University in Frankfurt. She speaks of a culture clash and says that Germany needs to develop a new approach for dealing with aggressive men shaped by patriarchal cultures.
The key facts of the Susanna F. case apparently confirm the view points of the harshest critics of Germany's refugee policies.
The killer was an Iraqi man, who applied for asylum in Germany in vain and who then used legal methods to prevent his deportation. He had multiple run-ins with the police due to violent behaviour and had even been linked to the rape of an eleven-year old girl. Nonetheless, after the murder, he was able to escape to his homeland with his whole family - despite the fact that he was a suspect.
Bild tabloid, which was one of the most vocal supporters of Angela Merkel's refugee policy in 2015, demanded in an editorial that the federal government ask Susanna's family for forgiveness.
On Sunday, Merkel called the crime and ""abominable murder"" that must be decisively prosecuted. AfD parliamentary chairperson Alice Weidel responded by accusing the Chancellor of cynicism. She said that the government needs to ""immediately and without exception get all criminal migrants, and all of those without the right to stay, out of the country.""
But the exact circumstances of the murder of Susanna F. still remain unexplained. And even before she has been buried, she is being used by far-right politicians as a symbol to attack Merkel's refugee policies.
The AfD orchestrated a minute of silence in the Bundestag last week and demanded that the Chancellor resign. Under the hashtag #Susanna, Twitter users are unleashing venom against refugees.
The emotional reactions to the case illustrate how Germany has changed. Back in the autumn of 2015 there were warnings that the mood in the population could change fast. It did in fact change on New Year's Eve 2015, when over one thousand women reported being sexually assaulted in a crowd at Cologne cathedral.
The Susanna F. case evokes the spectre of a loss of control, an overwhelmed state that no longer has a handle on asylum policy - this is all happening in a society that sets a high value on law and order.
Compounding the sense of a failing asylum policy is an ongoing scandal over abuses in the federal migration office - the Bremen branch is suspected of wrongly approving over a thousand asylum applications in return for bribes. Meanwhile the approval process for asylum requests is being re-evaluated in several other state migration offices.
Susanna F.'s mother, meanwhile, has accused police investigators of grave failures. She reported her daughter as missing one day after her disappearance. A week later, she got a message from a female acquaintance, reporting that the girl's corpse was lying on a train track. Only then did the authorities begin their manhunt. But at first they didn't question the acquaintance who gave the tip, because she was on a short vacation with her mother.
It was in fact a 13-year-old boy who gave the decisive information. He told investigators about the possible scene of the crime - and named Ali B. as the potential murderer. The boy is also an asylum seeker, and lived at the same camp as Ali B."

					10:00 CEST+02:00				", The Local,The Germans offering their homes to refugees,"As Europe works to tackle a growing refugee crisis, The Local hears from one project helping ordinary Germans make a difference. Refugees Welcome matches refugees with spare rooms across Germany and Austria - and the scheme is set to grow even larger in the coming months.
When Mareike Geiling left Berlin last November to work in Cairo for six months, she and her flatmate Jonas Kakoschke had already found someone to rent her room during the trip.
However, unusually for Berlin, Jonas' new flatmate Bakary Conan wasn't a relative, friend or someone they'd met on a flatshare website - he was a refugee from war-torn Mali.
After deciding to host a refugee in their home, the pair reached out to family and friends, raising funds to cover Conan's rent. Within two weeks, they'd met their target – and the experience prompted them to encourage others to do the same.
Ten months later, Kakoschke and Geiling were fielding questions from a pack of international reporters about their project as Germany faced unprecedented numbers of refugee arrivals.
A flat-share website for refugees
Explaining that they had recently been ""overwhelmed"" by support, Kakoschke and Geiling held the event on September 8th because it was simply ""beyond their capacity"" to arrange interviews with every publication interested in their work.
From one room for Conan, the project has grown into Refugees Welcome, a site matching refugees with spare rooms across Germany and Austria. So far, the scheme has matched 138 refugees with rooms across the two countries.
""Because it was so easy, we asked ourselves: why are we the only ones doing this?"" Kakoschke explained.
Along with fellow Berliner Golde Ebding, he and Geiling set up the website to match refugees with spare rooms.
The idea might appeal to students in flatshares , they thought – but the group were amazed by the range of people who showed interest.
""It's been families, couples, people living alone, and they're from all over Germany,"" Geiling said.
Hosts never have to cover the rent
The scheme is relatively simple: refugees wanting to find a room outside of mass accommodation can register on the project's website. Those wanting to offer a room also register, and both sides give some basic data, including age, profession and background.
Using that information, the team then gets to work matching refugees with homes in their state.
If a match is found, Refugees Welcome organises a meeting with both parties. And if both sides are happy, the hosts could be welcoming in their new flatmate within a couple of weeks.
Nobody who hosts a refugee has to pay their rent, the team stress.
If the refugee is unable to support themselves financially, money is often provided by the unemployment office.
Where money isn't provided, hosts are encouraged to collect micro-donations from friends and relatives, as Geiling and Kakoschke themselves did.
And if this isn't possible, Refugees Welcome has a pot of donated money which they can use to contribute to rent.
""It's never a problem. We always provide a solution,"" Geiling explained.

An 'explosion' of interest
With 86 matches made across Germany, Refugees Welcome has grown considerably since its launch last November - and began a sister programme in Austria in January.
As the only full-time team members, Geiling and Kakoschke work well over 40 hours a week to keep the project afloat.
But last week, after news of their work appeared in British press, the pair experienced a new ""explosion"" of interest.
""Since last week we've had over 100 emails from people who want to set up the initiative in their country,"" they said.
It was never the plan to expand Refugees Welcome into other countries, they explain – but now the interest has spread, they are keen to help others take it further.
Not all offers are suitable
The Local asked the team whether they'd had to turn down any offers of rooms for refugees.
Sadly, yes, they explained.
Landlords often want to let out empty flats to whole families – but this is something Refugees Welcome doesn't offer. ""For us, the key is the living together, and this isn't possible if you provide an empty flat,"" they explained.
However, the team are also forced to turn down offers on other grounds.
They receive many requests from people who only want to host for three months, and have very specific requirements, Geiling said.
She explained: ""we get a lot from people who say things like: 'I would like to host someone who's a vegetarian, woman, Christian,from Syria, 25 years old..'""
""It seems like some people just want to have the experience of hosting a refugee.""
In a city recently named vegetarian capital of the world, it may come as no surprise that many people in Berlin are keen to host vegetarians or vegans.
""We always say this: to decide what you eat – and to decide not to eat meat - comes from a situation of having everything,"" Geiling said. ""People in certain areas don't even know the concept of living vegan.""
Perhaps slightly more sinister are the requests from older men, who tell the team they would like to host a young woman.
""My parents came up with a nice idea that a woman could live with me because I'm not married,"" read one message the project recently received.
It's a matter of intuition weeding out these cases, new team member Sophie explained.
Left-right: founder Jonas, refugee Saidou, team member Sophie, founder Mareike, host Till, refugee Bakary Conan and host Sara
'We need more money'
The team are under no illusions that the site can cater for all of Germany's refugees.
""Of course we don't think we can manage 50,000 refugees,"" they said.
""We're a very small organisation. We're not official: we're filling a niche of what the state and government should do, but don't do.""
They see themselves as a political statement on one hand, and a pilot project on the other, Kakoschke said – not only showing the government that ordinary people want to help refugees, but also proving that it's possible.
The project doesn't receive any government funding, relying on donations and grants from the Mercator Foundation. However, these grants only cover around a quarter of the scheme's annual costs.
""We do this because we would like to change something, and help people,"" they said.
""But if our task is to match a lot of people, we need more money, and help from the government.""
The only way to welcome refugees
It's essential for refugees to move out of mass accommodation as soon as possible, Geiling and Kakoschke believe.
""Decentralised accommodation is the key to welcoming refugees,"" they said. ""It's the only way to welcome them!""
For Conan, living with the pair until June was definitely the right move. ""Many people would like to have the same chance I have had,"" he explained.
Speakers at the press conference also included Berliners Till and Sara, and their flatmate Saidou.
Saidou, a refugee from Niger, spent 18 months living in mass accommodation before moving in with the pair.
""They treat me like a German, like a friend of theirs,"" he said – explaining that during his stay, Till and Sara have helped him improve his German
""We're living together like a normal shared flat. Everyone pays rent,"" Till said.
Saidou contributes to the flat's rent using money he receives from the government. The rest was made up through micro-donations, the pair explain.
""I think [the scheme] will help many refugees,"" Saidou said.
""Berlin is our city. We don't have a real place to live, but we are from Berlin.""

Around 12,000 people attended a rally in Berlin, local radio reported, while Munich and Leipzig also saw protests called for by charity organisations including German-based Lifeline, whose rescue boats were recently prevented from entering Italian waters.
The Lifeline vessel, with more than 230 migrants aboard, was ultimately forced to dock in Malta where it was impounded last month.
Some demonstrators on Saturday donned rescue vests and held up slogans including “humanity is not a political opinion” and “human rights don’t stop at the Mediterranean”.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who backs a hard line on reining in migration, was accused of “exploiting the distress of those at sea” for political reasons, while protesters also vented their ire at Austrian leader Sebastian Kurz and Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini.
“They are flouting human rights, it is not acceptable and is repugnant,” rally organisers said beforehand.
More than 1,400 people have drowned attempting to cross the Mediterranean so far this year according to the International Organization for Migration, the UN’s migration agency.
EU member states last week reached a controversial plan to deal with migrant and refugees arrivals from Africa and the Middle East.
The deal includes the creation of secure centres for migrants in the bloc, “disembarkation platforms” outside the bloc and sharing out refugees among member states.
The accord came after Italy’s new populist government pushed the issue to the forefront of the EU agenda by refusing to open the country’s ports to migrant rescue ships operating in the Mediterranean."

					16:25 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,The refugee debate: just how ‘open’ are Germany’s borders?,"In the current government crisis over migration policy the term “open borders” is thrown about all the time. Anyone who drives to Austria though, knows that there is no physical border there - so what is the debate really about?
Should Germany have open borders or not? Should Merkel have opened Germany’s borders to refugees in 2015? These are questions which have often been asked over the past three years due to the large numbers of migrants who have arrived unhindered in the country.
But these questions can be somewhat confusing given the fact that there have not been controls at Germany’s land borders since 1995 when the Schengen agreement came into force.
The Schengen deal, which now includes 26 European countries, did away with permanent border posts. If you drive from Spain to Poland, for example, you will cross several borders but never actually have to stop and show your passport.
How could Merkel open a border that only exists in name?
The fact that Schengen borders only exist on paper leads to a sense of dissonance when one reads the oft repeated claim that Merkel ""opened"" Germany's borders to refugees in 2015. How could she have opened the borders for people if no hard border actually exists?
ARD journalist Kolja Schwartz writes that the formulation that Merkel opened the borders is “fundamentally wrong since there hadn’t been closed borders in the Schengen area for years. Therefore no border could be opened in 2015.”
Konstantin von Notz, deputy leader of the Green party in the Bundestag (German parliament), has called it “the most pervasive myth of our times.”
Some in Germany argue that the phrase has been deliberately promoted by the far-right to exaggerate Merkel's ""culpability"" for the refugee arrivals.

But this is to ignore a crucial change in policy which was initiated in the summer of 2015.
In August of that year the Chancellor decided to stop applying the EU’s so-called Dublin rules for newly arrived refugees.
The rules stipulate that an asylum seeker has to apply for protection in the EU country in which they first arrive. If they arrive in another EU state, that state can send them back to the country they first arrived in.
But, as Greece buckled under the pressure of hundreds of thousands of arrivals over the sea border to Turkey, Merkel temporarily lifted this legal barrier to freedom of movement within the EU.
For this reason, experts such as Die Welt journalist Robin Alexander, who wrote a best-selling book on the refugee crisis, argue that Merkel did indeed open the borders, even if these were never physically closed.

Are Germany’s borders now closed?
Germany decided to start re-applying the Dublin rules for refugees who arrived from Greece in March 2016, effectively meaning that its application of EU law returned to normal.
That did not mean though that from that point onward all asylum seekers registered in other EU countries could be turned back at the border.
In fact this is what the current conflict inside the German government is all about. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer wants to give border police the power to turn back asylum seekers before they enter the country. Merkel says they should be let into Germany while authorities establish where they first entered the EU.
By mid-June of this year, 18,349 asylum seekers had been admitted to Germany who were already entered in the European fingerprint file Eurodac and thus registered in another EU country.
But it is not just those who have arrived elsewhere in Europe who are currently allowed to cross the border. Even people who have previously been handed an entry ban by German immigration authorities can still re-enter the country.
That isn't always the case though. Jörg Radek from the German Police Union GdP told DPA that people with entry bans have to fill out a form at the border. If the form indicates that they have a new reason to claim asylum, then they are allowed to cross into the country. If police decide that there is no new reason to let them in, then they can turn them away.
Another reason why police turn people back at the border is if they have no intention of applying for asylum in Germany. For instance, if they tell police that they are on their way to Sweden to apply for protection, then they won't be allowed in.
All in all, some 7,500 people were turned away at German borders last year.

So what would 'closing' the border mean?
Seehofer, who has been Interior Minister since March, claims he only recently found out that people who have been banned from entering the country can still come back, something he describes as “a scandal.”
On Monday, the Bavarian politician announced that people who have previously been handed an entry ban will no longer be allowed to enter the country, effective immediately.
He has also handed Merkel an ultimatum: either she finds an “equivalent” solution at the European level in the next two weeks, or he will instruct border police to start turning away asylum seekers who are already registered elsewhere.
Seehofer's stated intention is to ensure that fewer migrants arrive in Germany. He clearly believes that stopping people at the border would have this effect - since the large majority of refugees have to travel through another EU country before they reach Germany.
But it’s not that simple.
There are moral issues to consider. Günther Burkhardt, head of refugee organization Pro Asyl, says that turning people away at the border could spark a ""chain reaction of rejections"" in Europe. This could deter war refugees from seeking protection in the EU - and mean the EU was no longer living up to its duties under international law.
There are also possible unintended consequences of closing the border. If countries of transit fear that they will have to take back registered migrants, they have an incentive not to collect personal data in the first place. Indeed, Germany has long accused Italy of waving through migrants. Asylum seekers themselves may also do more to evade being registered when they first enter the EU.

Securing the borders would also come at a considerable cost. The chairman of the Federal Police Union, Ernst Walter, warns that ""if you strengthen controls at the Bavarian borders, you have to do the same at other German borders so that people don't enter elsewhere.”
He explains that there are currently controls at three autobahns to Austria and some sporadic searches across the countryside, but that’s it. A determined policy of turning back asylum seekers would only be possible if the government employs several hundred more police officers, the police union warns.

					10:28 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Several injured after huge police operation at ‘rebel’ asylum home,"On Monday, a large group of migrants at a refugee centre aggressively prevented police from detaining a man who was to be deported. Authorities have now responded by sending hundreds of officers to the refugee home in Ellwangen.
During the operation at the refugee home in the Baden-Württemberg town of Ellwangen on Thursday morning, several men were taken into custody. At least one man has been taken to another location via prisoner transport.
Police have since confirmed that the arrested man was the 23-year-old Togolese man who was supposed to be deported on Monday.
Several people were injured during the police deployment. Some refugees jumped out of the windows of the building, suffering minor injuries.
Three police officers were also lightly injured, but were able to continue working. Members of the emergency services had ""a lot to do,"" a police spokesman told local reporters.
Police are also investigating evidence that the migrants at the centre had a concerted plan to prevent all deportations through collective action.
""Since there were serious statements from the migrants that if the police reappeared, they would not only defend themselves in a similar manner, they would also prepare by arming themselves,"" officials during the operation sought to find ""weapons and dangerous objects,"" the police said on Thursday.
Whether weapons have been found in the refugee home has not been confirmed.
The 23-year-old African was to be deported from the refugee home on Monday. But 150 to 200 migrants at the centre managed to forcefully prevent this.
The three police patrol cars who had turned up to detain the man saw themselves in a critical situation and decided to withdraw from the scene.
The group of migrants mainly from Africa had surrounded the patrol cars and pestered the police. Some of the men hit the police patrol cars and the vehicles were damaged as a result, the Stuttgarter Zeitung (SZ) reported.
The migrants then sent a security officer from the refugee home to act as an intermediary and gave the police an ultimatum: take the Togolese man's handcuffs off within two minutes, otherwise they would storm the entrance gate of the accommodation.
The police decided to give the security officer a key so that he could release the 23-year-old from his handcuffs.
In response to the incident, Armin Schuster of the Christian Democrats (CDU) has called for the authorities to take a tougher stance.
""In our constitutional state there are clear red lines that asylum seekers now deliberately cross almost every day,"" Schuster said.
The CDU politician said he expects to see ""political support at all levels for more tangible toughness regarding the actions of our law enforcement agencies"".
Meanwhile the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party's parliamentary group leader Alice Weidel has tweeted: ""The rule of law is being trampled on by our 'guests'. Asylum seekers who try to prevent deportations must be expelled!"""

					15:47 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Why NRW is arguably more of a 'front line' state on refugees than Italy,"The battle over migrant flows within the EU has become so fractious that various politicians have warned that Europe's future is at stake. But recently released numbers show that not all is as it seems.
The EU's rules on asylum are dysfunctional, putting far too much strain on “front line states” such as Greece and Italy, most experts tell us.
The so-called Dublin rules stipulate that asylum seekers have to apply for refugee status in the EU country in which they first arrive.
That should mean that the overwhelming majority of migrants apply for asylum in Greece or Italy, due to the fact that those countries are the primary landing points for people crossing the Mediterranean.
Italy's new populist government has accused fellow EU members of abandoning it as it struggles to cope with migrants making the perilous journey from Africa.
An often quoted figure states that more than 700,000 migrants have arrived on Italian shores since 2013. But while hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers may have arrived in Italy, UN statistics show that many didn't stick around for too long.
READ ALSO: The refugee debate - just how 'open' are Germany's borders?
The figures, first reported by Die Welt, show that no other EU state hosts a number of asylum seekers even comparable with Germany, where at the end of 2017 some 1.41 million refugees and asylum seekers lived.
France had the second highest number of asylum seekers and refugees at 402,000, while in Italy the number was 355,000.
That means that the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, which is home to 433,236 refugees and asylum seeker, has taken in more people than any EU state outside Germany - including Italy. Meanwhile the capital Berlin is currently home to more refugees and asylum seekers at 83,000 than Greece.
The numbers do not include people who have had their asylum requests rejected. At the end of 2016 an estimated half a million people who had been turned down for asylum were still living in Germany.
Figures published by the European Commission backup the claim that Germany is the country that deals with the largest weight of the asylum flow.
While Germany made 524,185 asylum decisions last year, according to Eurostat figures, Italy made 78,235 and Greece made 24,510.
According to Die Welt, this all goes to show that Germany has rarely enforced the Dublin rules over recent years, instead allowing asylum seekers to make the application in Germany.
“This comparison does not in any way show that Italy and Greece are not burdened. These heavily indebted countries don't have the means to handle the asylum flow like Germany.
“But the claim that Germany has left the coastal states on their own to handle the migration influx is simply wrong.”

In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it was ""shameful"" that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was running short of cash to aid the millions of Syrians who have fled war in their homeland and called on other wealthy countries to step up to the plate.
""As the second-largest humanitarian donor, Germany is willing to provide UNHCR with a further 116 million euros ($135 million) -- that is half of the amount currently needed -- to help Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon,"" Maas said.
""But others also need to step up. After all, the Charter talks about 'we the peoples',"" he said in reference to the UN's founding treaty.
Syrians accounted for a significant proportion of the hundreds of thousands of migrants that Germany has accepted across its border since 2015 -- an influx which has weakened Chancellor Angela Merkel politically and split the European Union.
With immigration becoming an increasingly toxic issue in Germany, Merkel's government has since repeatedly tightened immigration and asylum laws.
According to the UN, around 5.6 million Syrians are living outside the country as refugees as a result of a devastating seven-year war.
The foreign minister's speech to the body also included several thinly-veiled rebukes to US President Donald Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy.
The United Nations ""thrives on our common pledge of 'together first',"" said Maas whose center-left Social Democratic Party is a junior partner in Merkel's coalition.
Speaking of climate change, Maas also criticized governments who put ""my country first"" as he restated Germany's commitment to the internationally-backed Paris agreement to combat global warming that Trump has decided to quit."

At the same time they back a proposal to turn people back at the German border, a survey showed on Thursday.
According to a survey released by ARD on Thursday, three quarters of Germans support Angela Merkel's approach of finding a European solution to the asylum dispute which is threatening to collapse her government.
The survey also showed that the majority of those asked were in favour of rejecting at Germany's borders any refugee who had already been registered in another EU country.
Only 22 percent of those questioned during the Deutschlandtrend survey would like Germany to take a national approach. This opinion is shared by all sections of society and all party supporters (with the exception of AfD supporters, 60 percent of whom were against a European compromise).
Those surveyed were pessimistic about the way in which this dispute would be settled, with only 36 percent of respondents believing that a European solution to the refugee crisis would be found in the near future. A majority of 59 percent were sceptical that this could be achieved.
The same survey asked participants whether they were for or against refugees (who were already registered in another EU country) being rejected at the German borders. 62 percent were for this, with 31 percent saying such people should be allowed into the country.
At one end of the spectrum, 96 percent of AfD voters supported rejecting already-registered refugees at Germany's borders. But 68 percent of Green Party voters were against this on the other end of the spectrum.
Support for both coalition partners - the Christian Union (CDU/CSU) and Social Democrats (SPD) - has increased by one point since the middle of June, according to the “Sonntagsfrage” (Sunday survey).
If a general election happened on Sunday, the CDU/CSU would win 32 percent, and the SPD would win 19 percent of the votes. Support for the AfD has dropped a point to 14 percent, whilst support for the Greens is stable at 13 percent.
Die Linke has sunk one point to 9 percent and support for the Free Democrats (FDP) remains at eight percent.

Conservatives among Merkel's Christian Democrats are keen to restrict as heavily as possible so-called ""family reunifications"" that would allow some of the million-plus migrants and refugees who have arrived since 2015 to bring in relatives.
That has stirred the ire of Social Democrats (SPD), the reluctant junior partners who helped Merkel into office to end the longest period of post-election limbo in post-World War II German history.
In their painstakingly-negotiated coalition deal, the parties agreed that up to 1,000 people per month could enter Germany under family reunification, with only immediate relatives eligible.
New Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is eager to tighten the screws further, with a draft law that would prevent people dependent on social benefits from bringing in family members and further restrict which relations are eligible, including ruling out siblings.
Many people who arrived in Germany as refugees are yet to join the labour market, undergoing job training or language classes, and would therefore not qualify.
READ MORE: Life in suspense - the refugees who can't reunite with their families
Seehofer is a former leader of the ultra-conservative CSU, the smaller Bavarian sister party of Merkel's more centrist CDU.
He is keen to burnish his outfit's anti-immigration credentials ahead of a state election later this year, when they will face a stiff challenge from anti-Islam, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
""We don't want an influx into the social system. That's also how we've discussed this within the coalition,"" he told Der Spiegel magazine's Saturday edition.
Two years ago, Seehofer blasted Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to refugees arriving in Europe via the so-called ""Balkan route"" from the Middle East, saying it had produced a ""rule of injustice"" in Europe's most populous nation.
Arriving in his Berlin ministry after being ejected from the state premiership in prosperous Bavaria, he lost no time before stirring up controversy with a declaration that ""Islam does not belong to Germany"", which is home to around four million Muslims.
'Coalition would be over'
Social democrats, already smarting from the concessions made on immigration in the coalition agreement, have bristled at Seehofer's sallies in the media and at the draft law.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas declared that ""we will not agree to any draft which we consider to be mainly aimed at reducing numbers"" allowed to enter Germany.
But Seehofer's CSU party colleagues have backed him to the hilt.
""If the Social Democrats don't cooperate, the 'grand coalition' would be over"" less than a month after Merkel was sworn in, deputy leader of the conservative parliamentary group Georg Nuesslein told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.
The family reunification row is just one front in a broader battle over immigration, integration and Islam in German society that has pitted the SPD against the CDU/CSU.
Seehofer is also keen to speed up expulsions of people whose asylum applications are refused, many of whom spend months or years contesting the decisions in the courts or acquire a ""tolerated"" residence status.
After weeks of mud-slinging, some among the conservatives are uncomfortable with the relentless focus on such themes.
""The question is: do we really win elections by naming the topics that stir people up without changing anything?"" asked Armin Laschet, CDU state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Merkel will be counting on the support of moderates like Laschet to contain bubbling discontent on the right of her party.
Health Minister Jens Spahn, a rising star of the CDU's right wing seen as a potential future candidate for the chancellorship, has spent his first weeks in office giving interviews urging more ""law and order"" in troubled city districts.
He has also chided feminist pro-abortion campaigners, saying they cared more about animal rights than unborn children, and declared that long-term unemployed people were not poor.
A government spokesman said Spahn's statements were his ""personal"" views, not government policy."

With a spoon and spatula in hand, Zaid, a 23-year-old Iraqi refugee, lifts the lid on a large pot filled with goulash and potatoes as he begins his shift.
From 6:30 to 8 pm, he is employed by the city of Berlin to dish out dinner to 152 other Syrian, Iraqi, Afghan and Moldovan refugees in a sports hall, which had been turned into an emergency shelter for the newcomers.
Zaid is one of thousands of refugees who have taken on tasks ranging from repairing bicycles to pruning plants to cleaning sidewalks for pay of just over one euro ($1.1) an hour.
The so-called ""one-euro jobs"" have been touted as a springboard for the newcomers into Germany's job market, but experts remain unconvinced of their effectiveness.
At the sports gym, Zaid tries to explain to the sceptical faces crowded in front of him what went into the beef stew that he described as ""so German"".
For the work - which includes setting the table, cutting bread, serving food and then cleaning up - he is paid 1.05 euros an hour. Restricted to working no more than 20 hours a week, Zaid gets a monthly income of 84 euros at best, a small extra on top of the 143 euros he receives as pocket money while he waits for the official decision on his asylum application.
His monthly intake may be a tiny fraction of an average German wage, but Zaid takes on his job with a big smile.
""It allows me to have contact with the German volunteers who come here to distribute meals, and gives me a chance to speak the language,"" said Zaid who fled the city of Hilla, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) south of Baghdad, along with his father and sister six months ago.
""And I don't have to stand around in the centre not knowing what to do,"" he said.
'Subsidizing exclusion?'
With authorities often taking weeks, if not months, to process asylum applications, many refugees are bored out of their minds as they are not allowed to take on regular employment during that time. To get around the problem, authorities have decided to make use of the one-euro job solution.
Conceived a decade ago with the aim of nudging the long-term unemployed back to work, it is now being used to help integrate a record influx of refugees, which topped 1.1 million last year.
The city of Berlin currently employs 3,925 refugees who are lodged in 75 centres, and wants to widen the offer to associations that offer public service such as charities helping the homeless or rehabilitative shelters for alcoholics.
In Bavaria, the main gateway for thousands of refugees in southern Germany, 9,000 refugees have taken up such jobs.
The city of Hanover also offers newcomers the possibility of working in bicycle repair, or sorting donated clothes, or accompanying kindergarten children in exchange for German language classes.
Labour Minister Andrea Nahles has promised to create 100,000 such posts for refugees, describing them as a ""trampoline"" into the job market.
""In the short term, it makes sense because the refugees can't otherwise work,"" Ronald Bachmann, economist at the RWI institute told AFP.
""Having them at work also sends a good political signal,"" he said, as anti-migrant populism surges in tandem with Germany's record refugee influx.
Nevertheless, Bachmann noted that the one-euro jobs had not proven particularly successful in their original task of getting the long-term unemployed back to work.
""It was very, very rare that they helped to bring them back to a job market as one learns very little from such jobs,"" said Bachmann.
The head of the German Federation of Unions, Reiner Hoffmann, also spoke out against placing refugees in such jobs as he believed that Germany needs a far more ambitious programme to integrate the newcomers into the economy.
Holger Schaefer, an expert in the job market at IW institute, similarly had harsh words for the programme, saying ""we are in fact subsidizing the exclusion of refugees from the job market"".
In any case, Zaid has no intention of pursuing his budding career in the restaurant business. He has just signed up for a class in a Berlin high school which should help him to resume his studies in IT, which had been abruptly halted in Iraq."

Their conclusion: journalists lost their objectivity and drove a wedge through society.
As hundreds of thousands of refugees arrived in Germany in 2015 and early 2016, daily newspapers took on the role of “public educators” rather than objective critics of public policy, a team of researchers at the Otto Brenner Institute conclude, according to a report in Die Zeit this week.
The researchers, led by former Die Zeit editor Michael Haller, studied thousands of articles published between February 2015 and March 2016 by leading daily newspapers, including Bild, Die Welt, the Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
The report, which will be published on Monday, criticizes “the so-called mainstream media” for lining up behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door refugee policies, and for uncritically taking on “the slogans of the political elite.”
Journalists used the slogan Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture) to put moral pressure on citizens to contribute to the cause of supporting refugees, the study finds.
People who criticized the government policy were treated by journalists as suspect and potentially racist. At the same time, the newspapers saw it as their role to educate such people on becoming better human beings, the study argues.
“Most journalists failed in their job as someone who is supposed to objectively explain the world to readers,” Haller told Die Zeit.

News articles were often infused with the opinion of the journalist, while the opinions of normal citizens, of experts, and of asylum seekers themselves were often ignored, he added.
The report concludes that the moralistic reporting by the major newspapers “massively contributed” to a loss of trust in the mainstream media and a split in German society.
Over one million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in total in 2015 and 2016, with numbers rising sharply after the government opened its borders in late August 2015. At the height of the crisis, tens of thousands of people passed into the country every day.
The arrival of huge numbers of refugees led to the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party which consistently opposed the government’s refugee policy. In national elections in September, the AfD are predicted to become the first party further to the right of Merkel’s conservative CDU to make it into the Bundestag (German parliament) in post-war history.
The term ""Lügenpresse"" (lying press) simultaneously became a popular term used at rallies held by the AfD and the anti-Islam Pegida movement.
Newspapers and broadcasters came in for particularly harsh criticism after hundreds of women in Cologne and other cities reported being sexually assaulted at New Year celebrations at the end of 2015.
The national media took days to pick up on the story, leading critics to claim that they were afraid to report on crimes which portrayed asylum seekers in a poor light."

How many asylum seekers are there in Germany?
Since 2011, the year that the Arab Spring destabilized many Middle Eastern countries, around 1.6 million people have applied for asylum in Germany. To be exact 1.55 million first-time applications were made between 2011 and 2016, with over half of those applications coming in 2015 and 2016.

Not everyone who wants asylum is accepted - in 2017 some 39 percent of all applications were turned down.
According to the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), there are currently 600,000 people living in Germany who have been granted protection. Two thirds of these have full asylum and a third have a lesser form of asylum known as subsidiary protection.
But that isn’t the whole story. The vast majority of those who have their applications rejected stay anyway. At the end of last year some 556,499 people were still living in Germany despite being turned down for asylum. Four out of five of these people had been in the country for at least six years.
Do many asylum seekers actually come to Germany for economic reasons?
Although people on the left of the political debate call people who arrive in Germany from the developing world Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge (economic refugees), German law does not recognize poverty as a reason for granting asylum.
Data on asylum applications shows that the majority of asylum requests in 2016 were made by people from countries in which there were civil wars being fought. Last year 50.2 percent of all asylum applications (362,000 applications) were from citizens of Syria and Iraq.
The CIA estimates that there are currently 4.1 million people within Iraq who have been displaced by violent conflict among the country’s ethnic communities. In Syria, the UN estimates the death toll from the civil war at roughly 400,000 people.

A large proportion of applications in 2016 were also made by Afghans (17.6 percent), while Iranians (3.7 percent) and Eritreans (2.6 percent) applied in the fourth and fifth largest numbers. The US State Department has criticized the human rights records of all of these countries.
Still, there is anecdotal evidence that some people lie about their reasons for leaving home, such as the recent case of a man on trial for murder who told German authorities his father died fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Prosecutors found out that the father was alive and well in Iran.
German authorities appear to be aware of this possibility, spending more time considering cases from countries where there is no civil war. While a Syrian waited four months on average for a decision in 2016, Eritreans had to wait nine months and Iranians 15 months.
Nonetheless, whether authorities are any good at spotting a fake was called into question in dramatic fashion early this year. When a German soldier was arrested for plotting a far-right crime that he wanted to pin on refugees, it emerged that he himself had submitted an asylum application and gained asylum by posing as a Syrian refugee - despite speaking no Arabic.
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) did not respond to a request from The Local to provide information on the number of asylum requests which are deliberately deceptive. But the fact that 39 percent have been turned down this year suggests BAMF believes that roughly four in ten people come to Germany who aren't refugees according to the legal definition.

Does the German government spend more on refugees than German citizens?
In 2015 Germany spent around €16 billion on refugees, that is 0.5 percent of GDP. This is significantly more than the 0.01 percent of GDP the US spent on its refugee programme in the same year, but less than the 1.35 percent of GDP spent in Sweden.
Last year the federal government also agreed to give the 16 federal states an additional €8 billion until 2018 for the integration of refugees.
This is obviously a very substantial amount of money and the government has been criticized for its reluctance over years to invest in public infrastructure before pulling an extra few billion out of the hat to spend on refugees.
As for social welfare, the payments refugees receive are complex and depend on the status the refugee has. There are no circumstances though, in which refugees have more rights than Germans.
When refugees first arrive in the country they are entitled to expenses “which cover their basic needs.” Local authorities can decide whether this is given in the form of food and clothing or whether refugees are given a small amount of money.
Refugees living in refugee homes are also entitled to “pocket money.” For single adults this is €135 per month. For couples this is €122 each. Parents also receive between €79 and €83 a month, depending on the age of their child.
All of these payments are lower than the base welfare payments to German citizens. An unemployed German is given €409 per month as the lowest rate of welfare. Meanwhile German parents receive child benefits starting at €192 per month.
When someone is given full asylum and they live independently, they are entitled to the same benefits as German citizens. This right is enshrined in the German constitution.
Are refugees capable of integrating into the job market?
A survey of over 70 percent of adult asylum seekers in 2015 showed that education levels vary widely from country to country. While three quarters of Syrians arrived in Germany with at least a high school education, more than half of respondents from Afghanistan had only been to primary school at best.
Research by the OECD suggests that refugees in Europe tend to lag behind the native populations in terms of employment. A 2014 report found that refugee employment rates are around 20 percent lower than those for native populations with similar educational backgrounds.
Germany does not collect job figures on refugees. But statistics for citizens of the eight most significant countries of origin for refugees give approximate data. This shows employment levels much lower than among the general population. Whereas just five percent of Germans were unemployed in September, 45 percent of people from these eight countries were not in employment.
The Federal Job Agency notes that ""poor language skills and a lack of formal training make it difficult for refugees to integrate into the job market"", warning that ""a deep breath is needed"" in overcoming these problems.

The good news is that the proportion of refugees who are registered as unemployed dropped by 7.4 percent in a year (although most of these people have gone into further education courses rather than employment).
German employers who have hired refugees have been pleased with the work they have done. An OECD survey carried out earlier this year with over 2,000 employers found that around 80 percent were satisfied with the work done by refugees in their employment.
There is also clearly a desire on the part of refugees to find employment. A survey by BAMF in 2016 showed that 86 percent of male refugees and 60 percent of female ones said they “definitely want to work.”
Will refugees stay in Germany for good?
A survey of refugees conducted in 2015 showed that 85 percent of all respondents wanted to stay in Germany indefinitely. Afghans and Iraqis were most likely to say this, with Syrians being relatively more likely to say that they weren’t sure what they would do in the future.
But being able to stay isn’t just dependent on the wishes of the individual. The Integration Act, brought in in 2016, tightened the rules for gaining permanent residence. If refugees have A2 level German and can for the most part support themselves financially they should be able to gain permanent residence after five years in the country.
The situation is more complicated for people who have been offered subsidiary protection. People granted this lesser form of asylum are given a residence permit for one year which can be extended for a further two.
Whatever the rules are though, Germany only deports a fraction of the people who have their asylum requests rejected. Figures from last year show that, of the half a million people still living in Germany who had their requests rejected, 39 percent had been here longer than six years. Meanwhile almost half of this number have been given an ""unlimited right of residence"".
Would allowing family reunions drastically increase arrivals?
The questions of whether Familiennachzug (family reunifications) should be allowed for the 200,000 people who currently hold subsidiary protection status was one of the sticking points that brought down the first attempt at building a German government this autumn.
As things currently stand, people with subsidiary protection don’t have the right to family reunifications. That is up for review in March, though. The Green party were adamant that these refugees should be allowed the chance to bring immediate family to Germany. But the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) disagreed - fearing that a second wave of migration would further erode its support base.
In fact, research by the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS) suggests that allowing family reunifications would have a minimal effect on overall refugee numbers, with only 50,000 to 60,000 more people coming to Germany as a result. This is because many people with subsidiary protection either already live with their families or are single adults who have no “direct” family as it is defined by German law.

					15:41 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Merkel cabinet agrees law change to let all refugees bring families to Germany,"The German government agreed on Wednesday to a change in the law which allows refugees with “subsidiary protection” to start bringing their families to Germany. But the law still limits how many can arrive each month.
Refugees with subsidiary protection will be allowed to bring relatives back to Germany as of August 1st. A corresponding change in the residence law was passed by the federal cabinet in Berlin on Wednesday.
Currently, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection - many of whom are civil war refugees from Syria - are only allowed to bring relatives to Germany in rare cases. But the new rules would allow for their spouses and underage children of all people with this status to apply to join them.
People granted full refugee status are already allowed to bring their families to Germany.
The change to the law will now be put to debate in the Bundestag (German parliament) and is likely to meet fierce resistance from the opposition.
On the left side of the political spectrum, the Green party and Die Linke feel that the law change does not go far enough, as it limits the monthly arrivals to 1,000 relatives.
Meanwhile, the anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) wants to abolish family reunification for refugees altogether. The pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) want to maintain the status quo, which allows for reunifications in exceptional circumstances.
Subsidiary protection is lower than full refugee status. Germany has been increasingly granting it to refugees from Syria who cannot prove that they are individually targeted by government persecution.
In 2015 subsidiary protection was almost never granted. Of a total 282,726 cases which were decided that year, a minuscule 1,707 fell under this category. But in 2016 that number jumped to 153,700, which was 22.1 percent of all cases.
Parents of unaccompanied minor refugees living in Germany with this temporary status could also apply for a visa under the new rule change.
At present, 26,000 applications for subsidiary protection have already been submitted to German missions abroad.
The coalition also wants to exclude terrorist sympathizers, agitators or so-called “dangerous persons” from family reunification in its bill. However, exceptions should also be possible here for people who now credibly distance themselves from their previous actions.

					14:49 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Refugees left anxious over future after Bremen asylum scandal,"Many refugees in the city of Bremen are worried that they could face deportation after a major scandal at the city’s immigration authority, where officials allegedly took bribes in return for offering asylum.
“They are afraid that their residence status will be changed or that they could be threatened with deportation,” Marc Millies from the Bremen Refugee Council said on Friday.
The Federal Office for Immigration and Refugees (BAMF) wants to reassess 18,000 decisions made by their Bremen office, after prosecutors started an investigation into claims that employees there took bribes in return for granting asylum.
Prosecutors suspect that more than 1,200 people were granted asylum between 2013 and 2016 who did not have actual grounds for being offered protection.
Bertold Reetz, an employee at Inneren Mission, an organization that runs nine refugee homes in Germany’s smallest state, also called for the presumption of innocence to be applied to refugees there.
“Of course this case needs to be investigated. It is important that the BAMF follows correct procedures,” he said, before adding that the sweeping reassessments “are a little bit like placing everyone under suspicion of a crime.”
In view of the scandal, the Interior Ministry has placed a moratorium on any new asylum decision being taken in Bremen.
But Reetz described this as “crazy”, saying that this decision would only lead to overcrowding in the refugee homes. He pointed out that no migrants are allowed to leave the refugee homes and find normal housing before a final decision on their status has been made.
Millies from the Refugee Council also stressed that the Interior Ministry's decision could slow down integration in the city.
""Language courses and school visits will be delayed through this,"" he said.

					17:47 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,Germany took in 160 times more Syrian refugees in 2016 than UK,"Of the 406,000 Syrian refugees given protection in Europe in 2016, almost 300,000 were offered sanctuary in Germany, new figures show.
The figures released by Eurostat on Wednesday display in clear terms how a few countries have shared the majority of the burden in taking in refugees from war-torn Syria.
While Germany took in 295,000 of the 406,000 Syrians who were granted asylum in the EU during 2016, major economies such as France and and Great Britain failed to offer protection to more than a few thousand.
The UK offered protection to 1,850 Syrians, 160 times less than Germany.
Sweden was the country which bore the second largest share of the burden, taking in 44,905 Syrians.
Germany also offered asylum or subsidiary protection to three quarters of the 66,000 Iraqis who were offered protection during this time in the EU, and to around 60 percent of all Afghans.
A total of 710,000 positive decisions were made on asylum cases in the EU during 2016, with 445,000 of these being made in Germany.
In Europe as a whole, 55 percent of the offers of protection were for full refugee status, 37 percent were for subsidiary protection, and eight percent were authorization to stay for humanitarian reasons.
While both refugee and subsidiary protection status are defined by EU law, humanitarian status is granted on the basis of national legislation.
But despite the EU rules for who should be determined a refugee, there were drastic differences in recognition rates from country to country.
While Germany and Sweden both offered asylum in 69 percent of first instance decisions, the UK offered it in 32 percent of cases, and Hungary in only eight percent of cases.
Throughout the refugee crisis, Germany argued for a quota system that would distribute refugees across the 28 member states of the European Union according to indices such as economic growth and unemployment.
But the proposal met with fierce resistance from eastern European states, while countries largely failed to live up to their pledges on a pilot project for the quota."

					15:43 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,10 things to know about refugees and asylum in Germany,"Two years after the German government effectively opened its borders to asylum seekers, leading to the arrival of over a million people, we look at the key facts and statistics on refugees in Germany.
1. Germany is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention
Like all EU member states Germany is bound by the Convention on the Status of Refugees. The convention defines refugees as those who face persecution in their home country based on religion, race, sexuality, membership of a particular social group, or for holding certain political beliefs.
Germany has a duty to these people not to subject them to discriminatory laws and to offer them the chance to assimilate.
2. Germany is bound by the EU's ""Dublin rules""
Germany is also a signatory of Dublin III, an EU agreement which sets out how member states deal with refugees who arrive in the country. According to the agreement asylum requests must be dealt with in the first country the refugee enters.
This agreement is controversial as it puts a disproportionate pressure on countries like Italy and Greece which have external EU borders, while protecting countries like Germany which are surrounded by other EU members.
In reality Germany appears to enforce the Dublin rules half-heartedly. Despite most refugees arriving via land through Austria, only a small proportion of asylum decisions reference the Dublin agreement. In the first half of 2017 immigration authorities ruled in only 5.6 percent of cases that a refugee should go back to the first EU country they entered.
3. 2016 was record year for asylum applications
When hundreds of thousands of refugees arrived in the autumn of 2015 they didn't all apply for asylum at once. Because there was already a long backlog with the immigration authorities, many waited until 2016.
That meant that last year smashed the record for asylum requests - 745,545 applications were lodged during the course of the year. 2015 was the second highest number of applications in German history, with 476,649 being made. In the first six months of 2017 the numbers have fallen off sharply to 128,903.
4. Western Germany is a refugee hot-spot
Young refugees in Essen, NRW. Photo: DPA
North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) is the largest of Germany's 16 states in terms of population. It also has a high immigrant population in comparison with the rest of the country. So its perhaps not surprising that most asylum applications are registered there.
Still, the number of applications outstrips NRW's relative population size. While 21 percent of the country lives in NRW, 27 percent of asylum applications were lodged there in 2016.
The wealthy southern states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria are second most popular with asylum seekers - together they received slightly over 20 percent of applications last year.
5. Most applications come from men
Asylum seekers are more likely to be male then female, although the balance changes somewhat from year to year. In 2016 two in every three asylum seekers were male, while so far this year 38 percent have been female.
Interestingly refugees over 55 are more likely to be women, but this age group makes up a very small proportion of overall applications.
6. Babies are now most likely to apply for asylum
Government figures show that two age groups are particularly likely to be asylum seekers in Germany. The first is young people aged between the ages of 18 and 30, of whom the large majority are male. The second group is very young children under the age of four.
Almost one in every four asylum applications lodged this year have been on behalf of children under the age of four. By contrast children aged 4 to 6 made up only 3 percent of all applications.
In 2016 four in ten asylum requests came from youths between the ages of 18 and 30, while 11 percent were made on behalf of babies and toddlers.
7. Afghans are applying in smaller numbers

At the end of 2016 Berlin began controversial deportations of Afghans back to their homeland. Critics have decried this policy, pointing to the fact that the Taliban still controls large parts of a country where the security situation has deteriorated in recent years.
The policy has also possibly discouraged Afghans from seeking asylum in Germany. Whereas in 2016 some 18 percent of all asylum requests came from the south Asian country, that dropped to 9 percent in the first half of this year.
Syrians made up the largest group of requests in 2016 and in the first half of 2017. Civil war broke out in the Middle Eastern state in 2011 with the estimated death toll of upwards of 321,000 people.
8. Success of applications is going down
So far in 2017 roughly 44 percent of the 444,359 asylum decisions have been in favour of the applicant. But not all of those have been granted full asylum. In fact in all of the cases ruled on in the first half of the year less than a quarter (22 percent) were granted full asylum. Others were given ""subsidiary protection"" or were left in no man's land with authorities being banned from deporting them.
And applicants' chances of receiving any sort of protection are becoming slimmer. A total of 62 percent of cases were approved in 2016, an approval rate 18 percent higher than so far this year.
9. Subsidiary protection is rising
In 2015 the type of asylum known as ""subsidiary protection"" was almost never granted. Of a total 282,726 cases which were decided that year, a minuscule 1,707 fell under this category. But in 2016 that number jumped to 153,700, which was 22.1 percent of all cases.
Subsidiary protection is controversial because the government ruled in early 2016 that people granted it can't bring their families to Germany. At the same time as this rule changed the number of people being given subsidiary protection sky-rocketed.
Critics have asked why asylum seekers coming from the countries where conditions have not improved are now being given a lesser form of protection.
10. 2017 set to break record for asylum decisions
The immigration authorities often have faced accusations of inefficiency during the refugee influx. Angela Merkel actually sacked the head of BAMF in 2015 and brought in US consultancy firm McKinsey to try and streamline the process.
And the process is speeding up. In 2016 almost 700,000 decisions were made on asylum cases, by far the largest in the history of the Bundesrepublik. But 2017 is on course to beat that record with close to 450,000 decisions made in the first half of the year.
But two years after the refugee crisis hit its zenith, many people are still waiting to hear of their fate."

					12:28 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Merkel pleads for more humanity in refugee debate,"During a speech in Berlin on Wednesday evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel appealed to Germans to put themselves into the shoes of people fleeing war and persecution.
“People’s personal stories show us that fleeing from home isn’t something abstract - it is about human lives,” Merkel said during a speech at a memorial ceremony for refugees from the Second World War.
“The vast majority of those fleeing are victims,” she added.
Merkel went on to say that anyone who has not personally experienced being expelled from their homes can barely understand the suffering involved “but we can attempt to understand it.”
“We can listen and learn so that no new suffering comes about because we live in denial, or ignore what is going on.”
The Chancellor is currently embroiled in a bitter dispute with her Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who wants Germany to pursue a much tougher approach to asylum seekers.
Seehofer has already ensured that Germany caps the number of refugees who arrive in the country at 200,000 per year. He is now also trying to push through a new border policy which would allow Germany to turn back refugees at the border.
Merkel, in an apparent jibe at Seehofer, on Wednesday evening described migration as “a European challenge”.
The Chancellor has stuck to her position that Germany should not seek to alter its border policies without first coming to agreement with the EU members where refugees enter the bloc.
“It isn’t good if one [state] makes a decision that come at a cost for others,” she said during her speech.

					17:14 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Are refugees really going back to war zones 'on holiday'?,"A major German newspaper reported this week that refugees are travelling back to their homelands ""on vacation"" and then coming back again to Germany. But experts tell The Local this isn't really the case.
A Die Welt report titled “Refugees go on holiday to where they were persecuted” has been raising eyebrows this week as people question how this could happen.
The report was based on cases being reported by Berlin labour agencies that some recognized refugees, who are also registered as unemployed, travelled back to Syria, Afghanistan or Lebanon, and later returned to Germany.
Die Welt did not have a number for how many people had done this in Berlin, but said that sources familiar with the process assumed refugees were doing this across the country.
The Federal Employment Agency also did not have concrete numbers for how many refugees had gone back and forth, stating only that “there are such cases”.
People receiving Hartz-IV welfare benefits are entitled to 21 days of being absent from their registered location. But there is no rule that a recipient disclose the location of where they are going to authorities, and there is no legal basis to demand this information from them.
But experts also told The Local that this report didn't provide the full picture.
“Die Welt's research has very little reliable information,” Karl Kopp from advocacy group Pro Asyl and NGO network the European Council on Refugees and Exiles told The Local.
“This report raises many more questions than it answers.”
Here's a look at what we learned when we looked into the issue more.
A few cases versus a ‘national phenomenon'
While Die Welt suggested that refugees going on short trips back to their home countries could be a national phenomenon, experts The Local spoke to said this was not the case.
""With certainty, we cannot refer to this as a national phenomenon,"" a spokesperson from the Federal Employment Agency told The Local.
Berlin-based Martin Rentsch from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) told The Local that refugees leaving Germany for their homelands and then coming back could not be called ""widespread.""
""I don't have concrete numbers, but if you look at the situation in Syria or Iraq, I don't think that this is a widespread phenomenon,” Rentsch said.
“In contrast to migrants, refugees are fleeing from war and persecution. They left everything behind and can't go back to their home country.”
Kopp from Pro Asyl also said that there were no indications that it was a “major phenomenon”.
Legally, anyone who has refugee status and goes back to their homeland - no matter the reason - risks losing their protected status if they try to come back to Germany.
Under the Geneva refugee convention, anyone who voluntarily has “re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality” will lose refugee status.
And Kopp noted that there is no legal obligation to give refugees travel passes.
The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) told DPA that they were looking into the Die Welt report, but that anyone who had made such a journey home would be checked once they meet border or airport customs officials upon their return to Germany.
Vacation or family emergency
Critics have also taken issue with Die Welt referring to refugees travelling back to their home countries as “vacation”.
Kopp claimed that if someone who had already gained refugee status were to leave Germany, it would generally be because of a serious family situation, such as a death or terminal illness.
“Most of the asylum seekers that I know suffer greatly if they don't get to travel to the funeral of their mother or father in their homeland,” Kopp said. “The talk of ‘vacation' is completely out of place and simply stokes resentment.”
Kopp also said that more often, a refugee might meet family members somewhere else like Turkey.
“The fact is that refugees travel to neighbouring states in order to meet family members,” he said. “Refugees travel to their region of origin because their closest family members might be sick or dead.”
A Syrian refugee and writer for the German Huffington Post also took issue with Die Welt calling such travels “vacation”.
“We're not splashing in the sea and then flying back to Germany relaxed with candy or other souvenirs in our luggage,” Aras Bacho wrote.
He explained that as a young man, he has never dared to return to Syria, for fear that he would be imprisoned or forced to join the Syrian military. But some older parents might try to see their children one last time.
“In Syria there is war, not a holiday mood.”
Die Welt report does reveal loophole
Still, the Die Welt report did reveal a potential lapse in communication between government agencies. If an advisor in the Employment Agency gets wind that someone wants to go to Syria, for example, Die Welt reported they are not supposed to pass this information along due to data protection issues.
A Federal Employment Agency spokesperson explained to The Local that their office does not record absences of benefits recipients, but reports would be made to local job centres.
A BAMF spokeswoman told DPA that “there is not a special communication line between BAMF and the Employment Agency and/or the immigration authorities for this purpose, but it is being looked into.”
Still, BAMF added that those who do return back from trips to their homelands are then reviewed for withdrawal of their refugee status.

					17:03 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Majority of Germans oppose refugees reuniting with their families: survey,"A survey commissioned by Bild newspaper published on Tuesday reveals that the majority of Germans reject the idea of refugees legally reuniting with their families in Germany.
Over 58 percent of interviewees rejected the notion of refugee family reunification whereas around 42 percent supported it, the survey showed.
People granted full asylum have a right to reunite with their close family as stipulated by the Geneva Convention. According to the Bild report, there has been an increase in the number of family reunion visas Germany has issued in recent years. From January 2015 to the end of June 2017, around 230,000 requests for this visa were granted.
Nonetheless, many asylum seekers in Germany are only granted subsidiary protection, a secondary form of asylum which offers fewer rights. Even Syrians are by and large only offered subsidiary protection, unless they can show that they as an individual face persecution in their homeland.
In March 2016 the German government decided to delay decisions on family reunification for people offered subsidiary protection until March 2018.
In a recent discussion Merkel had at the federal press centre in Berlin, Merkel said she would only make firm decisions about family reunification for particular groups of refugees in 2018 if she is re-elected as Chancellor, according to die Welt.
Another finding in the survey revealed that significantly more women (62.1 percent) than men (54.5 percent), more east Germans (66.8 per cent) than west Germans (56.5 percent) and more middle-aged respondents (69.2 per cent) than youthful respondents (49.1 per cent) rejected family reunion amongst refugees.
There were significant differences according to the political parties the interviewees aligned themselves with too.
Alternative for Germany (AfD) supporters (95.8 per cent) and Free Democratic Party (FDP) supporters (66.8 per cent) reject reunification among refugee families much more strongly than supporters of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Conservative CDU party and Bavarian sister party CSU (54.3 per cent).
The Left Party (Die Linke) and the Social Democrats (SPD) hover around the middle at 52.2 percent and 42.7 percent, respectively.
With weeks to go until the September 24th general election, the issue of migration could be a decisive factor for Merkel as she seeks a fourth term.
Merkel's popularity plunged after the arrival of nearly 900,000 asylum seekers from the world's crisis zones last year, but has recovered of late.

					15:38 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Police investigating after far-right crowd shout to 'sink' refugee rescue boat ,"German prosecutors told The Local on Tuesday that police are investigating a video in which a crowd at a far-right rally shouts enthusiastically to “sink” refugees.
“Sink! Sink! Sink!” shouts a crowd at a rally of the far-right Pegida movement in the east German city of Dresden. The video of the incident, which has been circling online, is now the subject of a police investigation, state prosecutors confirmed to The Local on Tuesday.
It appears the crowd's chant refers to refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean and comes after speaker Siegfried Däbritz raises the subject of Mission Lifeline, a German volunteer boat which had until recently been rescuing migrants at sea.
“I'm sure you've heard what's happening in the Mediterranean with our all-time favourite smuggler organization...right?” says speaker Däbritz.
“Absaufen!” chant the crowd, which translates in English to ""sink."" The chant is repeated seven times before Däbritz interrupts:
""No, no, don't sink,"" he says with a grin. ""We need the ship to take them all back again.”
At the time of the Pegida rally, on June 25th, the Mission Lifeline crew was at sea with 234 migrants waiting for a European port to allow it to dock.
Days later, it was given permission to land in Malta, where it was impounded. The boat's German captain, Claus-Peter Reisch, is now facing charges of sailing in Maltese waters without proper registration.
The full video of Däbritz's speech was first posted on June 25th on the Facebook account of Pegida founder Lutz Bachmann with the instructions ""share, share, share.""
It was edited on Tuesday to remove the offending chant - but not before The Local was able to watch the full incident in context.
A spokesman for the Dresden public prosecutor's office confirmed to The Local on Tuesday that police were investigating the incident after a tip-off from the Rheinische Post newspaper, which first reported the story.
Bachmann and Däbritz are co-founder of the anti-Islam, anti-immigration movement Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamification of the West) which has held weekly rallies in Dresden and other German cities since 2014.
Mission Lifeline co-founder Axel Steier told the newspaper on Monday that he isn't surprised by the Pegida crowd's behaviour, adding that the volunteers have to keep their Dresden office address secret for fear of being attacked.
Steier demanded Pegida rallies be shut down whenever crowds call for violence against refugees."

					12:28 CET+01:00				", The Local,Teen refugee banished from east German town after knife attack,"The town of Cottbus in Brandenburg has taken the unusual step of telling a resident to pack his bags and leave, after he was reportedly involved in an assault at a shopping centre.
Mayor of Cottbus, Holger Kelch, decided on Tuesday that the teenage asylum seeker and his father would have to move away from the town and the surrounding district, according to the German Press Agency (DPA). Kelch came to the decision after consulting with local police and immigration authorities.
The 15 year old was allegedly one of three teenagers involved in an assault on a 51-year-old man at a shopping centre in the town centre on Friday.
According to police, the three youths accosted the man and his wife as they tried to enter a shopping centre. The youths, aged 14, 15 and 17, allegedly demanded that they enter the building first and said that the woman needed to show them “respect.”
When the couple refused to cooperate with their demands, the 14-year-old reportedly attacked the man with a knife. A passerby was able to intervene and the three youths fled. The man did not sustain serious injuries.
City authorities have now decided to banish the 15-year-old from the city as he had already been classified as ""dangerous"" in December of last year. The city has handed him a “negative residency permit”, an order which local authorities are allowed to hand to asylum seekers.
“It is the first time that we have made use of the negative residency permit,” a city official told the Lausitzer Rundschau. “The integration of the youth has failed.”
Refugee associations have previously criticized the negative residency permit as an infringement on the basic right to freedom of movement.
Last year it was implemented in the towns of Salzgitter, Delmenhorst and Wilhelmshaven for all refugees, after the towns said they had reached their capacity for integrating new arrivals.
The other two suspects in the Cottbus knife attack have now also been added to the list of ""dangerous"" people and will be warned of legal consequences should they be suspected of breaking the law again.
Police are now investigating all three of the juveniles on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm. They have also increased patrols of the city centre in response to the assault."

					15:09 CEST+02:00				",Tom Barfield,Five ways you can help refugees in Germany,"The Local's pointers for how to get started if you're interested in donating your money, unwanted possessions, time or skills to help refugees in Germany.
The Local is a news site primarily aimed at ""expats"" - a term that in itself is loaded with the reality that while some groups have been able to travel to Germany relatively easily to start a new life, a much larger number of people face extraordinary difficulties as asylum seekers.
If you'd like to even out the balance a little, here are some places where you can get started.
If you only speak English, we suggest getting a German-speaking friend to help you get started.
But with many Germans speaking excellent English you should be able to make your way given the first push.
As a spokesman for the Evangelical Church told The Local on Thursday, ""the advantage of English speakers is that it's the most common second language among the refugees.""
If you want to inform yourself about the situation of refugees in Germany and how you can help this post from Collidoscope Berlin is a good place to start.
1. Host a refugee in your home
Check out the Refugees Welcome website – you can register your flat if you have space and they will put you in touch with a person in need of accommodation.
""We don't like the idea of putting these people into one place where many, many live,"" co-founder Mareike Geiling told NPR, adding that in official homes they can ""stay for years doing nothing, because they are not allowed to do anything"".
If you can't offer space, you can donate money to help a refugee pay rent here.
In Berlin, a more traditional German charity organization run by the Evangelical Church, the Evangelisches Jugend- und Fürsorgewerk (EJF), also runs a programme placing refugees in private homes, complementing the work of overloaded local authorities.
""Waiting for asylum applications to be processed can take a few months or up to a year and a half,"" EJF spokesman Ewald Möller told The Local.
As well as finding space in flats owned by private individuals and from the large housing companies in and around Berlin, the EJF educates refugees about accessing the private housing market in Germany.
If you think you could help, email wohnraum-fuer-fluechtlinge@ejf.de. There is also a flyer with an FAQ (in German) here.
In other states, check the website of your local Flüchtlingsrat (refugee council) for similar projects.
2. Donate some clothes, a computer, or supplies
If you have some spare clothes lying around, then the Deutsche Kleiderstiftung (Clothing Foundation) accepts donations at containers in Berlin, Hamburg, Brunswick, Hanover, Magdeburg and many other cities, as well as in many churches.
Check for a location near you here – or you can always send in a package by post for free.
Some organizations are looking for laptops and other computer equipment that can help refugees communicate with family, orient themselves in a strange country and learn German.
Some Labdoo ""hubs"" are organizing donations to refugees. Near Berlin, Refugees Emancipation e.V. in Potsdam needs laptops, monitors, computers and tablets to organize computer courses for people in need.
Get in touch with a hub near you to see if your old laptop can get a new lease of life for a refugee.
And check Wie kann ich helfen? (How can I help?), who have a regularly-updated interactive map (embedded below) with organizations asking for donations of food and other perishables as well as more durable aid.
4. Register as a volunteer
Every city in Germany has organizations working to help refugees establish themselves.
In Berlin, there is even an English-language charity directed at helping expats volunteer to teach, called Give Something Back to Berlin.
For German speakers, you can get in touch with the Berliner Stadtmission.
You could also volunteer to help translate for refugees by registering at ref.connect.
There are too many organizations all over Germany to list here, so get in touch with the Flüchtlingsrat in your state to find out more about how people are organizing near you.
Another valuable resource is Wie kann ich helfen? (How can I help?), which also provides an interactive map with links to projects all over Germany.
The posts range from calls for food or in-kind donations to opportunities to teach German or English or help refugees deal with the authorities.
4. Foster an under-aged refugee
Many under-aged refugees arrive with no family members and find themselves in the care of the state in a foreign country.
German-speakers can report to the Jugendamt in their town and let them know you are willing to take care of an under-aged refugee. There is an application process that may take some time and effort to get through.
Nuremberg's Jugendamt warned Die Welt in May that potential carers should know that many young refugees are traumatized by their experiences of war and flight.
5. Donate money
If you're in a hurry, you can donate quickly and easily to the Deutsches Rotes Kreuz (German Red Cross), Save The Children or Aktion Deutschland Hilft (German Aid Action) online from the comfort of your sofa.
And the German Central Institute for Social Questions (DZI) has a list (in German) of national, international and local organizations that you can donate money to that will reach refugees where it's needed.
Thanks to Finding Berlin and all the other organizations mentioned in the article.

					09:32 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Obama thanks Merkel for open refugee policy,"US President Barack Obama made a special thank you to Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany on Tuesday at the United Nations, praising her for doing ""the right thing"".
Obama addressed world leaders at the UN in New York on Tuesday, speaking on the topic of the international refugee crisis and the need for countries to collaborate more to take care of those fleeing violent wars.
“I want to personally thank Chancellor Merkel and [Canadian] Prime Minister Trudeau, and the people of both those countries - because the politics sometimes can be hard, but it's the right thing to do,” Obama said.
“It is a crisis of our shared security. Not because refugees are a threat. Refugees, most of whom are women and children, are often fleeing war and terrorism. They are victims. They're families who want to be safe and to work, be good citizens and contribute to their country.”
Obama also went on to say that the world must learn from the international “failure” of countries in the past who refused to take in Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany.
“I believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment.”
Meanwhile Merkel has been facing increased pressure at home to further tighten her liberal refugee policies, especially since her party has lost votes in recent elections to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, including in the typically left-leaning capital of Berlin.
The Chancellor admitted this week that Germany had been unprepared for the hundreds of thousands of refugees that applied for asylum last year, making these statements a day after her party slipped to just 18 percent of the vote and the AfD shot up to 14 percent in the Berlin election.
Merkel also promised that there would not be another mass movement of asylum seekers into the country as there was last year.
But she also continued to defend her decisions as “political and ethical” and was confident about the country's ability to integrate refugees.
Obama, too, stressed the ethical obligation to assist the world's refugees.
“If we were to turn refugees away simply because of their background or religion, or, for example, because they are Muslim, then we would be reinforcing terrorist propaganda that nations like my own are somehow opposed to Islam, which is an ugly lie that must be rejected in all of our countries by upholding the values of pluralism and diversity,” the US president said.
“This crisis is a test of our common humanity - whether we give in to suspicion and fear and build walls, or whether we see ourselves in another.”
“To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values… It would be to ignore a teaching at the heart of so many faiths that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us; that we welcome the stranger in our midst.”"

					17:04 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Germany 'grossly' failing female refugees on sexual violence: report,"A investigation by news service Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) carried out in Berlin's refugee camps has found that women in the camps face ""grossly inadequate protection from sexual and gender-based violence.""
Dozens of the women that IRIN spoke to reported facing sexual harassment while living at Berlin shelters, and many said that they were offered very little support, and lived in constant fear of attack.
One of the main problems highlighted in the report released on Wednesday, was that the standards introduced by the government in June last year on protecting women, which include strict codes of conduct for guards, have still not been adequately introduced.
While there were some shelters that had trained the staff to protect against sexual assault, the standards were not legally binding, meaning that most workers were left without proper training. This has left many women at risk of violence.
The report further outlined that women often feel like the security guards in the camps were more of a threat than a protection.
Sally Abazeed, a 20-year-old refugee from Damascus, told IRIN how she had been repeatedly pestered by one guard at the camp, who tried to kiss her and always asked for her phone number. She also recounted being followed into the toilets at night by a guard.
The young Syrian fled the camp but ended up being raped by a countryman who claimed he wanted to help her. When she reported the crime to the police, she was told she did not have enough evidence and was sent back to her refugee shelter without the offer of counselling.
Only after three suicide attempts did Abazeed receive therapy from social workers.
Another woman, Zina, told of how she was scared to go to the toilet at night because the guards would make “inappropriate noises and gestures”.
While some charities have set up “mobile help units” to try and provide support and counselling for women who have suffered sexual assault, they report not being able to provide enough care because of the scale of the problem.
IRIN described how one counselling group, Lara, provided support for 190 women between October and December 2016, and two thirds of them had suffered sexual violence.
Another Berlin group to end violence against women, BIG, is reported to only have one social worker who last year in November and December spoke to 84 women who had suffered domestic or sexual violence in the shelters.
The Regional Office of Refugee Affairs (LAF) however denied that there was a problem.
“After countless conversations with shelter managers, I can assure you that there is no unusual occurrence [of sexualized violence] reported from emergency or community shelters,” said Sascha Langenbach, LAF's spokesman.
But several women's groups contacted by IRIN said that the scale of the problem was seriously under-reported, as women who didn't know their rights in Germany often didn't go to the authorities.
According to the same organizations, there is a need for women-only shelters that is not being met by the state."

					10:46 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,"Prevention improvement is solution to refugee crime, study finds","A recent study suggests that refugees would resort to less violence if they had better exposure to education, extracurricular activities and female influence.
Criminologists are calling for better prevention measures to deal with violence committed by refugees, following the release of a study shared with the German Press Agency (DPA) and the Süddeutsche Zeitung, among others. The study recommends refugees have access to language courses, sports, internships and more exposure to women.
The authors of the Ministry of Family Affairs-commissioned study are forensic scientists Christian Pfeiffer, Dirk Baier and Sören Kliem.The trio examined the increase in violent crimes observed in Germany over the past two years, according to police crime statistics.
In the federal state of Lower Saxony, the authors draw a link between increased violence and the influx of refugees: between 2014 and 2016, the number of police-recorded acts of violence in Lower Saxony rose by 10.4 percent – 92.1 percent of this increase can be attributed to refugees. This is not surprising, according to the study, in that a noticeable proportion of refugees are young men in the age range in which people are increasingly delinquent.
SEE ALSO: Why are refugees disproportionately likely to be suspects in sexual assault cases?
However, the authors point out that violent crimes committed by refugees for various reasons are reported at least twice as often as those committed by German perpetrators. A further role is played by placing refugees of different origins and religions in cramped accommodations, which encourages violence.
One third of the victims of refugee violence are other refugees, the study finds. Ninety percent of the killings in which the refugees have been identified as suspects were the victims of other refugees or foreigners. This was also the case for three-quarters of serious bodily harm caused by refugees. According to the study, people with good future prospects were less likely to be convicted.
A lack of female influence
An important aspect of the problem, the study found, is that refugees in Germany often live in groups of men – without a partner, mother, sister or other female reference person.
“The lack of women is having a negative impact everywhere,“ says criminologist Pfeiffer. This shortage increases the risk that young men will orient themselves ""towards masculinity norms that legitimize violence,“ the study states. Pfeiffer thus considers the idea of family reunification to be ""not so dumb.“
The scientists also believe that it makes sense to have an immigration law that clearly sets out the conditions under which foreigners can be naturalized. This creates a strong incentive for them to commit themselves to the fulfilment of the immigration requirements,“ the study states and suggests that rejected asylum seekers should also receive more support in their home country. In return, the state should inject more funding for projects in the refugees' home countries.
On Tuesday evening's news broadcast of Heute Journal, Pfeiffer, who was the former director of the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony, called for new perspectives in the refugee policy in upcoming coalition negotiations.

					13:36 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,German doctors criticize age tests for refugee minors,"While conservative politicians including the country's Interior Minister support medical tests for all asylum seekers who claim to be minors, the German Medical Association says such tests are unethical.
The German Medical Association has rejected a Christian Social Union (CSU) proposal for mandatory medical examinations to determine the age of asylum seekers.
""Ordering such an exam on every refugee would be an invasion of personal well-being,” the association's president Frank Ulrich Montgomery told Süddeutsche Zeitung.
CSU Bundestag (German parliament) members plan to decide during their closed session, which starts this Thursday, whether to enforce medical exams to assess the age of all alleged minor refugees.
This proposal comes after violence in Kandel, Rhineland-Palatinate, in which a 15-year-old Afghani boy - who had come unaccompanied to Germany in 2016 as an asylum seeker - is suspected to have fatally stabbed his 15-year-old girlfriend.
READ ALSO: Teen suspected of fatally stabbing girl was victim's ex-boyfriend: investigator
After the case in Kandel, several Christian Democrats (CDU) and CSU politicians called for the age of refugees to be checked by means of an X-ray of the wrist.
But Montgomery argues that “X-ray without medical indication is an intervention in physical integrity.”
According to rules of radiation protection, age determination is only permissible within a criminal proceeding. In the case of the 15-year-old Afghani suspect, he could now legally undergo an X-ray exam to determine his age.
Genital exams can also be included in age determination procedures, which Montgomery said was “burdened with great uncertainty.”
In 2016, the central ethics commission of the German Medical Association had moreover questioned both the reliability and constitutionality of medical age assessments.
Meanwhile Germany's Interior Minister, Thomas de Maziere, of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Wednesday advocated medical tests to estimate the age of undocumented young asylum seekers, despite objections from health care professionals.
The minister in charge of domestic security, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has thrown his support behind the controversial tests, stating it was ""not too much to ask if they have to actively participate in determining their age"".
He called for rules stating that ""in all cases where no official and genuine document can be produced, the age must be determined by other means, if necessary through a medical examination.""

					08:54 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Merkel finally agrees to 'refugee cap' after tricky summit with Bavarian ally,"Two weeks after winning elections with a reduced majority, Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed on Sunday to limit Germany's refugee intake in a bid to unite her conservative camp ahead of tough coalition talks to form a new government.
Merkel's team huddled with her Bavarian CSU allies led by Horst Seehofer, who has angrily blamed her decision to allow in over one million asylum seekers since 2015 for the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
After 10 hours of closed-door talks, Merkel's CDU and the CSU agreed they would aim to cap refugees coming to Europe's top economy at 200,000 a year, according to a draft paper - a formulation close to a long-time Seehofer demand that Merkel had repeatedly rejected.
The goal of the meeting was to settle bitter squabbles so the estranged conservative sister parties can again present a united front in upcoming coalition talks with two smaller parties - the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning and ecologist Greens.
The CSU's beleaguered Seehofer - who after a vote drubbing faces internal challengers, and state elections next year - had vowed to close his party's exposed ""right flank"" and win back AfD voters, crucially by taking a harder line on refugees and immigration.
In an opening salvo Sunday, the CSU had published a list of demands, including capping refugee numbers, a commitment to a ""healthy patriotism"" and an acknowledgement that ""conservatism is sexy again"".
""We must fight the AfD head-on - and fight to get their voters back,"" said its ten-point list published in mass-circulation Bild am Sonntag.
'Fundamental compromise'
Merkel had long rejected Seehofer's signature demand for an iron-cast ""upper limit"" of 200,000 refugees a year - but late Sunday a deal was shaping up that some commentators dubbed an ""upper limit light"".
After hours of talks to square the circle of their competing positions, ""a fundamental compromise has been reached"", an alliance source told AFP.
Later, as the marathon talks ended, a party spokesman announced that Merkel and Seehofer would explain the agreement in a joint press conference at 1000 GMT Monday.
The draft deal includes a target of limiting the refugee intake at 200,000 a year, but with caveats. It also says that asylum seekers will not be turned back before their cases are assessed, in line with the German constitution.
The 200,000-figure refers to controlled entries, such as through family reunions, and refugees accepted at the EU level or under a deal between the bloc and Turkey.
If there were a repeat of the chaotic mass migration like that from war-torn Syria and other conflict zones seen in 2015, the government would reassess the issue and consult parliament on a new target figure, according to the draft proposal.
Both CDU and CSU say migrant flows must be reduced through fighting traffickers and better guarding the EU's outside borders.
And the parties also plan a broader immigration law aimed at attracting qualified migrants with labour skills sought by German industry - matching a core demand of the FDP.
They also want to renew a push to declare three North African nations ""safe countries of origin"", raising the bar for asylum claims from there - a demand so far blocked by the Greens, who point to human rights abuses in those countries.
Odd bedfellows
The emergence of the anti-immigration AfD, which scored 12.6 percent to enter the opposition benches, has stunned Germany by breaking a long-standing taboo on hard-right parties sitting in the Bundestag.
Its success came at the expense of all the mainstream parties, making it harder for Merkel to form a working majority.
Her only chance now, if she wants to avoid fresh elections that could further boost the AfD, is an alliance with two other parties that make for odd bedfellows, the FDP and Greens.
Such a power pact - dubbed a ""Jamaica coalition"" because the three party colours match those of the Caribbean nation's flag - would be a first at the federal level in Germany.
Tough talks lie ahead as the parties differ on refugees, EU policy and the Greens' core demands, including phasing out coal plants and fossil fuel vehicles.
The Greens' co-leader Cem Ozdemir, voicing some impatience with the divided conservatives, warned that they ""must not block the formation of a government for weeks""."

Following the influx of people who came to Germany seeking asylum in 2015 and 2016, the number of deportations and departures had significantly risen. But now there is a clear decline.
In theory, asylum seekers whose applications are unsuccessful are threatened with deportation. Those faced with deportation have the option to leave voluntarily and receive financial support.
For the past several months, the federal and state governments have been encouraging asylum seekers to go back to their native countries. Coordination centres for repatriations have been set up as well as counselling services, telephone hotlines, an information portal online and increased financial aid for voluntary returnees.
So far this year, some 39 percent of all asylum applications have been turned down. According to the Institute for Employment Research (IAB), there are currently 600,000 people living in Germany who have been granted protection. Two thirds of these have full asylum and a third have a lesser form of asylum known as subsidiary protection.
But the vast majority of those who have their applications rejected stay anyway. At the end of last year some 556,499 people were still living in Germany despite being turned down for asylum. Four out of five of these people had been in the country for at least six years.

The attack will likely make Germans more fearful; a Pew Research Center poll from earlier in July showed that 61 percent of Germans were concerned that refugees would increase the likelihood of terrorism in the country.
But some experts say that the country needs to improve support and education for minors arriving in Germany.
Marianne Burkert-Eulitz, the Green Party's spokesperson for Family, Youths and Children, told Tagesspiegel there were ""substantial shortcomings"" in the care of unaccompanied minors.
Saying that young refugees seek shelter, family and community, she urged that more be done to provide this so that extremists can't take advantage of their exclusion.
She said it was critical for young refugees to receive a legal guardian, residential groups and therapy if they are traumatized.
Burkert-Eulitz added that nation- and Europe-wide databases should do a better job at keeping track of where the unaccompanied minors are.
Björb Eggert, youth spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Berlin, told Tagesspiegel that the state needs to look into innovative ways to spot psychological warning signs in young people as youths are often reluctant to seek help themselves.
So what is the process for caring for refugees who arrive in Germany as unaccompanied minors?

As of January this year, there were at least 60,000 child and teenage refugees in Germany who had arrived without a guardian, according to figures from the Federal Association for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees (BumF). The majority are older teenagers, aged over 16.
In 2015, most of these minors came from Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea, Iraq, and Somalia, with every third application submitted on behalf of someone from Afghanistan.
Arrival of refugee children in Germany

When they first arrive, the minors are looked after by the Youth Welfare Office. The Office provides help including accommodation, which may be with a relative, foster family, youth institution or a 'clearing house' specializing in unaccompanied minors. Within two weeks, they are distributed across the country.
The BumF aims to improve the reception and accommodation of refugee children, as well as their access to health care and education.
The next step is to clarify the applicants residential status, and if their age cannot be determined from documents, physical and/or psychological examinations may be carried out to provide an estimate.
BumF also works to ensure the successful integration of the refugee children in their new society, and says ""many [refugee] adolescents succeed in actively leading a socially committed life and fulfilling their personal dreams and goals"".
German guardians and host families
In response to the influx of refugee children in Berlin, the Caritas Association for Guardianship recently launched an appeal for Berliners to adopt the role of legal guardian for these young refugees, to which around 500 people responded.
Guardians take on tasks including organizing the child's healthcare and education, and the role takes around eight hours per month, according to the Cura Association of Care and Guardianship. The Association offers training and advice for those who take on the role, and volunteers' suitability is assessed before they begin.

The majority of refugee children do not live with their guardians, but in institutions. However, families can also apply to become host or foster families for refugees, by applying to their local Youth Welfare Office.
BumF has said that the role and number of host and foster families varies across the German regions, and stresses that a family environment ""opens up many opportunities"" for refugees, but that high standards of care must always be maintained.
Burkert-Eulitz said that the process of registering refugees and allocating them to accommodation and schooling must be made quicker and more efficient.
Many refugee children missing in Germany
An answer from the Interior Ministry to the German Parliament (Bundestag) revealed that last year 5,835 refugee children were reported as missing, newspapers from the Funke Mediengruppe reported in April.
The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) told The Local at the time that sometimes missing children will turn up again and that the numbers could be distorted if one child is reported as missing in multiple places, or with slightly different personal information. However, in 2015, only one in four missing refugee children was found again.
How great is the risk of radicalization?
Young refugees may suffer from trauma due to experiences in their home country, and must adapt to a new culture and language at a vulnerable age.
If these young refugees slip under the radar, they risk “prostitution, slavery, begging, forced labour, organ removal and sexual abuse”, Ulrike Schwarz, a spokesperson for BumF, told the Berliner Zeitung.
Contact with Islamic extremists is also a potential risk. Back in September 2015, a spokesperson for Bavaria's intelligence service said extremists had approached young unaccompanied refugees near reception centres as well as at Munich's railway station.
Speaking to DPA, the spokesperson said the extremists wanted ""to take advantage of the insecurity and distress of the refugees"".
When police searched the home where the 17-year-old train attacker had been living with a foster family for two weeks, they found a handmade Isis flag as well as two texts, one thought to be a suicide note, which said: “pray for me that I can take vengeance on these unbelievers”.
Isis also released a video purporting to be of the attacker, which police have said they are treating as genuine."

A total of 34,000 refugees have found work in Germany over the past 12 months, the figures released on Monday by the government’s Institute for Labour Research (IAB) showed.
Almost quarter (22 percent) of those who have found work are on temporary contracts.
The numbers are for refugees out of the eight most important countries of origin, including Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea.
“If we manage to get 50 percent of them into work which pays for their lives in five years, that’d certainly be a success,” said Joachim Möller, director of the IAB.
But he cautioned that “it would be an illusion to believe that we will manage to find jobs for a decent proportion of refugees in well-paid industry jobs like car manufacturing.”
Möller added that temporary jobs were important to help refugees get a foot in the door.
“Many companies are sceptical, so temporary work can help them get a feel for someone.”
The refugee influx has also created between 50,000 and 60,000 jobs for Germans, with extra jobs in professions such as teacher and social worker likely to be needed for years to come, according to Möller.
“If you think back to reunification Germany has already overcome very different challenges to the refugee influx.”
Möller says that what effect the refugees will have on the German economy can only be understood in five or six years.
“It probably won’t lead to us making money, but diversity can have positive effects.”
The government assessment was considerably more downbeat than a report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy published last week, which suggested that by the end of 2018, more refugees will be employed than out of work."

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has been struggling to balance its books since the United States announced in January it was cutting its annual funding by $300 million (260 million euros).
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a letter to European Union colleagues that the agency was a ""key factor for stability"" in the Middle East whose breakdown could entail an ""uncontrollable chain reaction"".
Maas did not say how much money Germany would give in addition to 81 million euros it has already provided so far this year, but appealed to the EU to jointly support the agency to make up the deficit.
The foreign ministry confirmed the content of the letter.
UNRWA director Pierre Krahenbuhl said Thursday that the agency needs $200 million to continue its work until the end of this year.
The agency supports some five million registered Palestinian refugees and provides schooling for 526,000 children in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
But UNRWA has warned it currently only has the funds to keep its 711 schools open for the next month.
Jordan's foreign minister said Thursday that his country would host a fundraiser at the United Nations headquarters in New York on September 27 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly to keep the agency afloat."

					14:42 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Germany stops sending refugees to Hungary due to poor treatment,"Germany said Tuesday it is refraining from transferring asylum seekers to Hungary under EU rules until Budapest gives assurances that the migrants would not be systematically detained.
Under the so-called Dublin rules, asylum seekers are meant to be sent back to the first European country they registered in.
But the United Nations and rights groups have urged EU nations to suspend transfers to Hungary after Budapest introduced a law in March to detain all asylum seekers.
Germany's interior ministry said in a directive to the migration office that ""in cases of Dublin transfers to Hungary, an assurance must be sought ensuring that the transferred person would be accommodated in accordance with EU norms"".
""Without such a reassurance from the Hungarian authorities, the transfer should not take place,"" the ministry added, confirming a report published in German regional media group Funke.
Germany had initially waived Dublin rules for Syrian refugees at the height of the migrant influx in 2015.
But after the arrival of around one million people, public misgivings grew, forcing Chancellor Angela Merkel to take steps to limit the arrivals.
Last year, the figure dropped sharply to 280,000, largely due to the closure of the Balkan overland route and a fragile EU-Turkey deal to limit the mass influx.
Germany, along with other EU nations, also began sending back asylum seekers to Greece from mid-March as they assessed that conditions there have improved.
But concerns then turned to the situation in Hungary, after its parliament on March 7 approved plans to confine asylum seekers in camps.
Official figures show that Germany sent back 11,998 asylum seekers to their first port of call in the EU last year, including 294 who were returned to Hungary."

					08:41 CET+01:00				",AFP,Syrian refugee teacher starts job at German school,"Working at a German school is not just about reading and writing, maths and singing songs, says newly minted Syrian assistant teacher Hend al-Khabbaz.
She was surprised to discover there is also a mountain of paperwork and administrative tasks to perform.
The school ""is better for the children, but it's a lot of work for the teachers,"" the 35-year-old says with a laugh, speaking in German which she has learnt since fleeing her war-torn homeland less than three years ago.
Khabbaz's new workplace is the Sigmund Jähn primary school in Fürstenwalde, a town of drab pre-fabricated housing blocks in Germany's formerly communist east, 60 kilometres from Berlin.
That's around 3,500 kilometres from the home she left in Homs, Syria, where she taught English before boarding an overcrowded boat for her escape to Europe.
After a gruelling trek along the Balkans route, she requested asylum in Germany in September 2015, at the peak of a mass influx that has since brought more than a million refugees and migrants.
While Germany has struggled to integrate many of the newcomers, Khabbaz got a lucky break and through her hard work now has a full-time job in her profession.
She is one of the first graduates of Potsdam University's pioneering Refugee Teachers Programme, which readies foreign teachers to enter the German school system.
Of the initial 700 applicants in 2016, 85 percent were Syrians.
""These are people who have had a good university education,"" says Miriam Vock, the professor who initiated the programme.
""We want to give them the chance to be able to work again here.""
In the corridors of the Fürstenwalde school, a bell cuts through the hubbub of recess and signals the return to class.
Among the children flocking to their desks in a classroom with paper butterflies on the green walls are four Syrian children -- Yasmine, Zaid and two boys named Mohamed.
Their colourful pencil cases in front of them, the pupils, aged nine to 11, listen intently to the lesson.
""What is this man doing?"" asks a teaching assistant at a cinema workshop as the class watches a video.
Mohamed, wearing sweatpants, raises his hand and says eagerly in his newly-acquired language: ""He is opening the door.""
Standing beside the Syrian pupils is Khabbaz, ready to help out in those moments when the four youngsters need some extra help.
Yasmine, with long brown braids that fall down her back, turns to the young woman and whispers a question in Arabic.
""There are words they don't understand yet, or sometimes the teacher speaks too quickly,"" says Khabbaz.
School principal Ines Tesch explains that the refugee children ""still struggle with the specialised language of biology or physics"".
""When there's no other way, the children speak their mother tongue,"" says Tesch.
It means precious support for the children who, aside from having to find their way in an unknown country, carry the memories of war, upheaval and exodus.
The Sigmund Jähn School, named after the first East German cosmonaut in space, is currently hosting 92 refugee children, including 45 Syrians, among its total of 350 pupils.
Tesch says that Khabbaz ""has allowed us to build bridges"" with foreign-born parents who are often overwhelmed by the demands of a German bureaucracy ever hungry for official stamps and documents.
Khabbaz says the biggest obstacle to resuming her profession was learning the new language, which made up the bulk of the Potsdam training course.
""It's very demanding because the participants have to acquire the level of German that is essential for teaching,"" says programme founder Vock.
It is the main reason that out of the first batch of 26 graduates in 2017, only 12 have so far joined a school. The others will have to sit their German exams again.
Still, the programme has been hailed a success, and other German universities are now following suit, at a time when some rural regions suffer a critical lack of teachers.
""It is clear that in the end they will all find a job in a school,"" says Vock.
However, the hurdles are higher for those who want to obtain the privileged status of civil servant, because ""most of them are only licensed to teach one subject,"" Vock adds.
""In Germany you need a master's degree and two teaching subjects.""
For now, Khabbaz is happy to be building a new life in the town where the Sputnik bakery and Yuri Gagarin Street, named after a Russian cosmonaut, recall the Cold War past.
Although the region has seen an upsurge in anti-foreigner sentiment since the mass migrant influx, Khabbaz says she has been spared open discrimination and racism.
""No-one has ever dared to say a thing about Ms al-Khabbaz,"" says Tesch, the energetic school principal.
""But I know I would probably have problems with some parents if she wore a Muslim face veil.""

					10:23 CEST+02:00				", The Local,String of knife attacks further fuels debate over refugees and violence,"A spate of bloody knife attacks in recent weeks has led to concerns about a rise in knife crime. The fact that teenage refugees have often been the culprits has also fired up right-wing critics of the government.
On Tuesday morning a 24-year-old woman's life still hung in the balance after she was stabbed on Saturday in the town of Burgwedel in Lower Saxony. After undergoing an emergency operation she was placed in an artificial coma.
The woman and her boyfriend had reportedly become involved in an argument with a group of three teenagers from Syria. When the situation turned aggressive, the woman attempted to intervene, but one of the teenagers pulled out a knife and stabbed her.
On the same day in Bochum a 15-year-old schoolboy was stabbed during a fight involving around 20 teenagers. A 16-year-old from Syria was arrested over the attack. The victim was treated in hospital but his situation is not life threatening.
A day earlier, at Wiesbaden central station an argument escalated between two groups of men. One of them pulled a knife and left three others injured. The suspected culprit is from Afghanistan.
The series of bloody incidents over the weekend come in the wake of two murderous stabbings by refugees in recent months, at least one of which appears to have been motivated by jealousy.
In Flensburg an Afghan teenager was arrested early this month on suspicion of stabbing a girl a year his junior to death. The teenager was said to have often visited his victim before the murder. That crime followed another brutal murder in December in the town of Kandel in Rhineland Palatinate where a 15-year-old girl was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, also an asylum seeker from Afghanistan.
Not all the suspects in the recent spate of stabbings have been refugees. In Hanover over the weekend a group of three masked individuals attacked a 17-year-old, stabbing him in the leg after he had refused to hand over his mobile telephone. The trio reportedly spoke accentless German. In Berlin over the weekend at a nightclub, an Iraqi man was furthermore stabbed by a German following an argument.
At least seven knife attacks were recorded last weekend alone.
And in Berlin early this month a teenage German boy was arrested on suspicion of murdering a 14-year-old girl. She was found dead in her apartment with several stab wounds.
Nonetheless, the prevalence of asylum seekers as suspects in these crimes has given voice to those who say that the government's liberal refugee policies have made the country less safe.
“The knives are growing longer, the attackers are ever younger. The number of knife attacks by asylum seekers grows constantly,” Alice Weidel, co-parliamentary leader of the Alternative for Germany, wrote on Facebook on Monday.
“I call on Interior minister Horst Seehofer to immediately take the suspects into detention pending deportation and then to eject them from the country,” she said. “It needs to be clear that the state is using all its power to protect its citizens.”
The German government in September 2015 opened its borders to refugees from Syria, leading to mass arrivals of asylum seekers over several months. Between 2015 and the middle of 2017, over 1.3 million asylum seekers arrived in the country.
With police statistics showing that refugees and asylum seekers are significantly over-represented in violent crime statistics, the political mood has been raw for some time.
In 2016, irregular migrants (a category including refugees, asylum seekers and people awaiting deportation) were suspects in some 12 percent of homicide cases, despite making up less than two percent of the population.
But there are currently no comprehensive statistics on knife crime, making it difficult to make accurate statements about the severity of the increase in stabbings. Police unions are now calling for knife crime to be published in nationwide statistics.
Dietmar Schilff, a spokesman for the German Police Union, told DPA on Tuesday that more and more teenagers were carrying knives around with them.
“We are witnessing a dangerous trend - within a split second a life-threatening situation can develop,” he said.
“We need to know where such attacks are happening most regularly and who is carrying them out, so that we can react better,” he added.

					09:01 CET+01:00				",Jörg Luyken,Opinion: In 2016 Germany woke up to the hard reality of the refugee influx,"In 2015 hundreds of thousands of Germans gave their time, money and possessions to help people fleeing war. This year they were shaken by the dark side of the refugee influx, argues Jörg Luyken.
They called it the summer fairy tale.
As tens of thousands of refugees poured over the border every day in September 2015, Germany felt its most glorious moment of redemption in the eyes of the world since 1945.
At Munich's main train station, volunteers waited to help Syrian families who had fled the horrors of Aleppo.
Merkel and her cabinet posed for selfies with refugees and the media joyously republished them.
No one likes being the bad guy. And Germany had spent most of the summer being just that, demanding that impoverished Greece start paying up its debts to the rest of the Eurozone.
Now Germany was there for the downtrodden while the rest of the world looked on apathetically.
But behind the headlines the public was always more dubious. Polling showed increased disquiet through the autumn, as refugee arrivals grew and grew.
The turn of the year was the day which flicked the switch on the public mood, though.
Sexual assaults in Cologne, Hamburg and other cities at New Year went unreported at first, as panicked state authorities did not know how to handle mounting evidence they were carried out by North African migrants.
But as news of the assaults emerged via social media this mishandling of the information only added to the scandal. The country had been reassured that asylum seekers, grateful for the protection, would be obedient to German law.
Now crimes were emerging on a scale that was completely unheard of in Germany, and state authorities and the media, seemed to be covering them up.
The government warned people not to cast blame on all refugees, while announcing tougher asylum laws that resulted in thousands of Syrians being split from their families for years.
As the months ticked by stories about sexual harassment and assault kept making headlines.
A report that 30 asylum seekers harassed two teenage girls in Kiel, was followed by an outdoor festival in Hesse, where women reported being encircled and groped by young ""Asian looking"" men.
In the last few weeks of the year asylum seekers were again repeatedly linked to violent sexual assault in news reports.
In Freiburg a young Afghan man was arrested on a rape-murder charge in November. Days later in Bochum an Iraqi man was arrested on suspicion of the rape and attempted rape of two Chinese students.
This month in Hamburg a Moroccan who should have already been deported was arrested on suspicion of raping a woman in a club toilet. In Meinigen, an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested for the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
In Berlin, the trial of a Pakistani asylum seeker started last week. He is accused of one count of rape and five counts of sexual assault.
The government's response has been to say that rape existed in Germany before refugees arrived. The German public responded by buying pepper spray, blank-shooting guns and anti-rape alarms.
The other thread weaving its way through the news narrative in 2016 was terrorism, or its potential. And again this started on the very first day of the year.
Before news of sexual assaults in Cologne broke, the big story of January 1st was that police had shut down New Year celebrations in central Munich on security fears. But whether there was a substantial threat has never been resolved.
By February 4th the first terror arrests had been made. Police swooped on a 35-year-old Algerian living in a refugee centre in North Rhine-Westphalia. Prosecutors described him as the ringleader of a plot to attack Berlin.
More arrests took place. More worrying claims of brutal attack plots.
Random acts of violence by psychologically disturbed individuals immediately led to rumours swirling on social media of terrorist motives.
Then on July 18th an Afghan teenager entered a regional train in Bavaria wielding an axe and began attacking passengers. He brutalized a family of Chinese holidaymakers before making off into the night and dying in police gunfire.
Police soon found an Isis flag in his home, and the terror group followed up by publishing a video of the young asylum seeker threatening unbelievers.
Six days later in nearby Ansbach a Syrian man attempted to enter a music festival carrying a rucksack packed with explosives.
But, at the sight of security guards he lost his nerve and blew it up next to a cafe. He was the only fatality, but a newspaper report suggested he used the same highly explosive material as that used by bombers in Brussels a few months earlier.
Again Isis released a video which linked him to the attack. The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that an Isis operative had guided him throughout his failed terror attempt.
August and September were quiet. But it wouldn't last. October saw the first full scale manhunt of the year, as a Syrian refugee suspected of planning an Isis bomb plot escaped the clutches of police.
He was eventually grabbed by some countrymen, but was able to commit suicide in jail, to the outrage of Germany's justice officials.
Isis had managed to save their most deadly terrorist for last, though.
The attack on a Berlin Christmas market on December 19th, almost certainly carried out by a radicalized Tunisian man who arrived in Germany as a asylum seeker in 2015, killed 12 people and injured dozens more.
After four tense days with the attacker on the run and armed, he was finally killed in Italy.
Merkel's response has been to say that terrorism isn't a new phenomenon. Her government has told people to carry on with their every day lives, otherwise the terrorists will win.
The response of the German public has been to start avoiding big crowds and to start voting for the far-right Alternative for Germany."

					15:54 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Growing number of Syrian refugees in Germany making 'reverse escape' to Turkey,"Syrians with a German residence permit are increasingly traveling to Turkey, often with the help of smugglers, an investigative report from German broadcaster NDR reveals.
The main reason for many refugees is to reunite with their families. As the refugees don’t receive visas to travel to Turkey, they often take risky routes back into the country, the report from the program “Panorama” explained.
Using social media outlets such as Facebook, the refugees post on several online groups to gain insights into the “reverse escape” into Turkey, in which they also share information about the prices of smugglers. A journey over the Evros, the river which divides Greece and Turkey, costs about €200, the Panorama report revealed.
The reporters conducted their research along the Turkish-Greek border, interviewing several smugglers themselves. One confirmed that he brings up to 50 people, mostly Syrians who hold a German residence permit, into Turkey from Greece on a daily basis. Another smuggler said he brings more refugees into Turkey than vice-versa.
""The fact that refugees are using the same route to go to Turkey which they originally used to get to Germany is a paradox,” Dominik Bartsch, the German ambassador to the UN Refugee Commission, told Panorama.
Refugees with a German residence permit can legally travel into Greece, but from there are unable to travel further into Turkey without a visa.
Around 4,000 Syrian refugees have been reported as missing, according to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), among which could include those travelling into Turkey, reported Panorama. However this number could be much higher, as it is not recorded if a person were to travel to a fellow European Union country such as Greece.
Yet Horst Seehofer, Germany's conservative Interior Minister, told the program it is not necessary for Germany to offer a legal way for refugees to enter Turkey again. “We are a free country, thank God,” he told the program. “Should we now control exits at the borders?”
Seehofer is behind a draft law which would restrict refugee family reunifications, allowing only unmarried minor children, spouses and parents of minors already in Germany to enter the country. A more controversial passage of the draft law furthermore states that family reunifications could be denied for people who are “dependent on welfare payments.""
Green Party refugee spokesperson Luise Amtsberg criticized the proposed legislation, telling Panorama that the number of refugees heading back to Turkey is likely to increase if it passes.
""We have an agreement with Turkey, which says that we take in refugees to relieve Turkey,” said Amtsberg. “Yet on the other side, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection from Germany come back to Turkey be with their families, that's absurd."""

					10:18 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Merkel accused of ignoring warnings of 'irregularities' at refugee authority,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel came under pressure Sunday over a brewing scandal surrounding the office charged with processing more than a million asylum seekers who have arrived in the country since 2015.
The affair stems from allegations that an employee of the branch office of the German migration agency (BAMF) in the city of Bremen may have granted asylum to 1,200 migrants in exchange for money or gifts in kind.
Investigators opened a probe in April into ""organised abuse of the asylum procedure"" as well as for ""corruption or bribery"" and Merkel's government has pledged a thorough inquiry.
The employee insists she was simply overwhelmed by the large number of cases landing on her desk with Germany having received than a million asylum seekers since 2015.
However, the former head of BAMF, Frank-Juergen Weise, added fuel to the political fire when he accused Merkel of knowing about wider problems at the agency since at least last year and neglecting to deal with them.
""The failure lies in the inaction (of the government) when the challenges that Germany would face with the arrival of the refugees became clear,"" Weise told news weekly Der Spiegel.
""The crisis could have been prevented,"" added Weise, who said he personally informed Merkel on two occasions of irregularities in 2017 without concrete action being taken.
Asked for comment, a government spokesman said only that ""the chancellor remained in contact with Mr Weise from the time he became head of the BAMF until the end of his tenure"".
Weise led the BAMF from late 2015 until the end of 2016 and in late 2017 published a final report about his term at the agency.
Doubts about Germany's ability to grapple with the arrival of around 1.2 million asylum seekers over the last three years have eroded political support for Merkel, who is now in her fourth term as German chancellor.
The work of the BAMF, which answers to the interior ministry, has come in for particularly intense criticism for chaotic handling of the asylum process.
The mass influx in 2015-2016 put the service under intense pressure, forcing it to more than double its staff to 7,300 from 3,000.
Merkel's junior partner in her ""grand coalition"" government, the Social Democrats (SPD), on Sunday demanded ""explanations"" from her.
""This is quite simply the chancellor's failure,"" SPD vice chairman Ralf Stegner told Berlin's daily Tagesspiegel.
""You can't say 'we can do it' (Merkel's slogan during the refugee influx) and then sit with your arms crossed when the agency responsible loses control due to a lack of resources,"" he added.

Twenty-six-year-old Suliman al-S. was arrested in January 2016, becoming the first asylum seeker in Germany to face charges over alleged war crimes committed in Syria.
The court in the southwestern city of Stuttgart found that while the suspect did not take part in the 2013 abduction of a Canadian UN observer, he aided and abetted the kidnappers by acting as a guard.
The peacekeeper with the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), who was stationed in the Golan Heights but abducted in Damascus, managed to free himself after eight months in captivity.
Prosecutors had sought a seven-year sentence for Suliman al-S., who arrived in Germany in 2014.
The judges said they had not seen conclusive proof that the suspect belonged to a branch of the Al-Nusra Front jihadist group, as alleged by the prosecution.
The peacekeeper's identity was never revealed by German prosecutors, but the UN said in 2013 that Carl Campeau, a Canadian legal advisor, was abducted on February 17 as he drove through a Damascus suburb.
He was freed in October, without a ransom being paid, according to the UN.
German federal prosecutors have opened over a dozen investigations concerning alleged war crimes in Syria or Iraq, alongside dozens of cases of suspected membership in jihadist groups.
The investigations have gained momentum with the arrival of more than one million asylum seekers since 2015, including hundreds of thousands from Syria and Iraq.
In July 2016, in the first such conviction, a German jihadist was sentenced to two years in prison on war crimes charges after posing for pictures in Syria with the severed and impaled heads of two government soldiers."

					06:58 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,Cologne Coexistence: Where the AfD and a refugee agency share an office space,"Cologne’s AfD office shares a kitchen and sanitation facilities with a refugee coordination office. Can this work out, or it is the material of the sitcom? Both parties have a very clear opinion about it.
Haus Neuerburg is a beautiful building, an officially listed monument built almost 100 years ago by a cigarette manufacturer and the Consul General of Greece.
Nevertheless, Hans-Jürgen Oster, head of the municipal refugee agency, had certain reservations when he moved in at the beginning of 2016 with his newly founded department.
The offices of the Cologne AfD parliamentary group are located right next to the rooms he found space in, after his offices outgrew their former location in the city's Rathaus, or town hall.
“This is a group and an office which we would normally not house next to each other,” says Oster cautiously. But then he said resolutely, “Gucken wir uns das doch mal an,” or “Well, we might as well see.”
The AfD does not have as large of a presence in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as elsewhere in Germany, but received 7.2 percent of the vote in state elections in 2017, enough to comfortably put them into the parliament.
The right-wing group encompasses a smorgasbord of issues from standing against a ban on diesel cars to cutting back on immigration: in the past month, the AfD Cologne has tweeted about crimes around the country, emphasizing the migration background of the perpetrators.
A sitcom in the making?
Stepping into Haus Neuerburg, there are several people coming and going throughout the busy building. That’s owed on one hand to the building being the location registrar’s office and on the other to the refugee office.
Everywhere - be it in the foyer, corridors and elevator - you meet people who don’t appear as though their families had been living in the Rhineland for generations.

Some of the greatest legendary Kölner themselves have refugee roots. Take, for example, prolific actor and theatre director Willy Millowitsch (1909-1999) whose family came originally from the Balkans.
The third floor: The sign says: ""Alternative for Germany. Group in the Council of the City of Cologne. Room 319, 320"". And right underneath: ""Refugee Coordination Unit. Room 322 to 326"".
A photo of a similar sign outside at the entrance was recently tweeted by TV author Tommi Schmitt. His comment: ""I want 1 sitcom about this building.""
Ich möchte 1 Sitcom über dieses Haus. pic.twitter.com/qnETJvl3lH

There are some elements with situation comedy potential: The AfD politicians and the refugee coordinators share a kitchenette ""and the sanitary facilities"", as Oster puts it.
In retrospect, he doesn't find the set-up so bad at all: at least the two groups can learn from each other and gather information from each other. ""A colleague once said: ""The city of Cologne must have an educational mission.""
The ‘odd couple’ neighbours don’t seem to mind the other’s presence. Even if the AfD people would have to go past posters, which for example advertise volunteer refugee helpers, they would have never complained.
Knocking down the truth
Is that really true? After an energetic knock on one of the AfD doors faction speaker Mattias Büschges answers energetically. ""Yes, please!"" he says, his voice heightening in an inviting tone.
He does not understand at all what should be so special about coexistence. ""That's no problem at all,"" he assures. ""We even work together with our colleagues. If we have questions, then we talk.”
The Cologne AfD confirmed their desire for coexistence on Twitter, quoting Büschges that they feel ""quite comfortable and don't want to move away from here.""

					15:53 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,Why refugees are commiting far less crime,"A report this week showed that the number of crimes committed by refugees and undocumented immigrants dropped nearly 20 percent in just three months. The Local looks into why.
Since numerous women reported being sexually assaulted by non-German men on New Year's Eve, the topic of crime by refugees has become a heated one in Germany, oscillating between out-right racism and cautious questioning of different cultures.
In the months following, Chancellor Angela Merkel backed legal reforms to make it easier to deport migrants who commit crimes, stories of refugees committing crimes have drawn more attention and scrutiny, and some have speculated about whether bringing in roughly one million refugees would lead to more crime.
So the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) decided to bring some facts into the precarious discussion about migrant crime rates.
“The debate has become has become very emotional. Some say that refugees commit all of the crimes, some say refugees are not committing very many crimes,” a spokeswoman from the Interior Ministry told The Local.
“But the truth lies somewhere in the middle. It is not black and white.”
The results of the BKA report may have surprised some: crimes committed by refugees and undocumented immigrants actually fell by 18 percent between January and March.
But what could account for the sharp drop-off?
Close living quarters create tensions
Experts are cautious to jump to conclusions. This was, after all, the first report of its kind to solely focus on the increase in immigration and its impacts on crime. The interior ministry said it's too early to call a trend, and the rates could change when they conduct a new report for April to June.
Still, one main reason for the drop in crime given was the changes in living conditions for refugees.
“One factor could be that we had many people living in large shelters where they were in very close quarters, and therefore it was easier for money to go missing, for wallets to go missing, for fights to start,” the interior ministry spokeswoman told The Local.
The most prevalent crimes by refugees and undocumented immigrants in the report were theft, property crimes and committing bodily harm.
“Many people have now been brought into houses to live and there are not as many big facilities. But it is also within three months, and that is a very short amount of time to analyze.”
An example of the adverse consequences of housing diverse groups all together in make-shift accommodation was seen this week when police say several refugees started a fire on a 5,000 square-metre building where they lived with 280 others.

Prosecutors say the men seem to have been upset over disputed meal times during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
“You have many different people from many different countries,” said chairman of the The German Police Union (DPolG), Rainer Wendt.
“We saw this in Düsseldorf, and it is of course fundamentally better to bring people into their own housing, albeit not for certain people who are guaranteed to be sent back,” he told The Local.
Deportations and a slowing down of the number of people arriving in Germany may also be factors in the crime rate decreasing, according to the interior ministry source.
The closure of borders by Balkan countries through which many refugees once travelled up north has greatly hindered people's ability to reach Germany. More than 90,000 people were registered as entering Germany in January, compared to about 16,000 in May.
“When there are more people, there are more crimes, in any kind of figures,” the interior ministry spokeswoman said. “But it is still too early to know all the factors.”
Crime rates among groups vary greatly
Another finding of the report was that refugees most likely to be granted asylum and stay - those coming from war-torn regions of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - commit a disproportionately lower amount of crimes.
On the other hand, the groups committing a disproportionately high amount of crimes came from countries generally deemed “safe” and are therefore less likely to stay in Germany: Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Serbia, Georgia and Algeria.
Wendt said that after someone arrives and are told they won't be able to live in Germany long-term, they may be more tempted by crime.
“They come here and they wait and then are told they have no chance of staying here, but then must wait through processing,” he said. “Most are sent back. Therefore they have nothing to lose.”
Wendt said that groups from Georgia often come, knowing they won't be able to stay, but to commit theft and burglaries while here.
People from North African countries might be more likely to steal from tourists, if they learned this in the many travel hotspots in their countries, he added.
But Germany has recently put in place stricter rules that may see groups more quickly deported based on where they come from. The German parliament last month voted to block more asylum claims from North Africa, classifying Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as safe countries. Germany had previously added Serbia, Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro to this list to more quickly deport people.
‘Saying either refugees or Germans are less criminal is stupid'
After the release of the report, an interior ministry spokesperson was quoted in German media as saying that “immigrants are not more criminal than Germans”.
But the interior ministry has since told The Local that this statement was taken out of context because in fact, the ministry says “the world is too differentiated to make black-and-white statements”.
Wendt from the police union agreed.
“The statement comparing Germans and immigrants is stupid,” Wendt said. “You cannot make a blanket statement about refugees, who are many people coming from many different countries.
“There are people who never read the news and only look at Facebook, where they only get the impression that all crimes are committed by refugees… but that of course is not statistically true.
“It's always false to say either way who is more criminal.”"

					10:39 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Report: Refugees in Germany are often overqualified,"Refugees in Germany are often overqualified for their jobs, more so even than those living in other EU countries, according to a new report.
Some 71 percent of refugees in Germany are overqualified for their work, compared to an EU average of 60 percent, according to a working paper released on Wednesday by the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The figures were based on comparing the job requirements for refugees’ occupations to their actual qualifications. But when refugee workers were asked personally whether they felt they were overqualified, 54 percent in Germany said yes, compared to 57 percent EU-wide.
Refugees are also more overqualified than other groups of immigrants in Germany: 38 percent of non-EU born employees work in jobs that are below their level of qualifications, compared to 30 percent EU-wide.
And there’s an even starker contrast when looking at the native German population: 16 percent of locals in Germany are overqualified for their jobs, while the EU average is 21 percent.
The OECD used data from 2014, before Germany saw a huge uptick in asylum seekers in 2015.
While refugees in Germany might be overqualified, the report praised Germany for being on the right track of integrating refugees into the job market.
“The refugee crisis is an opportunity to significantly improve the system for integration,” said OECD job market expert Thomas Liebig.
The report also looked at refugees’ language skills, which it noted are important for integration and the job market. Across Europe, less than half had advanced knowledge of the local language, compared to two-thirds of other immigrant groups.
In Germany, only 9 percent of refugees who had lived in the country for up to ten years had an advanced level of German. But this is hard to compare to countries like Spain where most of the refugees come from Latin America and the percentage there was 98 percent who had advanced Spanish.
Still, over time refugees in Germany do seem to take on the language: about half of all refugees who had lived in Germany longer than ten years had advanced German skills.
The situation for female refugees in Germany can be more difficult: their employment rate is 45 percent on average, which is 17 percentage points below men.
But at the same time, of refugee women who came to Germany between 1999 and 2014, every fourth woman had some form of post-secondary education, such as university - this was four percentage points higher than men.
Still, about half of these women had low-level education, which was higher than the amount of men with this level.
The report also noted the importance of gaining citizenship for integration. Germany was behind the rest of the EU in this area, making it the “only major exception” among the countries accepting the most refugees.
On average across the EU, 61 percent of people who had arrived as refugees became citizens after ten years. But in Germany, this percentage was 40 percent."

The group of six, comprised of four members from Germany's national parliament and two state lawmakers, arrived in Damascus on Monday for talks with pro-regime officials and a tour they say is aimed at getting a real idea of the situation on the ground.
""Since the German media's reporting does not offer a trustworthy way of assessing the actual situation in Syria, the goal of the trip is to get an understanding of the humanitarian situation on the ground and the rebuilding efforts in the areas liberated from terrorists,"" they wrote in a statement.
The visitors said they were ""surprised"" by the ""normalcy seen on the streets of Damascus"".
""Women without headscarves are free to move around the strikingly clean streets of the metropolis,"" they said.
The group is being led by Christian Blex, a member of North Rhine-Westphalia's regional parliament, who posted pictures on Facebook of his Monday meeting with Syria's pro-regime Grand Mufti Ahmed Badreddin Hassoun.
The top Sunni cleric ""calls all Syrian refugees to return home"", according to Blex.
Hassoun often appears alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for religious occasions and has in the past warned against Western interference in his country, threatening terror attacks in Europe.
The German group also met with ""representatives from the Syrian parliament"", Blex wrote, who posted a string of pictures of Damascus street scenes, including one from his hotel room showing a pool view.
""You hardly see any military. There's advertising for mobile phones and TVs. Normal daily life,"" Blex added.
Ahead of the trip, Blex said in an interview with the far-right Compact magazine that the delegation would be open to meeting with Assad himself.
The anti-Islam, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time last year, capitalising on anger over an influx of more than a million asylum seekers in Germany since 2015.
As one of its first acts in parliament, the party proposed striking a deal with Assad to repatriate Syrian refugees, who make up the largest number of newcomers in Germany. The motion was rejected.
More than 340,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in Syria since the civil war started in 2011."

In the past twelve months there has been such a massive influx of children that ""we cannot fulfil the legal entitlement to a kindergarten place or compulsory education,"" said Krüger.

					15:33 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,"German men selling fatherhood to refugee women for cash, say prosecutors","Prosecutors allege that men in Berlin are falsely claiming to be the fathers of refugee children, allowing the mothers to stay in the country in exchange for money.
In Germany it is legally possible for men to claim fatherhood of a child, even if they are not the biological father. But Berlin prosecutors said on Tuesday that the system is being abused by female refugees and German men.
The pregnant women pay German men to claim fatherhood of their child, meaning the child automatically has a right to German citizenship and the woman obtains a right to stay in the country, prosecutors allege.
“We are talking about a large number of cases which we come across every month,” said Berlin prosecutor Martin Steltner. “In some cases we have people who have claimed fatherhood for over ten babies.”
According to broadcaster rbb, up to 700 fake fatherhood recognitions have been sold to women over the last few months in Berlin. The women pay several thousand euros for the recognition. On the other hand, the mainly unemployed men pay nothing to the women for the care of the children, with the state instead being responsible for welfare payments.
In one case reported on by rbb, 70 pregnant Vietnamese women lived in one Berlin house linked to the deceit. But the transactions are reportedly taking place across the country, with many women also coming from Africa and eastern Europe.
“The estimated number of unknown cases is high,” said Ole Schröder, undersecretary in the Interior Ministry.
But the prosecutors currently have few legal options at their disposal to tackle the deceit, as no law is being broken. Current law states that whoever recognizes fatherhood of a child is the father, regardless of whether this is biologically true or not.
“For this reason, we don’t have the legally means to investigate these cases,” said Steltner.
The laws are currently being changed to close the loophole."

					09:32 CEST+02:00				",AFP/DPA/The Local,Security guards in Berlin are pushing refugees into prostitution: media report,"Employees at security companies in Berlin are believed to have persuaded refugees into prostitution in refugee homes, according to a media report broadcast on Tuesday.
In the report, aired by broadcaster ZDF's investigative programme called “Frontal 21,” social workers, insiders at security companies and refugees attest to the prostitution, adding that minors are also involved.
One security officer who is responsible for several shelters said that a network of pimps exists in Berlin's refugee homes and often security guards are the ones who establish initial contact with refugees.
Sex with male refugees is particularly in demand, according to the employee. ""From upwards of 16 years of age, the younger the more expensive,"" he said.
A security guard at one refugee centre admitted to ZDF that he earns €20 for every connection he sets up.
One 20-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan, whose application had been rejected, said in the programme that after a male security guard asked him whether he wanted to do business, he said: ""for sex with a woman you get €30, maybe even €40"".
The Afghan told ZDF he had to earn money to survive. ""I'm ashamed of what I do,” he said.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the ""very, very serious"" accusations of procurement needed to be investigated.
""We have to take this very seriously because it is totally unacceptable to exploit the material hardships that many refugees and migrants are in,"" he told reporters at a regular press briefing.
""It would be morally reprehensible if they were forced into prostitution.""
But Berlin authorities have not yet received any indications of organized prostitution in the capital's refugee shelters.
Elke Breitenbach, a senator for social affairs and integration in the capital city, said that despite “no concrete indications” of cases of organized prostitution in refugee shelters, she demanded that the police and public prosecutor's office follow up on the claims.
A spokeswoman from the senate department for integration, labour and social affairs added that due to these suspicions, the institution's responsible body, refugee home managements, security services, volunteers and representatives of the State Office for Refugee Affairs (LaGeSo) sought a joint discussion.
But social workers in one of the shelters where prostitution is suspected, in the former Wilmersdorf town hall, are trained to detect signs of abuse or prostitution, she said.
Nevertheless, flyers by Berlin aid associations will be distributed and training courses are planned for employees in order to be able to detect such dangers more effectively, the spokeswoman added."

					14:57 CEST+02:00				",Emma Anderson ,"A tour of Berlin, through the eyes of refugees","A tour group started by a British immigrant is giving Syrian refugees the chance to connect their new home to the one they left behind.
A tour through central Berlin on a recent, rainy Saturday afternoon guided its participants through some of Berlin's most typical attractions: Checkpoint Charlie, Gendarmenmarkt, the shopping district around Friedrichstrasse.
But the stories told throughout were quite different than other tourist excursions. Along with Berlin's Cold War history and Nazi past, the tour guides spoke of Syria's own secret police, government repression, and natives fleeing for safer destinations - drawing parallels between the two nations.
The Refugee Voices Tours were launched less than a year ago by British transplant Lorna Cannon in the German capital, and have since expanded into Copenhagen and soon Paris. Herself a tour guide, Cannon told The Local that she had noticed that a lot of tourists in the city were asking about the situation with refugees in the country because of all the media coverage.
“I thought ‘this isn't my story to tell. People should hear these stories',” Cannon explains.
So she began to organize the tours with Syrian friends she already knew from working with refugees, and together they decided to link the similarities between German history and Syria's ongoing civil war.
For example, the tour connects the communist East German government's repression of the June 17th 1953 uprising during the Cold War to the 1982 Hama massacre. Both events involved the respective governments using military force to quash civilian revolts.
Like in Hama, the exact number of people killed in East Berlin that June day is not known, some calculating several hundred deaths. Estimates for the number of people killed in Hama during the anti-government uprising meanwhile range in the thousands.
And in both cases, the governments downplayed or distorted what actually happened, East Germany blaming it on Western forces seeking to disrupt national stability, and the Syrian government often calling the massacre the “accidents of Hama”, tour guide Eyas Adi says.
“I think history is like a loop: what happened in Germany is happening in other countries,” observes Berliner Andreas along the tour route.
Another stop on the tour reveals the perhaps little known connection between Nazi Germany and Syria. An investigation by a French magazine earlier this year began to unravel the fate of Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner, who ended up in Syria after the Second World War. He is believed to have become an advisor to Syrian secret police, reportedly passing on Nazi interrogation methods.
""He helped teach Syrians about torture,"" Adi says.
The tour also uses Checkpoint Charlie to represent the German capital's own internal division during the Cold War, until the country was ultimately reunified amid thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West.
“People escaping from East to West were similar to Syrian refugees now,” Adi says. “They wanted to have more opportunities for their children in a more free and stable country.”
The final stop on the tour is Gendarmenmarkt, a square featuring twin churches dating back to the early 1700s. One was built for the French Huguenot refugees who settled in the city due to persecution in France, and the other is a German Lutheran church.
“The message is that people can live together and integrate, even if they come from different religions or cultures,” Adi explains.
For some taking the tour, it's the first time to truly put real faces to the news they see so often - and to understand how they ended up in Berlin.
“I wanted to hear from a Syrian person their point of view, besides just what the media says,” Brazilian Beatriz Oberlaender, who recently moved to Berlin herself, tells The Local.
Adi came to Germany about a year ago after he said he tried to stay in Damascus for as long as possible. A medical student there, he had worked in social and psychological services with victims of the conflict. But when he could no longer avoid serving his legally obligated military service for a regime he criticizes, Adi decided to leave, and was granted asylum last November.
“If the situation were better, I think I would go back,” he says.
For the guides, the tours are also a way to maintain a connection to their homeland, over 3,000 kilometres away.
“The best part is seeing that there are still some people who care enough to listen and understand what's happening in Syria, and want to show their support,” says tour guide Mohamad.
“It means to me a lot because it's giving me the sense that I'm doing something for my country, even if it's just to bring awareness to what's happening there so people can understand it.”"

					11:46 CET+01:00				",AFP,How new German rules are holding refugee families apart,"Germany, trying to staunch the flow of Syrian refugees, has placed high hurdles for them to be reunited with their families, creating a Kafkaesque nightmare in the courts.
As the country enters a decisive election year with anti-migrant populists on the rise, the mass arrival of refugees' wives and children would have created a major challenge for Chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks a fourth term.
Merkel's popularity plunged after the arrival of nearly 900,000 asylum seekers from the world's crisis zones last year, but has recovered of late as arrivals have fallen.
However, for a rising number of the newcomers themselves, many of them men who arrived without their families, the situation is untenable. Critics slam the restrictions as ""inhumane"".
Since the start of the year, 32,551 refugees - the overwhelming majority of them Syrians (28,444) - have filed legal complaints to gain recognition as refugees under the definition set out by the 1951 Geneva Conventions.
Those rules specifically include a right to family reunification.
However the authorities charged with according asylum in Germany, the Federal Office for Migrants and Refugees (BAMF), as a rule now offer only ""subsidiary protection"" to Syrians fleeing a civil war that has ravaged their country for more than five years.
This lower-tier status only provides a temporary residence permit good for one year and subject to renewal, and bars the application for family members to be allowed entry to Germany until March 2018. The process itself can take another two years.
'Inhumane hardship'
Walid, a 41-year-old cook from Damascus, has given up hope of seeing his wife and six children, whom he left in Turkey en route to Berlin, anytime soon.
""I'd be willing to go back to Turkey to be near my children but I'm not even allowed to do that because I have a Syrian passport and you need a visa to go to Turkey,"" he said, declining to provide his full name.
German refugee rights group Pro Asyl slammed the policy for the burden it placed on applicants.
""You have to assume you'll be separated for four to five years. That is an incredibly inhumane hardship for the people affected and their families, who are exposed to war,"" it said.
""There is clearly a political motivation"" behind offering only subsidiary protection to most asylum seekers, Hamburg-based attorney Tobias Behnke said.
""I think the idea is to make Germany less attractive for refugees.""
Last June, 46 percent of Syrian asylum seekers received only subsidiary protection, up sharply from the 14 percent registered two years before, Pro Asyl said.
Battle in the courts
In 2015, at the height of the influx, the vast majority of Syrian applicants - about 96 percent - automatically received full refugee status without even having to undergo an interview at the BAMF.
But from this year, the office has insisted on determining whether applicants personally underwent persecution in Syria to determine their status.
The leftist opposition has protested against the change but Merkel's right-left coalition government insists that the BAMF sets its policies independently.
As a result, about one third of the 100,000 Syrians granted only limited protection have turned to the German justice system since January, forcing courts to take on more personnel to manage the caseload.
Most of the time, the legal battle has proved worth it for refugees.
According to BAMF figures, three quarters of the 3,490 cases already heard have been decided in favour of the Syrians, with judges accepting their argument that they risked persecution by the Bashar al-Assad regime for having fled.
However a higher court last month issued a ruling dismissing the risk, upholding the BAMF's policy of delaying family reunification.
""The higher you go with the appeals, the more political the justice system becomes,"" charged Bernd Mesovic of Pro Asyl.

					17:25 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Why are refugees disproportionately likely to be suspects in sexual assault cases?,"Criminal statistics in Germany have shown that asylum seekers are suspects in rape and sexual assault cases at a rate higher than their representation in society as a whole. Experts discuss the problem.
The Bavarian interior ministry released figures earlier this month showing that 11 percent of all suspects in sex crimes in the first half of 2017 were people who had come to Germany seeking asylum.
This followed national figures from 2016 which showed that reported rape and sexual assault rose by 12.8 percent compared to the previous year. Of the 6,476 total suspects over 800 were asylum seekers, a figure much higher than the relative number of refugees is German society. In the same figures 38.8 percent of all suspects were not Germans, with suspects most likely to be Turkish (15.1 percent), Syrian (9.2 percent) or Afghani (8.6 percent).
“The first factor, which people generally are happy to forget, is the difference in how people report crimes,” argues Christian Pfeiffer, a criminologist at the Crime Research Institute of Lower Saxony.
“Locals are reported less for crimes than strangers because people feel more threatened by strangers.”
A second important aspect is age. Men under 40 are fundamentally more prone to violence and this age group is particularly highly represented among refugees. Around 40 percent of asylum seekers from North Africa are young men.
“These young guys are the most dangerous in every country,” says Pfeiffer.
“It doesn't matter what religion they belong to, men need to learn to control their potential for aggression,” agrees Maggie Schauer, a psychologist at the University of Constance.
This process can take time, she adds.
“In western societies we have a completely different way of living together and a different way of being socialized as in majority-Muslim countries. These cultures can clash against one another.”
Pfeiffer explains that suspects in sexual assault cases are more likely to come from macho cultures “which is true of a substantial number of the people who have arrived as refugees.”
He argues that German authorities need to place much more emphasis on this issue in integration courses.
“Unfortunately there is no special attention placed on this,” says Nora Brezger, who works with refugees in Berlin. She bemoans that fact that some integration courses don't address women's rights at all.
“We need to be much more open about this. We still deal with it as if it's a taboo,” says Schauer.
A third factor in the high rates of sexual assaults among asylum seekers can be hopelessness.
“We have a substantial risk group of people who live here but don't have any chance of gaining asylum or refuge,” explains Pfeiffer.
“Violence prevention is about offering chances. These people also need chances back home. If we make that an attractive option, then we will also feel more security here in Germany,” he said, recommending that the government invest €1 million in return programmes for failed asylum seekers.
Getting the better of high criminality among migrants is a winnable battle, Pfeiffer emphasizes.
“We have followed young Poles, Russian Italians, and Turks who live in Germany over a number of years, and looked at how their criminal statistics have changed - in all these groups criminality sank.""
""So those who say that everything can only get worse, that is completely untrue.”"

CSU leader Horst Seehofer, a harsh critic of Merkel's open-door policy, has revived his calls to cap refugee numbers at 200,000 a year -- a demand Merkel has consistently rejected as unconstitutional.
Seehofer is in no mood to budge after his party too took a drubbing and lost many votes to the AfD, which ran on populist slogans such as ""Stop Islamisation"".
He has vowed to close the party's exposed ""right flank"" with a tough stance on migrants and law and order, as he fights challengers snapping at his heels ahead of state elections next year.
Merkel's CDU too is nervous ahead of a Lower Saxony state poll next week, where it is running neck-and-neck with the Social Democrats (SPD), who are badly in need of a win after their bruising defeat in the September 24th election.
In a speech in the eastern city of Dresden on Saturday, Merkel said that the negotiations would be ""difficult"", but added: ""I hope the coalition will fall into place.""
The emergence of the AfD party, which scored 12.6 percent, has stunned Germany by breaking a long-standing taboo on hard-right parties sitting in the Bundestag.

Its success came at the expense of the mainstream parties, making it harder for Merkel to form a working majority.
Her best shot now -- if she wants to avoid fresh elections that could further boost the AfD -- is an alliance with two other parties that make for odd bedfellows, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens.
Such a power pact -- dubbed a ""Jamaica coalition"" because the party colours black (CDU/CSU), yellow (FDP) and green match those of the Caribbean nation's flag -- would be a first at the national level in Germany.
In the talks to come, all players must give a little to reach a compromise -- but not too much, to avoid charges from their own party bases that they are selling out in a grab for power.
The smaller parties will seek to avoid the dark fate of Merkel's previous junior coalition partners: both the FDP and SPD have suffered stunning losses after governing in the chancellor's shadow.
Until the high-stakes poker games between party chiefs result in a working government, Merkel will be restrained on the global stage and in Europe, where French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for ambitious reforms.
EU and euro politics, in turn, are shaping up as another divisive issue.
Merkel and the Greens have cautiously welcomed Macron's plans, but FDP chief Christian Lindner, who is eyeing the powerful finance minister's post, has assumed a far more sceptical tone.
He rejects any kind of ""transfer union"" -- code for German taxpayers' money flowing to weaker economies -- and said Europe must grow through ""solidarity and competitiveness, not a failed policy of redistribution"".
Lindner has praised, however, Seehofer's tougher stance on migration, declaring that refugee numbers ""must be reduced"".
The Greens, for their part, reject an upper limit, want to stop deportations of rejected asylum seekers to war-torn Afghanistan, and favour steps to help Syrian refugees bring their families.
Even if these issues are somehow resolved, the Greens will also push other core demands unpopular with the pro-business parties -- including setting target dates to phase out coal plants and fossil fuel vehicles.
For now, these talks are down the road, expected to start after the October 15th Lower Saxony vote.
First of all, said CSU lawmaker Alexander Dobrindt, the CDU and CSU must establish whether they are ""still sister parties"".

					08:52 CEST+02:00				",AFP,German 'refugee' soldier case lays bare asylum chaos,"The bizarre case of a German soldier who registered as a Syrian refugee has exposed failings in Germany's handling of a mass influx of over a million asylum-seekers since 2015.
Posing as a Damascus fruit seller, army lieutenant Franco Albrecht, 28, had managed to gain asylum in his home country, obtaining a space in a shelter and monthly benefits of €409 ($447) even though he speaks no Arabic, investigations found.
Officials say Albrecht - who harboured far-right, anti-immigrant views - was plotting an attack that he planned to blame on refugees.
The case, which came to light last week, has sparked an outcry in Germany, where scepticism was already running high over the authorities' ability to competently handle the record influx of refugees.
It adds fuel to criticism of the asylum bureaucracy raised by activists and legal experts over recent months.
Critics have warned that many officials and interpreters are under-qualified, and that chaos engulfing the administration could harm vulnerable victims fleeing the horrors of war.
Conflicting decisions
Take the case of Mohamed Homad, a Syrian refugee from Aleppo, who last October received two conflicting decisions on his asylum application.
In the first letter, he was accorded refugee status which grants him residence for three years as well as the right to bring his immediate family members to Germany.
In the second letter, which arrived just a few days later, however, he was only given subsidiary protection - which rules out family reunion, Homad told AFP.
To his dismay, his lawyer explained to him that authorities claimed that the first letter was just a draft and not valid.
With tens of thousands of refugees arriving in Germany every week in the summer of 2015, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) suddenly found itself drowning in a flood of new files.
Within a few months, BAMF, which is tasked with interviewing asylum applicants and deciding on their requests, had to recruit many more staff, more than doubling its employees from 3,000 to 7,300.
Management accountants, geography experts and even army soldiers were drafted in to fill the gap.
And training given to new case officers was drastically shortened to as little as 10 days from 14 weeks.
'Quantity not quality'
""Only quantity matters, and not quality"", as officials work through a massive pile of applications, charged Sebastian Ludwig of the Protestant Church social organisation Diakonie.
Despite the recruitment drive, the BAMF was running a backlog of a massive 450,000 files in 2016.
Some asylum-seekers were therefore forced to wait more than a year before hearing back on their fate.
Others called in by the BAMF were made to wait hours for their individual interviews before being sent home without being heard as time ran out.
Interpreters, who were recruited en masse and lowly paid, were rarely professionals. In some cases, they hardly knew the language they were meant to translate.
""Increasingly often, people decided on the applications even though they knew nothing,"" charged Hubert Heinhold, a Munich-based lawyer specializing in asylum cases for decades.
""They don't know the basics of asylum law,"" he told Die Zeit weekly.
Refugee rights group Pro Asyl also had sharp words for some practices in the asylum procedure - including that officers examining applications are not always those who had carried out the individual interviews.
""Personal impression is key in making a correct decision because in an asylum procedure, it's the credibility of the asylum seeker that counts,"" said Pro Asyl, pointing out that refugees are often unable to provide material proof of persecution they suffered.
BAMF meanwhile said it would take another look at the controversial practice, even as its chief Jutta Cordt stressed that ""we place big responsibility on each decision made about an asylum request"".
She vowed that ""we will give people the time they need to explain in detail why they decided to flee"".

The 31-year-old German citizen boarded the train at a station in Saxony near the border to the Czech Republic. At a subsequent stop the 15 year old entered the train with two Syrian companions.
According to accounts given by the teenagers, the man started to insult them in the train and gave them the Hitler salute. He then punched the young Afghan in the face.
The teenagers got out of the train at a stop near Plauen, but the man followed them and started to physically assault the young Afghan. When his victim had fallen to the ground, he repeatedly kicked his head against the ground, the refugees recounted.
The teenager was brought to hospital in an ambulance. The police were unable to give further details on the extent of the injuries. The man, who was recorded with 1.9 per mille of alcohol in his blood, is now being investigated for serious assault and a crime with a racist motive.
Hate crimes have risen dramatically in recent years in Germany, as the arrival of over a million refugees from countries such as Afghanistan and Syria in 2015 and 2016 led to a resurgence of far-right movements.
Crime statistics released by the Interior Ministry revealed that a record 39,000 politically motivated crimes were committed in 2015, a surge of almost 19 percent on the previous year. A majority (23,000) of those crimes had a far-right motive behind them.

""We have a new phenomenon, as we have many refugees among whom there are, for example, people of Arab origin who bring another form of anti-Semitism into the country,"" Merkel told the private Channel 10 network.
Her remarks come after an alleged anti-Semitic attack Tuesday in Berlin caused a stir in Germany.
According the German tabloid Bild, the main alleged perpetrator, who surrendered to police, is a Syrian refugee who lived in a centre for migrants near Berlin.
In the interview, Merkel said the German government had appointed a commissioner to fight against anti-Semitism.
""The fact that no nursery, no school, no synagogue can be left without police protection dismays us,"" she said.
Merkel also reaffirmed that Israel's security was a central concern for Germany because of its ""eternal responsibility"" for the Holocaust.

But she rejected the possibility that Berlin would follow Washington's example and move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
""We must work for a two-state solution, and according to that, the status of Jerusalem must be clarified,"" she said.
The US move has angered Palestinians who see east Jerusalem, annexed by Israel, as the capital of any future Palestinian state.
Merkel also reiterated Germany's support for the continuation of the Iran nuclear deal, which provides for curbs to Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for relief from international sanctions.
""We think it's better to have an agreement, even if it's not perfect, than no agreement,"" she said.
Israeli leaders and US President Donald Trump's administration think the deal - signed in 2015 between Iran and the world's five nuclear powers, plus Germany -- is too lax.

The trial begins on Tuesday.
Hussein K. is accused of having raped and murdered a 19-year-old medical student on her bike ride home from a party in the middle of October last year in Freiburg.
The crime made headlines nationwide. His trial begins on Tuesday.
The proceedings have many open questions. Hussein K.'s country of origin is unknown, though he has said he comes from Afghanistan. He had also come to Germany without papers in 2015, stating that he was a minor.
""It is to be expected that the defendant's age will be a subject of evidence during the trial,"" said the head of the prosecutor's office in Freiburg, Dieter Inhofer.
The court is expected to settle whether Hussein K. will be prosecuted as a juvenile or an adult. According to statements he was 17 years old at the time of the crime. But age assessments reveal he may have been at least 21 years old.
He was arrested at the beginning of December, about seven weeks after the crime. His DNA was found at the crime scene and he was identified on CCTV.
A verdict on the case is expected in December.
Due to high public interest in the trial, more stringent security measures are planned, said a court spokesman.
Attempted murder in Greece
One of the most controversial aspects of the case is that Hussein K. had been sentenced to 10 years in jail in Greece in 2013 after he pushed a young woman off a cliff on the island of Corfu.
But at the end of October 2015 he was placed on parole with the requirement to report to police every month. Officials then lost trace of him two months after he was released.
He left Greece shortly after being placed on parole, but only a nationwide search was initiated by Greek authorities, not an international one. Neither Interpol nor the Schengen Information System (SIS) were alerted.
Interior Minister Thomas De Maizière said in December that if the Greeks had launched an international search, ""the suspect could have been detected at various stages of the systematic checks made by German security authorities"".
Greek media also slammed their country's security officials for their mishandling of the prison release programme and for failing to alert Interpol.
The Federation of German Criminal Police (BDK) called the situation a “blatant failure” on the part of Greek authorities. The fact that the data on the fugitive was not shared with the SIS meant that he was not identified by German police as a wanted criminal when he first applied for asylum in Germany.
Sparking refugee debate
Hussein K. applied for asylum in Freiburg when he arrived in Germany in November 2015. This was just a few months after the government opened its borders to refugees and during a time when tens of thousands of people were passing into the country each day.
The murder fuelled growing anti-immigration sentiment in the country. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and far-right Pegida group capitalized on it, blaming German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the crime and arguing it was the consequence of ""uncontrolled migration.""
But Foreign Affairs Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned against ""incitement"" as news of the refugee's arrest spread.
National broadcaster ARD were also in the spotlight at the time. According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, ARD failed to cover the crime and the arrest of Hussein K, despite the fact that other public broadcasters such as ZDF had done so.
Editor-in-chief at ARD Kai Gniffke defended the decision, arguing the broadcaster doesn't cover individual crime cases.
The Freiburg rape-murder story was eventually reported under the regional news section on ARD's web page, Tagesschau.de."

					07:56 CET+01:00				",AFP/The Local,Germany paying refugees cash to head back home,"Germany is trying to induce more migrants to return home by paying their travel fees and in some circumstances giving them start-up cash for when they get back.
Most money is paid out by the REAG/GARP return programme, described as a ""humanitarian aid programme"" by the government, which is run in co-operation with the IOM.
Even people with open asylum applications can apply, Spiegel Online reported on Thursday - not just those whose applications have been refused.
Officials hope that the small extra push will convince those with little chance of receiving asylum or who were already thinking of returning to go.
Simply paying travel costs to voluntary leavers can free up space in refugee homes and be less expensive than forced deportation procedures.
The amount paid out – or whether anything is paid at all – depends on a migrant's country of origin.
REAG/GARP can cover train, bus or air tickets or pay out up to €250 for someone travelling home by car.
Returnees also get €200 – or €100 for children – to cover sundry travel costs.
Meanwhile, there is “starting aid” available for any migrants not from the western Balkan nations. Returners from Afghanistan, Iraq, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ghana can receive up to €500.
In a lower category, “Group 2” - which includes Syria - aid of up to €300 is available.
Funding for REAG/GARP comes from Germany's federal and state governments and is expected to reach €10.1 million in 2016 budget plans.
More than 37,000 people took up the offer in 2015.
Afghan migrants 'voluntarily' head home from Germany
A group of 135 Afghan migrants landed back in Kabul from Germany on Wednesday after volunteering to return home due to a lack of prospects in Europe, officials said.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) arranged the transport and reception of the group, which included 107 males and 18 females including ten children.
It did not say how the Afghans reached Germany or how much time they had spent there.
Applications for assisted voluntary returns from Germany to Afghanistan have significantly increased over the last week, officials say.
The Afghan Embassy in Germany said there were as many as 1,000 Afghan migrants in Germany urgently wishing to return voluntarily to Afghanistan.
""The main reasons invoked by the returnees to go back ... are the limitations they perceive in their long-term opportunities in Germany,"" said IOM chief in Germany Argentina Szabados.
This included ""the limited possibilities for family reunification,"" he added in a statement.
The IOM has run the Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR) programme in Afghanistan since 2003. The number of assisted returns from Germany rose from 92 in 2014 to 304 in 2015.
""The Afghan government welcomes any voluntary returns of its nationals .. from foreign countries,"" Said Hussain Alemi Balkhi, Afghan minister of refugees and repatriation.
The 28-nation European Union has since last year been struggling to cope with a massive influx of migrants, the biggest wave of migration since World War II, fuelled by the war in Syria and Iraq.
German media reported on Thursday that the country could be dealing with 3.6 million new arrivals within its borders by 2020."

Over half of the money was spent abroad aiming to stop the flow of migrants making the journey to Europe.
The total spend of €20 billion was about 0.6 percent of its GDP, according to a government report seen by the Rheinische Post.
The money was split between domestic and foreign programmes, with the federal states receiving €9.3 billion, and €11 billion going to operations abroad aimed at fighting forced migration.
“The number of new arrivals coming from Turkey to Greece has drastically sunk in the last year,” said Peter Altmaier, Angela Merkel's chief of staff and coordinator of Germany's response to the migrant crisis, in an interview with the Rheinische Post.
“It also seems as though the rate of the influx of migrants on the Libya-to-Italy route is falling rather than going up,” he continued. “It looks like our commitment to improving the situation in Libya, Mali, and Niger is paying off.”
In 2016, German troops were based in Mali and Turkey, among other places, to fight Islamic extremism, and to break apart the networks of human traffickers.
“The army has achieved a great deal with its foreign operations, including in the refugee crisis,” Altmaier said.
Over a quarter of the total amount of money spent, €5.5 billion, went to refugees who haven't yet been formally recognized.
Roughly €2 billion was spent on an integration plan for new migrants entering the country. Meanwhile €400 million was spent across Germany on shelter for immigrants, while €350 million was spent on unaccompanied minors.
The document published by the government also outlined the amount of money each federal state was allocated. North Rhine-Westphalia received the most - €1.2 billion, followed by Bavaria which was given €860 million, and Baden-Württemberg receiving €728 million.
The total spend in Germany on refugees is much higher, as the federal government only bore 20 percent of the costs, as set out by a deal with the states in 2015."

Many gay asylum seekers come from countries where their sexual orientation ""is considered a crime,"" de Groot said.
The discrimination, with verbal and physical violence, often continues in Germany as they are targeted by other refugees or even security personnel, he said.
""There are stories of violence in shelters in Berlin,"" which are often crowded and offer little privacy, he said, stressing that people must be able to ""live without fear of violence or discrimination"".

Andreas Hollstein, 54, mayor of the western town of Altena, was stabbed Monday evening at a kebab shop by a man who had loudly criticised his liberal refugee policy.
Hollstein said that without two shop employees who rushed to help him, he would ""probably not be here today"".
With a large bandage on his neck and a wavering voice, Hollstein told reporters that the 56-year-old male assailant had asked him if he was the mayor before pulling the knife and then said: ""You let me die of thirst and take in 200 refugees in Altena.""
Merkel, who has faced a strong backlash over her welcoming stance toward refugees, was ""horrified"" by the attack on Hollstein and ""very relieved that he was already able to return to his family,"" her spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. ""Thanks also to those who helped him.""
Hollstein, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said that he believed ""a coarsening of the public debate about refugees"" had led to the assault.
""I even received emails today approving of the attack -- that says something about the state of our country,"" he said, adding that he and his family had received repeated threats in recent years.
Hollstein said the attacker appeared to be under the influence of alcohol but was by no means incapacitated, noting it had taken three men to overpower him.
The assailant was arrested at the scene while Hollstein was taken to a local hospital and, after treatment, released hours later, police said in a statement, referring to an ""apparent xenophobic motive"".
'Like a good mayor should'
The snack shop owner, Demir Abdullah, who came to Hollstein's aid along with his son, who was also injured in the attack, confirmed the assailant had specifically targeted Hollstein.
""He asked 'are you the mayor?'... then he reached for his knife and stabbed him in the neck,"" Abdullah told German television.
The town of about 17,000 people was well known for taking in a larger share of asylum seekers than required amid the mass influx that has brought more than one million migrants and refugees to Germany since 2015.
Hollstein, whose town won a national award in May for its work with refugees, said Altena had welcomed about 450 people and said he had no plans to reverse his stance.
""I'm going to continue to work for refugees, for those who are already here and for those who are still arriving, for the weak and the strong in our society, like a good mayor should,"" he said.
Justice Minister Heiko Maas tweeted that ""we must never accept that people are attacked because they help others,"" adding that there was no space ""for hate and violence"" in Germany.
The assault revived memories of a knife attack on Cologne's mayor Henriette Reker in October 2015 by a right-wing extremist who was angered at her welcoming stance toward refugees.
The brutal attack came at the height of the influx to Germany, where sentiment is still deeply divided on the country's humanitarian responsibilities and its ability to integrate newcomers.
While most mainstream parties back the principle of Germany taking in people fleeing warzones such as Syria, the backlash led the far-right Alternative for Germany party to win its first seats in parliament in September's general election.
Although Merkel won a fourth term in the poll, the AfD's presence has severely complicated her efforts to cobble together a ruling coalition.
The AfD scored nearly 12 percent of the vote in Altena's electoral district, just below the 13 percent it drew nationally."

reopen in Germany on Saturday weeks ahead of parliamentary elections, after a failed asylum seeker killed one person and wounded five with a knife in the northern city of Hamburg.
Police are expected to offer further details about the incident at a midday (1000 GMT) press conference.
The 26-year-old born in the United Arab Emirates shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is Greatest"") as he fled the scene of the crime in a neighbourhood supermarket before being overpowered by passers-by, witnesses recounted.
The attack had been motivated by ""hate,"" mayor Olaf Scholz said, although he stopped short of declaring it a terrorist incident.
""These criminals want to poison our free society with fear, but they will not succeed,"" he added.
If confirmed as an Islamist attack, it would be the first in Germany since Tunisian Anis Amri drove a truck into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market on December 19th, killing 12 and injuring 48.
But police were unable to immediately confirm the suspect's nationality or identify the motive behind the violence. They have also been unable to confirm the accounts that the man shouted ""Allahu Akhbar"".
News website Spiegel Online reported that the individual was named Ahmad A., who arrived in Germany seeking asylum and had contact with the Islamist scene, as well as a history of mental health problems and drug use.
The attacker had been scheduled to be deported, but the process had been held up as he lacked identity papers, Scholz said.
""It makes me especially angry that the perpetrator appears to be a person who claimed protection in Germany and then turned his hate against us,"" he added.
Images of heavily-armed police searching the Hamburg accommodation centre where the man lived were posted by newspaper Bild on its website late on Friday.
A police murder unit and a squad specialising in politically-motivated crime are investigating the attack.
High alert
Germany has been on high alert over the threat of a jihadist attack since Amri's rampage in Berlin, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
Jihadists have also carried out a string of random assaults in European countries using knives.
Like the Hamburg attacker, Amri was a failed asylum seeker who could not be deported for lack of documents.
The similarity between the two cases risks reopening barely-healed wounds over Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to allow more than a million migrants into Germany since 2015, with just two months to go until legislative elections in September.
""Before Mrs Merkel tweets again that this is 'beyond comprehension': this has something to do with Islam. Comprehend that once and for all!"" politician Beatrix von Storch of anti-migrant, anti-Islam and anti-European Union party Alternative for Germany (AfD) posted on Twitter.
AfD's support has fallen back in polling since the height of the migrant crisis, but the party remains on course to clear the threshold of five percent of the vote to enter parliament for the first time.
Improvised weapons
The attacker stabbed to death a 50-year-old man, believed to be a German citizen, and ""struck out wildly"" at others, wounding a woman and four men aged 19 to 64, police said.
Another 35-year-old man was hurt while overpowering the attacker in the street alongside other passers-by shortly after the killing.
""A crowd of about 30 people ran out of the supermarket. They yelled that someone had been stabbed... we saw a man go past with a big knife, like a butcher's knife, in his hand,"" witness Ralf Woyna told AFP.
Woyna had been sitting at a cafe opposite the entrance to the shop where the chase began.
""Two customers who also looked Middle Eastern took all the chairs from the cafe and ran after him. I lost sight of them for a minute and heard a shout of 'Allahu Akbar' in the distance, I knew it was an attack straight away,"" he added.
An amateur mobile phone video published by news site Spiegel Online showed a handful of pursuers confronting the attacker, a bearded man wearing a T-shirt and jeans, amid dense city traffic.

					10:25 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Germany to deport Afghan refugees only in exceptional cases: report,"German media reported on Wednesday that the government will for now end controversial mass deportations of Afghan asylum seekers, and only deport people in certain cases.
The Interior Ministry and Foreign Ministry have agreed that refugees from Afghanistan will only be deported on an exceptional basis, according to information obtained by publishing group Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
The report confirms that the German government has seriously cut back on deportations after a terror attack killed more than 150 people near the German embassy in Kabul in May.
Deportations to Afghanistan have long been controversial in Germany, with refugee advocates arguing that the country is not safe given ongoing conflicts between the government there and the Taliban. The United Nations reported earlier this year that there had been a record number of civilian casualties in 2016 with nearly 3,500 killed and more than 7,900 injured.
Many in Germany also protested the practice of mass deportations by the government.

According to RND, the number of Afghans deemed as obliged to leave Germany was 10,000 people as of June 30th. That’s a decrease of 5,000 compared to last year. But the number of people who have been deported back to Afghanistan has nearly doubled, from 145 at the end of June 2016, to 282 at the end of June 2017.
Afghan asylum seekers who have been convicted of crimes, or are considered to be “dangerous” suspects can still be deported under the new security assessment, according to RND. People who refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities to clarify their identities could also be deported.
The German government reported in April that about 255,000 Afghans live in Germany."

Speaking after four rampage attacks hit Germany in just seven days - three of which were carried out by refugees - Sahra Wagenknecht said that more needed to be done to help Germans feel ""safer"".
“Although we must wait for a concrete explanation of the background of the attack in Ansbach, we can say this much: The events of the past few days show that the acceptance and integration of a large number of refugees and migrants is tied up with significant problems and is more difficult than Merkel tried to persuade us last autumn with her reckless ‘Wir schaffen es' [we can do it],” the left-wing politician declared in a statement.
“The state must now do everything to ensure that people in our country can feel safe again. That requires us knowing who is in the country and, as far as possible, where there is potential for danger. I think Mrs Merkel and the government now have a particular responsibility to retain the trust of the people in the capability of the state and its security authorities,"" the statement from the leader of Germany's official opposition continued.
Three of the four attacks that struck Germany in the past week were carried out by asylum seekers; the Würzburg axe attack, the machete attack in Reutlingen and the suicide bomb in Ansbach.
It is unclear how many members of the party share Wagenknecht's view. In January, she spoke out after the New Year's sexual assaults in Cologne, saying that those who abused the hospitality offered by Germany had forfeited their right to stay in the country. This was met with backlash from other members of Die Linke, who said that this was not in line with the party's ideology.
The party has traditionally been among the biggest supporters of refugee rights in Germany. For example, its politicians spoke out against German laws which allow refugees' valuables to be confiscated as 'payment' for services they receive in Germany, with chief whip Matthias Höhn calling the practice ""heartless"".
Höhn also seemed to challenge Wagenknecht's latest statement in a Facebook post, in which he said it was necessary to ""counteract"" rather than encourage the fear that people felt in the wake of the attacks. He said that ""absolute security"" is not possible, but that Germany was a very safe country in comparison to many, as well as stating: ""Terrorism did not enter the country with refugees"".
The politician also said that investigation into the recent attacks had only just begun, and pointed to the fact that the four attackers seem to have been driven by different motives. Höhn concluded his statement by saying that ""paying for security with our freedom"" would be ""too high a price"", and used France - which has been under a state of emergency since the attacks on Paris last November - as an example, saying ""every limit on our freedom is a victory for Isis"".
However, Wagenknecht is not the only one to call for better checks to be carried out on refugees, and it is possible that the tide is turning even within her own party.
Andreas Scheuer, General Secretary of the CSU, called for all refugees in Germany to be vetted. “Every single refugee must be interviewed by the authorities and be closely checked, to avoid a general suspicion,” he said.
Rainer Wendt, chairman of the German police union, noted the other factors in the recent attacks when he spoke to radio station HR-Indo. He said that the events of recent days had shown ""how mental instability, terrorism and crime mix together.”
Indeed, the refugee who killed a 45-year-old woman with a kebab knife was known to police for offences of bodily harm, and two of the four attackers had spent time in psychiatric care.
Wendt said that this made it all the more important ""to look at these people very closely, to see whether they pose a potential threat"".
The city of Ansbach has said that it will review and strengthen its project aimed at caring for new refugees arriving in Ansbach; however, Mayor Carda Seidel said she did not think there had been a failure in refugee policy.
Die Linke is the third-biggest group in the German parliament and the largest ootside the government."

A week ago emergency accommodation for 200 Syrian refugees was erected right next to the gym of Wilhelm-Diess-Gymnasium in Pocking, Bavaria, Die Welt reports.
The gym has been closed as a result, and PE lessons have been relocated to a nearby primary school, but the school is still worried about the refugees interacting with students.
So worried in fact that the headteacher recently sent out a letter to parents to give reassurance about extra security measures.
""For the refugees, access to the school gardens and buildings is strictly forbidden. The same goes for the school grounds during the day. The number of teachers on duty during breaks has been increased,"" read the letter from headteacher Martin Thalhammer.
The letter goes on to give students instructions on how to deal with the situation:
""The Syrian citizens are mainly Muslims and speak Arabic. The refugees are marked by their own culture. Because our school is directly next to where they are staying, modest clothing should be adhered to, in order to avoid discrepancies. Revealing tops or blouses, short shorts or miniskirts could lead to misunderstandings.""
The letter has not been met favourably by some parents, but a local politician, who did not want to be named, told Die Welt the move was ""absolutely necessary"".
""When Muslim teenage boys go to open air swimming pools, they are overwhelmed when they see girls in bikinis,"" he said.
""These boys, who come from a culture where for women it is frowned upon to show naked skin, follow girls and bother them without realizing. Obviously this is concerning for us,"" he continued.
The move by the school has caused a lot of discussion, and Thalhammer has received queries from all over the media, reports the Passauer Neue Presse.
""There have never been uniform rules at this school and there never will be."" He said.
""It is my duty to look after the children. Therefore I wanted to inform everyone about what is going on at school and what the gym is being used for.""
""It was my responsibility to remind everyone that two cultures are coming together here,"" he continued."

“If this trend continues around half of all these immigrants will have work in five years’ time,” said IAB research head, Herbert Brücker, on Thursday.
Becker estimated that between 8,500 and 10,000 refugees would find a job every month for the rest of the year.
Pakistani refugees are most likely to have found work, the study found, while Iranians and Nigerians also quickly made their way into employment.
Syrians, who made up the largest group of people seeking asylum, take somewhat longer to make their way into the job market - currently one in five of them is in employment.
Over a million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015 and 2016. The number of arrivals dropped drastically when the EU signed a deal with Turkey in March 2016 which traded financial support for better border control.

In their talks aimed at continuing their right-left ""grand coalition"" after inconclusive elections last September, the parties have also agreed in principle to limit total new migrant and refugee arrivals at around 200,000 a year.
The new policy on family reunions applies to migrants with temporary or ""subsidiary"" protection who have not been formally granted asylum but are temporarily spared deportation.
After a mass influx of over one million asylum seekers to Germany since 2015, those types of family reunions have been stopped, except for so-called ""hardship cases"".
Under the new agreement, to be passed as a law on Thursday, the suspension will be extended until July 31st, after which up to 1,000 relatives a month will be allowed to come to Germany.

Speaking ahead of a visit next Friday by Poland's rightwing Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Merkel said it would be an occasion to open ""a new chapter in German-Polish relations,"" alluding to ""divergent views on some issues"".
The remarks came during Merkel's weekly podcast, and were in answer to a question from a student.
Germany and other fellow EU member states have also criticized Poland over a law enacted on Tuesday making it illegal to attribute Nazi crimes to the Polish state, notably by referencing ""Polish death camps"".
On the refugee issue, the Polish government announced in mid-January, shortly after Morawiecki took office in a reshuffle, that it would not reverse its opposition to the quota system.
Merkel said in the interview that she hoped her talks with Morawiecki would lead to ""united and European solutions"".
Poland's controversial justice reforms, which have also drawn fire from Brussels, prompted the resignation of the head of a Polish body overseeing judicial impartiality.
On December 20th, after months of warnings, the European Commission launched an unprecedented procedure against Poland that could strip Warsaw of its voting rights in the bloc if it does not scrap the reforms.
On Saturday, Merkel noted that all EU member states were pledged to ""respect the principles of the state of law.""
The podcast did not cover the conservative Polish government's decision last year to revive the issue of World War 2 reparations which it believes Germany owes Poland -- an issue that for years had been considered settled.

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere defended the law, which passed by a margin of 376 against 298, as ""a compromise between humanity and responsibility... between generosity and realism"".
The measure was agreed Tuesday in ongoing coalition talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative camp and the Social Democrats, in the hope of launching a new joint government by late March.
Germany, which has taken in more than a million asylum seekers since 2015, stopped family reunions for such ""subsidiary"" status refugees in March 2016 to slow the mass influx.
Those with subsidiary status are not considered political or war refugees, but are temporarily spared deportation on safety grounds.
An increasingly heated debate on immigration has pitted left-leaning parties and pro-refugee groups against conservatives and the far-right, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
AfD lawmaker Christian Wirth argued that refugees should reunite with their families back in their home countries, for example in what he called ""protected zones in Syria"".
He also charged that ""Merkel's 2015 decision to allow German borders to be overrun by a migrant flood... was a flagrant breach of the law"" and accused her government and the EU of a plot to replace Europe's population with Arabs and Africans.
The issue of how many subsidiary-status refugees are allowed to bring their spouses or children had become one of the most contentious in the coalition talks.
Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats also agreed in principle to cap Germany's total annual intake at about 200,000 asylum seekers a year.
Under the new law, family reunions will remain suspended until the end of July, after which up to 1,000 relatives a month, plus an unknown number of yet to be defined ""hardship cases"", will be allowed to come to Germany.
The refugee aid group Pro Asyl slammed the law as ""absolutely insufficient"" and a victory for the ""hardliners"" in Merkel's Bavarian sister party the CSU.

					17:38 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,Arsonists hit pro-refugee art project,"An art installation dedicated to refugees was burnt down in Berlin early on Tuesday, with police suspecting it to be an arson attack.
The ""House of 28 doors"" is an art project in Berlin-Kreuzberg intended to show solidarity with refugees around the world and protest against the EU's asylum policies.
The installation was set aflame in the early hours of Tuesday morning, according to a Berlin police report.
Fire services tried to put out the flames, but could not save the installation. Police suspect the case to be arson because of its symbolic importance to refugees.
Police said they initially arrested a 25 year-old man at the scene, but later released him after witnesses said they did not recognize him. A criminal investigation is now in action.
The installation was originally located in Tempelhofer Park, but was then moved to Kreuzberg's Oranienplatz in August 2014 because of the square's political significance.
Oranienplatz had been the site of a camp protesting against EU refugee policy for over 18 months. The camp was the source of a lot of tension between refugees and local residents, making the area a focus for charities and organizations who help refugees and asylum seekers.
One of these is Give Something Back to Berlin (GSBTB), a charity that works on community projects aimed at ""young, international ‘new Berliners"", and organizes workshops, English classes and other events for refugees.
Lucy Thomas of GSBTB told The Local that the installation had already become a target of anti-refugee feeling, having been broken into and vandalized only last week.
As well as the culture of xenophobia among a minority of people; Thomas cited the heart of the problem as ""the backtracking and unkept promises from the government and city council"".
This means that ""many [refugees] are now homeless and do not have access to basic shelter or any sort of social security"", she added
She also said that tensions and resentment were fuelled by ""the lack of constructive solutions to provide adequate long term perspectives for the refugees.""
Thomas remains positive nonetheless, saying that ""overall Berlin is still for the most part a welcoming and forward thinking city, as seen with our 3000 strong GSBTB Community which is made up of global migrants from all over the world. ""
'Stuck in perpetuity'
The group of artists behind the House of 28 Doors explained its message their website:
""It is dedicated to all those people who became refugees due to the destruction of their basic existence in their home countries, environmental disasters as well as unjust economical and trade conditions.""
""Many of those die at the external borders of the European Union; others reach European territory but find themselves stuck in the perpetuity of the improvised system.""
The 28 doors represented each member state of the EU, and three personal stories of refugees currently living in Berlin are shown on three screens inside the building.
The EU flag that flew over the building was black as a sign of mourning for those who drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean.
This suspected arson attack comes in the context of anti-refugee feeling from certain parts of German society .
There were over 200 attacks on refugees and their accommodation in 2014, which represents a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Last year was also the year where the number of foreigners in Germany hit a record high, while right-wing extremists have been active in recent months, whether it be threatening politicians, attacking journalists or attending anti-Islam Pegida protests."

					08:36 CET+01:00				",AFP,Rural Germany an 'integration laboratory' for refugees,"German villages and small towns could hold the key to socially integrating a mass influx of refugees who would in turn help revitalise dwindling rural populations, experts say.
""The rural regions are a laboratory of integration,"" said Karl-Friedrich Thoene from the infrastructure and agriculture ministry of the eastern state of Thuringia.
Unlike in densely populated big cities, ""there can be no parallel societies in rural areas,"" he said. ""The village community is the ideal chance for integration.""
The lower cost of living, cheaper rents and tight-knit communities in the countryside are main ""factors of success"" for integrating the newcomers, said Gudrun Kirchhoff, an expert on refugee issues at the German Institute of Urban Affairs.
Social life in small communities is typically held together by clubs and associations in which most villagers take part, experts point out.
Germany has taken in more than 1.5 million asylum seekers since 2014, from war-torn Syria to Balkan countries. On arrival, they are allocated accommodation across the country, with cities, towns and villages all expected to take their share.
Dwindling rural populations
Wolfgang Borst, mayor of the Bavarian village of Hofheim, population 5,000, is among those who see the influx as an opportunity.
""We are very satisfied. We are gaining a lot more villagers,"" said Borst, who has long been concerned about Hofheim's dwindling population.
Of four young Syrians living in Hofheim who have just obtained refugee status, ""one will leave, the other three will stay,"" he said.
Borst was speaking at the Grüne Woche (Green Week) agricultural fair in Berlin, which ran until January 24 and where the refugee issue was the subject of many round-table and panel discussions.
Some regard the mass arrivals as a huge challenge, but others see it as a chance.
And for the refugees themselves, frequently traumatized by the war and destruction they escaped, the peace and quiet of the open countryside can be a godsend.
Hofheim and six nearby communities have taken in a total of 224 migrants and housed them in 19 homes. Their joint ""asylum support group"" organizes German language courses, traffic safety classes and sporting activities.
That is not to say that life in remote and isolated communities is free of problems.
Dwellings are frequently far apart, public transport networks are threadbare and people often have to travel long distances to see a doctor or attend a language class.
There are also entrenched social structures, very clear ideas about societal norms and often a ""latent racism"" and distrust of outsiders, said Kirchhoff.
More prosaically, Internet connections are often slow and few supermarkets stock the staple foodstuffs that the refugees are used to.
Dismantling prejudice
Gransee, with a population of 4,000 and located 65 kilometres (40 miles) north of Berlin, has opened up a home with space for 80 refugees.
""Initially, reactions were hostile,"" said Klaus Pölitz, co-founder of an initiative called 'Welcome to Gransee'.
""Our aim was to prepare for their arrival and dismantle prejudice.""
When the first Serb family arrived in 2014, he and the mayor used Google Translate software to write a short welcome speech, much to the newcomers' bemusement, Pölitz remembered with a chuckle.
While refugees are obliged to stay in their assigned accommodation during the asylum application process, they are free to move once they are given refugee status.
And many choose to move to the cities, where more of their compatriots live or the employment prospects are better.
Thoene argued that ""we need incentives to persuade the migrants to stay"" in rural areas.
Gerlinde Augustin, who heads the SDL institute for rural and land development in Augsburg, said care should be taken not to pit the interests of newcomers against those of native inhabitants.
A local family who has waited for months for a kindergarten place, for example, may have little understanding if refugees are awarded a place straight away, she said.
Timm Fuchs, of the German federation of towns and municipalities, argued that not every village should have to take in refugees, only those that are economically strong enough to cope."

A Bavarian lawyer is suing Facebook after two different false stories about the same Syrian man were widely shared across the social network.
Lawyer Chan-jo Jun, who has filed various other legal complaints against the social media giant, implicates Facebook in allowing two different stories about Syrian Anas Modamani to spread.
On Monday, Jun posted a video on his law office’s Facebook page explaining the suit.
Modamani had gained national attention when he snapped a selfie in 2015 with Chancellor Angela Merkel, and a photo of the meeting was widely used by German media.
But that image has since been used on social media alongside claims that he is a terrorist and that he set fire to a homeless man, as well as to denounce Merkel’s refugee policies.
An image of Modamani that falsely claimed he had set fire to a homeless man was shared more than 500 times, but according to the lawyer it did not sufficiently violate Facebook’s “community standards” to be removed. According to Jun, that image can still be found on Facebook.
A sleeping homeless man in Berlin was in fact set on fire at the end of last year by a group of young men, but Modamani was not one of them.
In the summer of 2016, Modamani’s image was also used to falsely compare his likeness to that of a terrorist in the Brussels bombings, with some sites writing: “Did Merkel take a selfie with a terrorist?”
“Anas Modamani is fighting back based on his personal rights so that no person is able to slander him or accuse him of crimes,” Jun said in the video.
Jun got in contact with Modamani through the Austrian initiative Mimikama, which flags fake news stories, according to broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk.
The lawyer has sought to bring charges against Facebook a number of times over the past year, including prompting an investigation into company founder Mark Zuckerberg in November, alleging violations of Germany’s hate speech laws.
“Facebook is unusually difficult about implementing German law,” Jun said in the video.
“For example, slander and abusive insults are against German law, but not against its community standards.”
Jun’s law office is also suing an official from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party for spreading the fake news about Modamani.
The subject of outright false or misleading news reports has bubbled up in debates across Germany, especially regarding how fake stories could influence the election this autumn in which Merkel will run for another term as Chancellor. This has also been an ongoing concern within US politics and after November’s election of Donald Trump.
Police in Rosenheim, Bavaria on Monday said they launched a criminal investigation into a fake news story shared through social media about an asylum seeker supposedly raping a 17-year-old girl.
After looking into the widely shared story, police said they found that it had been completely made up by a 55-year-old woman, who is now under investigation for feigning a crime, as well as for incitement of hatred.
Conservative politicians have also called for tougher punishments for those who disseminate false information."

Posing as a fruit seller from Damascus, German army lieutenant Franco Albrecht, 28, had managed to gain asylum in his own country, obtaining a space in a shelter and monthly benefits of 409 euros ($485), even though he speaks no Arabic.
Investigators said Albrecht -- who harboured far-right, anti-immigrant views -- was plotting an attack that he planned to blame on refugees.
But Germany's Federal Court of Justice said ""the results so far of the investigation do not substantiate the strong suspicion that a serious act threatening the state was in preparation.""
Albrecht, who still faces charges over his fictive life as a refugee, is free while investigations continue, the court said.
The soldier could not remain in police custody on grounds of possible flight risk, the court said, because he has been detained preventively since April 26 -- a period that may have already covered any possible sentence over the charges he faces.
Albrecht's feat at obtaining asylum has illustrated the at times chaotic handling of more than one million asylum seekers who have arrived in Germany since 2015.
It has also underlined the anti-foreigner backlash and a spate of racist hate crimes that have plagued Europe's biggest economy since Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders.
Paying the political price for the refugee influx, Merkel was left without a majority in September's election and weakened by a rise of the far-right party AfD.
More than two months after the polls, the veteran leader is still struggling to form a government and stave off snap elections."

Buildings start to separate and grow taller as you travel from Berlin’s city center to the eastern district of Marzahn. It is a different landscape, populated by towering Plattenbau housing blocks. The roads are wide here: suddenly there is more sky.
Built in the 70s and 80s these housing estates were the largest in East Germany, a vast vision of modern socialist living. The hand of the urban planner can be felt everywhere: buildings all align to an invisible grid.
Today, who these streets are for is in dispute. Beneath the architectural uniformity residents are becoming more diverse and a resurgence of the far-right has reinvigorated Marzahn’s image as a Nazi heartland.
It is the green among the concrete that makes Marzahn a beautiful place to live for Mohammed. He’s lived there for almost a year and, particularly as an artist, values the open space and many parks.
‘Beautiful’ is not a word you expect someone who arrived in Berlin as a refugee to associate with Marzahn. The area has since the 90s had an image as a no-go area for foreigners: type Marzahn into Google and ‘Nazi', ‘racism', and ‘safety’ are keywords that return. After registering one of the highest percentages of support for far-right anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD) in last month’s national election, it is clear the image is not yet an outdated caricature.
Mohammed had heard the stories. “Before I moved to the area, when other refugees spoke of the area it was always danger, danger, danger,” says the painter. “And that if you are Muslim, or look a certain way, people might give you problems.”
It immediately felt different: there was no middle eastern food and no tourists, but the locals were friendly when you got to know them. “Living there isn’t like the stories,” says Mohammed. “I look different and I’ve come home sometimes late at night. No one has touched me.”
Marzahn’s social and democratic profile is a list of highest and lowest stats. High numbers of child poverty and those claiming long-term unemployment benefits and the lowest percentage of residents from an ethnic minority or migration background in the city. Last year it had the highest number of racially motivated incidents and attacks on refugee shelters. As Germany seeks to make sense of the new popularity of the far-right in the old east and where the identity tug-of-war over refugee integration fits into the mix, it has been plucked out as an area to seek answers.

'It is starting to feel unbearable.'
Last month, on the day of the national election, a member of the far-right Identitäre Bewegung party stuck anti-Islam stickers on the windows of the refugee shelter Susanne Weiss manages in south Marzahn. When the security noticed, the person shouted something, ran away, and later threw something at the door.
There has been a noticeable increase in attacks on shelters since 2015, including racially motivated vandalism and acts of arson. Yet the violence, Weiss argues, is not about the area.
""I think attacks on shelters could happen even in a shelter in Neukölln, which is known for being more diverse and tolerant,” says Weiss. “If right-wing extremists want to attack a home for refugees they would probably also go to the other side of the city.”
While in Weiss’ experience neighbours seem more concerned about the potential increase in garbage than foreigners, she is worried about the attitude refugees sense on the street - especially the women. After being insulted on the street while wearing a headscarf, one colleague now feels uncomfortable walking home alone. This, Weiss believes, is likely to be a fraction of what the families living in the shelter experience.
Sara*, who lives in a Marzahn shelter, is one such woman. Often it is just unnerving stares. Sometimes it is people getting up when she sits beside them on the tram, or glaring at her holding a screaming newborn baby instead of giving up a seat.
She has been assaulted verbally and physically, from both adults and children, men and women. It is on the trams and trains that Sara is most fearful. Once, standing waiting on the platform, a 12-year-old spat on Sara while her mother said and did nothing. Last week on the tram a man hit her head with his bag. She thought it was an accident until he started screaming in her face. Sara doesn’t speak much German yet, but caught a few swear words she has come to recognize. People stared silently. She got off the train with her child and burst into tears.
It all adds up. Her skin has broken out: the doctor says it is from stress. Now Sara hates leaving the shelter. “The atmosphere is getting worse,” she says. “It is starting to feel unbearable.”
Sara sees little point in telling the police. Quantifying the scale of negative experiences in the area is a challenge: one wonders how much goes unreported, and how far living in anticipation of assault is a violence of its own.
Her child has also been a target of abuse: he was told by other children at school they wouldn’t play with him “because he was an Arab”. But it is much worse for women, she says. She, like many she knows, now prefers only to venture out with her husband. Her friend had a man try to pull off her headscarf on the bus. Many friends now leave the house without their headscarves - they don’t want to get hurt.
While many women report also feeling unsafe in their shelters, Sara is happy with her camp. “The problem,” she says, “is out on the streets.” When they finally get their own flat she doesn’t mind where it is - so long as it is “somewhere far away from Marzahn”.
Housing shortages

The media focus on Marzahn makes Sascha Langenbach, spokesman for LAF, the Berlin authority in charge of refugee accommodation, uneasy. Could making Marzahn one of the top districts in Berlin for the construction of new refugee housing be seen as a recipe for increasing social tensions? The decision, Langenbach explains, was guided by the limitations of the housing market in 2015, which made accommodating the large number of refugees in 2015 a huge challenge.
“When you look at the inner city districts like Mitte and Kreuzberg there was no space left for public housing of any kind, either for migrants or Germans,” says Langenbach.
“The district administration of Marzahn-Hellersdorf was extremely cooperative and that’s the main reason why the first new buildings were built up in Marzahn,” explains Langenbach. Marzahn may have a particular reputation, but Langenbach points out that there was no district in Berlin that didn’t offer a level of resistance to plans for refugee housing.
Like elsewhere in Berlin, the pinch of the city’s rising rents and housing shortage is felt in Marzahn. Hassan Al Hashem is looking to move out of the Marzahn refugee shelter he has been living in for a year. ""Last week I went to view a flat,” he says. “When I got there I saw there were 30 people for a flat with one room. Twenty of them were German. Why can’t Germans find a room? I found it so sad.”
""I know there are lots of poor people in Marzahn,” adds Hassan. ""But I don’t think they take from others and give to us… However when people are poor they look for something to blame - refugees for example.”
The far-right
Before the wall fell Karin Dalhus learned how to be a Maurerin - someone who builds walls. In her retirement she’s become engaged with the issue of refugee integration, hoping she won’t see the construction of new walls.
She moved to Marzahn in 1985, when it was still a desirable new housing project. In the 90s, she saw the schools and the shops close, and the young move out, as the area felt the effects of reunification. And she has lived to see the area again become a home for both hope and anxiety: a place providing new starts for both refugees and an emboldened far-right movement.
When the wall fell, areas on the edges of the two Berlins suddenly became central, and old centres became peripheral. Marzahn became more of an outskirt. In the 90s the socio-economic story came to mirror the new geography.
The far-right party AfD, who reframed the social question in Germany today as being between ‘outside’ and ‘in’ (the borderline being Germans and foreigners) rather than ‘above’ and ‘below’ have profited in areas like Marzahn. Blaming refugees rather than German bosses for socio-economic marginalization has had particular traction in parts of the old East.
Building bridges
Marzahn may be more ordinary than presumed: the tip of an iceberg sitting underneath the surface of German politics.
“The issue of integration in Marzahn is part of a much wider problem that is nationwide,” says Cordula Bienstein, who has recently led an integration project in the area. ""What Merkel did on humanitarian grounds was right but the government has really got no real plan for what happens next.”
In places like Marzahn, much of the day-to-day work of making integration happen has fallen to civil society. Cordula recently ran a project - Wir Sind Marzahn (We are Marzahn) - where local refugees recorded their stories and experiences in a series of short films.
Hassan, who worked on one of the films, saw firsthand the powerful impact dialogue between old and new neighbours could have at local screenings. On one evening, two local women posed critical questions in the Q&A, but after a short discussion went home feeling positive.
""Another time there were lots of Germans at the screening and I saw one crying,” said Hassan. “I went to him and hugged him. It allowed me to see how much emotion and empathy people have here.""
The stories people tell themselves about their community are important, perhaps whether they are true or not. For both Karin and Cordula the media focus purely on the rising far-right is frustrating.

“Of course the far-right is a problem, but it does not represent all of Marzahn,” says Cordula. ""There are so many great projects here and so much voluntary engagement and we are not hearing about how this is working in opposition.”
While many remain unclear what integration actually means, Karin sees small steps that can be made on the streets: better rubbish management outside the shelter, a lick of paint on its dull concrete walls, benches placed in an open circle on the grass separating it from the opposite block of flats.
At the end of our tour Karin stops beside a willow tree. Few remember that it was planted by the parents of three boys killed during a Soviet military incident in 1945. Old and new neighbours have memories of war in common.
The pub across the road from the willow tree was the heart of the community. “Young, old, married, single, widowed - for 28 years everyone met up here,” says Karin. Now it is boarded up - the landlord was forced to close and register as unemployed.
Not all of the ghosts on the streets of Marzahn are sinister. Karin remembers what an integrated community looks like. “Now there is alienation here,” she says. “The neighbourhood went with the wall”.
There are many different Marzahns, and they are more ordinary than extraordinary. If hostility and violence are in the weft, then acceptance and engagement are in the warp. The future for refugees in the area, as in the rest of Germany, is wide open.
When asked about the graffiti on the electricity box outside the pub, which Karin hasn’t mentioned, she said: “It’s a swastika,” before turning and walking on. “But it is a swastika someone has crossed out”."

					08:27 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Anti-refugee marchers hurl insults and bottles,"One person was injured in fighting after demonstrators gathered outside a former hotel in Saxony for the third night in a row to demonstrate against its use as refugee accommodation.
Police said that 160 people gathered in Freital, on the outskirts of Dresden, to reject the presence of refugees in their town.
A new group of around 50 asylum seekers had to enter the hotel while confronted with the signs and shouted slogans of people who didn't want them there.
Spiegel reported that the demonstrators were chanting “Criminal foreigners – out, out, out!”.
Justice Minister Heiko Maas weighed in on Thursday morning to say that ""calls for violence against refugees are completely unacceptable"".
""The refugees who come to us have lost everything in their homeland"" and are looking for help and sanctuary, Maas added.
Opposite the anti-refugee marchers, around 80 mostly left-wing demonstrators gathered, saying they were on the scene to prevent any attacks against the refugees.
The two sides were kept apart by around 100 police officers.
But the tension got out of hand in the late evening, when the anti-refugee demonstrators threw bottles at the left-wingers, injuring one man slightly.
Police said they had not immediately identified who threw the bottles.
""It's important to me to say clearly that a call for violence against refugees is in no way acceptable,"" Migration Commissioner Aydan Özoguz told the Berliner Zeitung on Thursday.
""This stirs completely awful memories.""
Saxony's own immigration chief Geert Mackenroth said that “some of the expressions of the ringleaders contain calls to violence, at least between the lines"".
Freital has in the past been a stronghold of the Pegida anti-Islam movement. Pegida leader Lutz Bachmann was one of the people to call for a demonstration against the refugee accommodation."

					15:35 CEST+02:00				", The Local,"Chinese tourist loses wallet, becomes refugee by mistake","A young man from China was on a tour of Europe when his wallet was stolen in southern Germany. What happened afterwards is scarcely believable.
Quite how the 31-year-old ended up spending over a week in a refugee home in Dülmen, North Rhine-Westphalia, is not totally clear, broadcaster WDR reported on Monday.
But it appears that he has the German Red Cross (DRK) to thank for finally freeing him from his ordeal.
Indeed, if it hadn’t been for the fact that the smartly dressed man didn’t seem to fit in the refugee home, who knows how long he would have spent there.
DRK worker Christoph Schlütermann was the first to notice that the apparently wealthy man wasn't your normal asylum seeker. But when he tried to communicate with the man, something got lost in translation. Even the use of hands and feet didn't help the DRK worker come closer to understanding why the man was there.
Stumped, Schlütermann went to a local Chinese restaurant where they advised him to use an app on his phone to ease translation.
When he went back to the man armed with a German-Mandarin translation app, it soon became clear: the man wasn’t looking for asylum, he wanted to get to Italy and France.
“I spoke into the app in German and the phone translated it into Mandarin. But when I received his reply, I got the curious response ‘I want to go walking in Italy’,"" Schlütermann told the Dülmener Zeitung on Sunday.
The spectacular mishap began in Heidelberg, almost 400 km to the south of Dülmen in Baden-Württemberg.
While on a visit to the picturesque university town, the 31-year-old from Beijing noticed his wallet was missing.
But instead of signing a stolen item complaint at the local police station, as he thought he had done, the poor tourist ended up signing an asylum application at a different official office, likely the town hall.
As he sat there waiting for the cops to file his complaint, the German authorities started a completely different process.
First they took his passport and gave him refugee documents instead.
He was then transported almost 300 km to Düsseldorf in the west of the country, before being taken a further 100 km north to Dülmen.
At this point the young man still apparently complied with all the regulations which German authorities put refugees through: he allowed them to take his fingerprints, he went through a medical check, and accepted the pocket money which the camp authorities handed out.
Even after the DRK realized the mistake, it took several days before it could be officially confirmed, as on his arrival in Germany his details had not been correctly documented.
But when the asylum application was finally cancelled and the young man set off for southern Europe, he did not even lodge a complaint against the German authorities.
Whether he managed to take that walk in Italy in the end is not yet known."

					12:02 CET+01:00				",DPA/The Local,Robot pals to teach refugee kids German,"Refugee children could soon be learning German with the help of a tiny humanoid robot, thanks to a new project from researchers at the University of Bielefeld.
Scientists plan to spend three years working on their plan to see whether the little androids make it easier for children aged between four and five to pick up the notoriously difficult language.
Along with a tablet computer, 60-centimetre tall ""Nao"" robots made by French company Aldebaran will help the children work through language exercises.
""Teaching every child a second language individually is something kindergartens usually can't manage,"" said Bielefeld University artificial intelligence expert Professor Stefan Kopp.
But the cute robots can have a motivating effect on the children and teach them simple language like numbers or prepositions.
Nao robots cost more than €7,000 and are delivered with a basic operating system and various sensors such as cameras and microphones.
Users like the Bielefeld professors can then add their own programming to adapt Nao for whatever task they have in mind.
Kopp and his colleagues want to set up Nao so that he can recognise and react to the children's level of knowledge and the progress they make while working with him.
""We'll program the robot so that he can lead the interaction with the child, so that the child will be supported as well as possible,"" said research colleague Kirsten Bergmann.
Before Nao can enter a real classroom, though, his effectiveness will have to be examined under laboratory conditions.
The German scientists are also working with colleagues at the Universities of Utrecht and Tilburg in the Netherlands, Plymouth in the UK and Koc in Turkey.
A right royal welcome
It's not the first time Nao has made headlines in Germany.
Students at the Technical University in Berlin taught their Nao unit how to greet Queen Elizabeth II when she visited the German capital in June.
But they only taught him to wave, fearing that a bowing robot might end up in an undignified tumble forwards and spoil the occasion.
The first little machines will be sent into kindergartens in around 18 months to begin the testing.
Meanwhile, here's a little seasonal greeting the University of Freiburg put together with its own Nao robots in 2013."

The tragic death came about when police moved through the train checking passengers' identity documents, Bayerischer Rundfunk reports.
Officers found the young Egyptian hiding under a bench in an empty compartment. When they asked him to show his identity papers, he provided documents that he had been given in Austria.
While the one document recognized the teenager's status as a refugee in Austria, the other ordered his deportation to Italy.
The officers ordered the young man to leave the compartment and wait in the corridor.
But according to eyewitnesses, he used the opportunity to escape into another compartment where he opened the window and jumped out.
The train was still travelling at a high speed through a town called Haar.
The young man landed on an adjacent set of tracks and was killed by the impact.
Police in Munich said the teenager had recently been caught by officers illegally entering Germany and had been sent back to Austria at the time.
It seems that once in Austria, he was ordered to leave the country and go to Italy.
Hundreds of thousands of people have entered Germany over the past six months seeking asylum.
Under the European Union's so-called Dublin rules, refugees are supposed to apply for asylum in the country where they first entered the continent."

					08:57 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'We can do it': Is Merkel's refugee rallying cry a boon or a burden this election season?,"Angela Merkel is not known for her soaring rhetoric. But the phrase ""Wir schaffen das"" (we can do it), used to describe the refugee crisis, came to define her third term as Chancellor. Will it help secure her a fourth term?
Syrian student Moataz Ghannam believes many Germans misunderstood Chancellor Angela Merkel when she delivered her now-famous rallying cry at the height of the refugee influx, ""We can do it"".
""I didn't see it as a statement of fact - 'we can do it right now' - but as a goal: we all need to work together, refugees and Germans,"" the 27-year-old said.
Ghannam's odyssey from his war-ravaged homeland to Europe's top economy represents an unqualified success story - so much so that he was recently invited to sit on a panel with Merkel to measure progress over the last two years.
This autumn, he will begin working toward finishing his bachelor's degree in business administration at a private university in the German capital, using credits he earned in Syria and through the Berlin-based, non-profit Kiron.
Kiron Open Higher Education, which supports 2,700 foreign students, more than 40 percent of whom are Syrian, was one of a handful of examples of ""We can do it"" projects Merkel personally visited ahead of the September 24th general election.
In fluent German, Ghannam told AFP he knew Merkel's confident assessment of the country's ability to take in the newcomers had forced many people to confront their fears of the unknown.
""Germany is a land of opportunities but you have to make an effort - you can't sit at home or expect something from the unemployment office,"" he said.
About 200,000 of the more than one million refugees who have arrived since 2015 have found legal employment to date.
But suggestions for how to bring more applicants into the job market have varied wildly, in part based on the pace of expanding integration course offerings.
Political obituary
In late summer 2015, thousands fleeing war and misery streamed into Germany's railway stations each day.
There were cheering crowds bearing teddy bears to greet the new arrivals, and the influx gave birth to a new word, ""Willkommenskultur"" (welcome culture), appealing to post-war Germany's self-image as a force for good in the world.
But there was also a spreading wave of hostility and chaos, deeply unsettling many Germans, particularly in the depressed former communist east.
Hundreds of arson attacks targeted refugee shelters, angry mobs threatened groups of terrified asylum seekers in rural areas and Merkel's once stellar approval ratings nosedived.
A rash of sexual assaults on New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne, blamed on North African migrants, and a string of Islamist terror attacks, including a deadly truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market nearly a year later, threatened to wipe out the remaining goodwill.
Commentators began writing Merkel's political obituary.
But just two years on, Merkel, in power since 2005, looks set to sail to a fourth term.
Her luckless challenger, Social Democrat Martin Schulz, broadly supports her stance on migration, which voters cite as a top concern.
The numbers of new arrivals have dwindled due to the closure of the so-called Balkan route for migrants and the signing of a controversial deal with Turkey to stem the influx.
Meanwhile the doomsday scenarios conjured up by many sceptics - including some of her closest German political allies and US President Donald Trump - have not come to pass.
Kiron, with 70 employees and around 300 volunteers, calls itself a ""digital bridge"" to help refugees meet admission requirements for German universities.
Co-founder Markus Kressler said the programme was part of a patchwork of initiatives intended to ensure that the initial momentum behind integration efforts is not lost.
""We don't want to have to rely on that can-do spirit lasting - you always have it at the beginning of crisis situations and then the political climate changes,"" he said.
When Merkel is gone
Despite Merkel's lead in the polls, which is around 15 points, the political ground has indeed shifted in the past two years.
The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) has poached disaffected supporters from the mainstream parties and entered 13 of Germany's 16 state legislatures.
Although its support has slipped since a peak in late 2016, it is still poised to capture at least 10 percent, giving it a minimum of 60 seats in the Bundestag lower house.
Merkel - whose centre-right CDU party was hit with back-to-back drubbings in state elections last year - admitted ""mistakes"" and retreated from the ""we can do it"" slogan, acknowledging it had become a lightning rod for naysayers.
But as the mood has brightened, Merkel has returned to her stance that while she was not seeking a repeat of 2015, she had acted in the national interest.
""It was important and right for us to take in these people in an emergency, just as it is right for us to find long-term, sustainable structures (to integrate them),"" she told reporters late last month.
""Not euphoric, more pragmatic - that is the Merkel style,"" commented public radio the next day.
""Whether the country has done it? That's a matter of perspective. We may only know when Angela Merkel is no longer chancellor."""

Based on three million refugees arriving across the EU, the Commission analysis suggested that German GDP would be raised just over 0.12 percentage points in 2015, rising to 0.31 points in 2016 and 0.38 in 2017.
That figure was a net outcome factoring in government spending on refugees.
""Notwithstanding the unprecedented migration flows into the EU during this year and next, the economic impact is expected to be relatively small in the medium term,"" the Commission analysts wrote.
""As illustrated in the simulations for Germany, the impact may be more significant for certain countries,"" especially 'destination countries', they added.
Strong growth ahead
Overall, Germany is in a good economic position thanks to its labour market and the availability of cash to fund business, the Commission found, with low oil prices and government spending on refugees set to stimulate the country further.
But they specifically mentioned the Volkswagen scandal as a ""downside risk"" that could hit exports, along with a general slackening of demand for German products in emerging markets like China.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 1.7 percent in 2015, then 1.9 percent in the two following years.
And despite additional spending on refugees, the government budget is expected to remain in surplus, rising from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 0.9 percent in 2015.
By 2017, government debt is set to be almost 10 percent lower than it was in 2014, at 65.5 percent of GDP compared with 75 percent last year.
Over 750,000 refugees now in Germany
The Commission report came on the same day as Germany's Interior Ministry revealed that the country had registered 758,000 asylum applications from January to October this year.
In October alone 181,000 people formally asked for refuge, outstripping the previous record of 163,000 set in September.
Germany is expecting to receive up to one million asylum seekers this year, and the sudden surge has left local authorities scrambling to cope.
Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis topped October's arrivals while the number of migrants from Balkans states has fallen sharply compared to previous months after Berlin took a firm line against what it deems economic migrants from those countries.
Germany has also begun looking at limiting arrivals from Afghanistan, with Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere saying last week that the rising number of asylum seekers from the war-torn country was ""unacceptable"".
""There is an increasing number of citizens from the middle class, also from Kabul, and we are in agreement with the Afghan government that young Afghans from middle-class families should stay in their country and rebuild it,"" he said.
There has even been talk of using German troops to create ""safe zones"" in Afghanistan to encourage people to stay in the country.
Germany recorded 31,000 Afghan asylum seekers in the month of October."

Figures from the Federal Criminal Police Office seen by the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (NOZ) show that 8,991 refugee children and teens were reported as missing as of July 1st.
That number is more than the total reported in 2015 and nearly double the 4,749 underage refugees reported at the beginning of the year.
Most of those missing were between the ages of 14 and 17 and the BKA told NOZ that in most cases, criminal activity was not suspected.
“The Federal Criminal Police Office does not have concrete information available that a portion of the missing underage refugees could have fallen into the hands of criminals,” the BKA told NOZ.
Instead, the BKA said that many of those who went missing may have left refugee accommodation centres with relatives or friends to go to other German cities or European countries. They often do not notify authorities when they are picked up by family members.
The BKA has previously also told The Local that the numbers of missing children could be distorted if kids are reported as missing in multiple places, or with slightly different personal information.
But NGOs like Missing Children Europe have warned that unaccompanied child refugees in particular are vulnerable to criminals.
“In many cases [unaccompanied refugee children] are also forced to leave because they are or have become victims of trafficking, including labour and sexual exploitation, forced begging and drug smuggling,” Missing Children Europe writes on their website.
The German Association for Unaccompanied Underage Refugees (BumF) wrote in a report earlier this year that they also assume many children and teens independently leave refugee centres to join relatives or to search for better living conditions elsewhere.
However, the report also states that it cannot be ruled out that some may be trafficked or exploited.
“There is evidence that unaccompanied minors are forced into prostitution or theft because, for example, they must pay back a debt to a people smuggler,” BumF explains.
“The extent of this is unknown. It is the responsibility of the German government to support children and youth in their rights, and to protect them from danger.”"

A preliminary report by the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) shows 970 crimes committed against asylum homes in 2016, according to reports by broadcaster NDR, the Süddeutsche Zeitung and news agency EPD on Thursday.
States reported another 2,396 crimes against refugees outside of homes last year, according to EPD.
The number of crimes against asylum homes was a drop from 2015 at the height of the influx of refugees arriving in the country, when 1,031 such crimes were reported. Both numbers were roughly five times higher than the crimes recorded in 2014 - 199.
But officials had not separately recorded crimes against refugees outside of shelters before, thus there is no available comparison for the figure of close to 2,400 incidents.
While overall crime decreased at refugee centres, the incidents reported seemed to increase in violence. The number of assaults reported rose to 78 last year from 60 in 2015, and the number of cases that involved guns almost doubled, from 31 in 2015 to 57 last year.
Still, the number of arson attacks did drop, though the media reports did not specify online by how much. Outside of refugee homes, there were nearly 400 cases of assault.
Last week German police launched raids across the country in an investigation into a right-wing extremist terror group that was believed to be plotting attacks on asylum seekers, Jews and police. Two men were arrested, one of whom had been identified as part of the so-called Reichsbürger movement - people who do not recognize the legitimacy of the German government.
“Our nation has shown that it can defend itself - and have a sharp eye toward - right-wing extremism, right-wing violence and right-wing hatred,” said Baden-Württemberg interior minister Thomas Strobl at the time.
Meanwhile the trial of eight members of a suspected right-wing terrorist group in Freital is set to begin in March in Dresden. The seven men and one woman are accused of committing at least five xenophobic or politically motivated attacks against refugee homes or political opponents, and face charges of forming a terrorist group, attempted murder, causing explosions and grievous bodily harm."

					14:59 CET+01:00				", The Local,Refugees must learn to respect German values,"Immigrant to Germany and academic Ashley Nunes argues that refugees arriving in the Federal Republic must respect its values if the public's fears are to be overcome.
Two weeks ago, Klaus Bouillon, a politician from Germany's reigning political party appeared on national television to discuss a recent visit to an asylum center. What he had seen clearly worried him.
Some migrants were insulting female volunteers simply for being women, some were refusing to eat meals because the women serving those meals were viewed as ‘unclean,' and others were fighting to get to the front of the serving line when it wasn't their turn.
When the moderator asked Bouillon why he decided to make these concerns public, Bouillon emphasized the importance of being truthful with Germans, saying, “we cannot tell the people that integration will be easy when it won't be”.
The Chancellor, or ‘Mama Merkel' as many migrants affectionately call her, has a different perspective. “We can do it,” she insists, a catchphrase that increasingly seems to instruct the ordinary Germans they will do it.
Merkel's current stance on asylum seekers is a far cry from the summer. Back then, she told a 14-year old Palestinian refugee living in the north of Germany, “We can't accept everybody.”
Embracing that attitude today is met with accusations of xenophobia, a worry shared by Bouillon when he made some of his experiences known.
But this tactic robs the voice of large segments of the population who are increasingly nervous over what sudden large-scale immigration means for their daily lives.
Their discomfort is evident in public opinion polls that show waning government support in favor of anti-immigrant parties and growing concern over Germany's ability to manage the numbers of people arriving.

Contrary to popular belief, reversing this trend does not require that Germany's borders be sealed - rather, the country must insist on its own laws and values.
One of the Federal Republic's greatest post-war achievements was its adoption of the Grundgesetz, known in English as the Basic Law.
Crafted with the intention of preventing a dictatorship from rising again in Germany, the law contains explicit provisions for asylum requests. It is therefore essential that all applicants have their requests considered.
But the law also emphasizes human dignity regardless of gender, sexual orientation and nationality. Hence, it is equally essential that all migrants understand and accept Germany's refusal of intolerance.
Until now, attempts to convey this idea have involved handing out copies of the Grundgesetz to new migrants. The result? Fights over food that is not to the liking of the migrant palate, clashes over who gets to use the toilet first, and brawls over uncomfortable beds.
The country's Interior Minister often responds to these incidents by pleading for asylum seekers' “understanding”. One wonders if he dare ask the same of those selfless female volunteers who have been on the receiving end of verbal tirades from some migrants.
The German government is so fearful of being labeled inhumane towards asylum seekers that it errs on the side of appeasement. But appeasement merely legitimizes actions that would in other countries attract the full force of the law.
This practice must end. Merkel must send a clear message to those who seek refuge within Germany's borders: We will promptly and fairly consider your asylum request, but you will be held accountable for your actions. You will be viewed unfavorably should you engage in discriminatory behavior. Physical violence is grounds to reject your asylum request altogether. Our resources are limited and we reserve those resources for those who respect our laws.
Such an approach may seem tough. It is, but it is also fair: fair to millions of Germans who have volunteered their time to welcome strangers to their land. And fair to the hundreds of thousands of peaceful migrants who have escaped untold horrors to seek refuge in a country that values human dignity above all else.

					16:48 CET+01:00				", The Local,Life in suspense: the refugees in Germany who can't reunite with their families,"One of the most disputed issues in the current coalition talks is whether war refugees should be allowed to bring their families to Germany. While parties refuse to compromise, refugees live with the consequences.
Jihad, a neatly shaven man with salt and pepper hair, pulls up a recent picture on his phone of his daughter riding her pink bike for the first time. The Syrian never got to see his daughter making her first wobbly journey on two wheels though - the photo was sent to him by his wife. He hasn't seen his family in over two years.
As is the case for over 200,000 other refugees in Germany who have only been granted “subsidiary protection”, Jihad's family cannot come here.
In early 2016 the public mood in Germany began to turn against the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who had arrived in the country over the preceding months.
Mass sexual assaults by men from North Africa and the Middle East in Cologne at the start of the year unleashed a public debate on the compatibility of refugees with German values. The government responded by putting family reunifications for war refugees on ice.
As of March 2016 only people who can prove they were personally persecuted in their homeland have the right to reunite with their family in Germany.
Now the issue of Familiennachzug (family reunions) has once again come to prominence. It threatens to become the make-or-break issue on which coalition talks to form a new German government could founder.
Despite weeks of negotiations, the Green party are still seas apart from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) on the issue. While the Green party are demanding that, as of March 2018, war refugees be able to bring their families to Germany, the Bavarian CSU want to maintain the embargo.
Green party leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt has accused the CSU of betraying their commitment to family values. The CSU though, have lost voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany, as German voters protested against the level of immigration that has taken place over the past two years.
Jihad and his family fled the violent chaos of Syria in 2015. They came via Egypt intending to take a boat together to Italy and then travel the 2,000 kilometres or so up to Berlin where four of his siblings, who arrived in 1992, already run a small restaurant in the west of the city.
The restaurant is wooden and extended with plastic sheeting.
“I spend most of my time here in the restaurant,” he told The Local. “We love to gather around together as much and as often as possible. That's why we thought we could best take advantage of the situation by ensuring we stay close to one another.""
In his home country it's usual for extended families to live together as a core unit; it takes something big to split them up.
Leaving his family was not a decision Jihad took lightly. In 2014, reports of floating bodies from boats intentionally shipwrecked by traffickers flooded the media and Jihad says he was forced to make an unwelcome choice.
“The way was unknown, and at the time you heard a lot about boats sinking and people dying trying to get to Europe, I would not have been able to live with myself if anything bad was to happen.”
As the head of the household, he made a bid for a safe and stable life alone - in order to pave the way for his wife and children - never expecting that protecting them would mean a long term, perhaps permanent separation.
Birgit Laubach, head of the legal staff of the Green parliamentary group since 1990, sees Germany's measures as a threat to family unity which contravene basic German law, the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 8) and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Figures provided by the German immigration authority show asylum seekers are more likely to be men than women and for the last ten years this trend of gender inequality is consistent across Europe.
Yet this is not because refugees in general are more likely to be men. In statistics registered by the UN, out of the 2.1 million refugees registered in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon there's an even split in gender: about 50.5% are women and 49.7% are men.
According to an UNHCR report, there are several possible reasons for this discrepancy, perhaps most obviously that these bordering countries more easily accessible by potentially less physically able members of the family - women and children.
The UN also reports that these countries are more similar in their cultural attitudes, and more likely to recognize the concept of dependency when it comes to the wider family.
Widows, elderly parents or 'adult' but not yet married women are accepted as economic dependents, whereas the European definition of core family, even when refugees are accorded a full asylum status with family reunion, is limited to spouse and adolescent children.
As heads of the household, men like Jihad are more likely to make the journey to Europe because of the real or perceived dangers. When male children of the family left behind reach adulthood, they are more able to do the same thing, whereas women travelling alone without a man, would risk - as they see it - more than just their lives: they risk their honour.
There are different perspectives on why. According to one Afghani woman, a refugee who preferred to remain nameless, a woman's honour is so precarious and the loss of it so harmful to the entire family, that no man would willingly compromise the honour of a woman in his family unit.
”A woman travelling alone is an admission that she is already a shameless woman, a woman without honour”, she told The Local. “That makes her an easy target.”
Research conducted by Amnesty International in 2016 gives a different, more general view.
“Women and girl refugees face violence, assault, exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey, including on European soil,” the NGO states.
Jihad's family are comparatively lucky. When the family fled to Egypt, his parents accompanied them.
”The only thing that keeps me going is knowing my wife is taking care of my parents, and my father is returning the favour,” he says.
Nevertheless Jihad still hopes for family reunion.
”If there are no problems, I may be able to see them in 2018 or a little after. But any longer, and we will all have to move somewhere else entirely. I have to be reunited with them. The situation is depressing, and it really takes its toll, I know it has on me.”

					13:05 CET+01:00				",AFP,Polls show most Germans fear refugee burden too great,"Most Germans now doubt their country's ability to cope with a record migrant influx, and fear refugees more, after the New Year's Eve mass assaults on women in Cologne, opinion polls released Friday show.
A survey by public broadcaster ZDF found that 60 percent of respondents believe Germany cannot cope with the large numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015.
The Cologne attacks clearly had an impact, the broadcaster said, as only 46 percent of people surveyed in December felt that way.
The poll of 1,203 people over January 12 to 14 also found that a majority (56 percent) are now dissatisfied with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policies, up from 49 percent in December.
Seven people in 10 fear the influx will lead to more crime, compared to 62 percent in October.
And a growing minority, now at 42 percent from 33 percent in October, say they fear their cultural values are under threat.
A separate survey by the group DeutschlandTrend for the state TV ARD found that 51 percent of German adults said they do not believe Merkel's repeated claim - ""we will manage"" - that Germany can absorb the inflow.
In October, 48 percent of respondents said they had this view.
The poll also found that 48 percent of those surveyed said they were afraid of refugees, while 50 percent said they did not have this view. That question was not asked in October.
The survey covered 1,000 people who were interviewed by phone on January 12 and 13.
Hundreds of women were groped and robbed in a throng of mostly Arab and North African men outside the main railway station of Cologne.
The tally of criminal complaints reached 652 by Thursday, including 331 sex-related crimes, Cologne prosecutors said.
The case has inflamed tensions in Germany, which took in nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, mainly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, and put pressure on Merkel for her welcoming stance toward refugees fleeing war.

					10:17 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Ex-child refugee retraces escape from Nazi Germany on a bicycle,"Paul Alexander was just a toddler when his mother handed him to a volunteer nurse on a train leaving Nazi Germany in 1939.
Now 81, the former refugee child will on Sunday begin retracing that journey to freedom -- but this time by bicycle as part of a commemorative ride to pay tribute to the Kindertransport scheme that saved him and thousands of Jewish children eight decades ago.
""I did this journey 79 years ago when I came out from the hatred of Nazi Germany to the safety in England. I'm going to do that ride,"" he told AFP.
""The thought that came to my head is that this is my answer to Hitler, to sort of prove to myself, to show the world and to express my thanks for succeeding in life and being a happy married man with a family.""
Alexander will be doing the 600-mile (1,000-kilometre) bike journey with his 34-year-old son and 15-year-old grandson.
Besides the trio, 39 other cyclists will be on the six-day journey taking them from Friedrichstrasse in Berlin to Liverpool Street in London, via the Netherlands then aboard an overnight ferry to Harwich in England.
Some are descendants of children rescued 80 years ago, while others are cycling in memory of the escapees in the fund-raising ride initiated by the World Jewish Relief, an aid organisation that grew out of the agency that carried out the rescue effort.
""We have organised this ride as a tribute to the amazing life-saving work of our predecessors,"" said Rafi Cooper, director of communications for the charity, which maintains historical records from the period.
""Tens of thousands of people would not be alive today were it not for their heroism back then.""
A tough decision
After the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) pogroms on November 9, 1938, a group of Protestant, Jewish and Quaker leaders appealed to then British prime minister Neville Chamberlain to allow in unaccompanied Jewish children.
A rescue effort mobilised swiftly, and the first Kindertransport arrived at Harwich on December 2, 1938, carrying 196 children from a Berlin Jewish orphanage which had been torched by the Nazis on Kristallnacht.
Over 18 months, 10,000 children fleeing persecution in Germany, Austria, Poland and what was then Czechoslovakia, were brought to safety in Britain. Younger children were placed with families while those above 16 were given help to obtain training and employment.
The last transport left from the Dutch port of Ymuiden on May 14, 1940 -- a day before the Netherlands surrendered.
For many parents, leaving their children with strangers not knowing if they would see each other again was not an easy decision.
'Symbolic victory ride'
Alexander's mother, who suffered two stillbirths previously, had agonised over what to do with her only child.
""Sending a child of one year and eight months away, you'll appreciate, is heartrending,"" said Alexander.
What they did not know is that both his parents would soon join him in safety. His father arrived in England 13 days after him and his mother on September 1, 1939, the day the Nazis invaded Poland and launched World War II. The family was finally reunited for good three years later, having all escaped the Holocaust in which six million Jews were exterminated.
Alexander himself later trained as a lawyer and married an Israeli living in London. They have three children and nine grandchildren and now live in Israel.
The sprightly 81-year-old retired from the bank where he worked as its legal counsel in 2002, but still works today as a notary.
For him, Sunday's journey is ""a symbolic victory ride"".
""It is a very meaningful and poignant way of celebrating my life. I thought it was poignant to do it with my child and grandson."""

they called Berlin's refusal to allow them to reunite with their families.
Some 150 people including Iraqis, Afghans and ethnic Kurds, from various camps in mainland Greece, held up signs in English reading ""The right to reunite is not a crime"" and ""No more waiting.""
""Germany wants to block or delay reunion and leave our families divided,"" Shaker Khalil, one of the protest organizers, told AFP.
""At the moment, just 70 cases are accepted on a monthly basis when three times that number is needed,"" he said.
Greek police refused to allow four representatives to deliver to embassy staff a list of demands, which they said concerned urgent cases of ailing refugees or minors.
An official letter leaked by a Greek daily in May pointed to a tacit understanding between Greek and German migration officials to limit the number of reunification approvals.
""Family reunification transfer to Germany will slow down as agreed,"" Greek Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas wrote to German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere in a May 4th letter obtained by leftist daily Efimerida ton Syntakton.
Mouzalas has said the slowdown was due to ""technical difficulties.""
Asylum seekers -- mostly Syrian refugees in Greece's case -- are entitled to join family members elsewhere in the European Union within six months from the date their request is approved.
In his letter, Mouzalas said Berlin and Athens had to agree on a ""common line"" so that Athens is not blamed for the delays.
Greece is housing some 60,000 mainly Syrian and Afghan refugees and migrants in camps around the country.
Many have become desperate to be allowed to continue their journey after several EU states shut down their borders last year, while others fear they will be deported to Turkey."

Refugees will begin moving into Berlin's disused Tempelhof Airport ""in the next few days,"" Mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller, told broadcaster RBB.
As the former airport winds down after last weekend's Lollapalooza festival, 800 refugees are set to move into one of the former hangars.
A heated airdome will be erected inside the hangar, and portable toilets installed for last weekend's festival will remain in place for asylum seekers to use, Müller explained.
Those staying at Tempelhof will also have access to sanitary facilities at the nearby Columbiabad swimming pool – with shuttle-buses provided to and from the pool.
The eventual aim is to transform two of the former hangars into accommodation blocks, Berliner Morgenpost reports.
A lifeline for Cold War West Berliners
Berlin's Tempelhof airport closed in 2008, after over 80 years of service.
The airport's original terminal was built in 1927 and was reconstructed by the Nazis in the 1930s.
At over 300,000m², the main terminal is one of the largest buildings in the world.
During the Berlin Blockade in 1948 and 1949 Tempelhof played a key role in the Allied Forces' famed Berlin Airlift.
The Airlift saw over 2.3 million tonnes of food and fuel delivered by plane into the western part of Berlin which had been blocked off from the rest of Germany by Soviet troops.
Tempelhof continued in operation until 2008, when protests failed to stop the airport closing down.
The grounds - named Tempelhofer Feld - are now used for a variety of festivals, public events and recreation.
'Up to a million' refugees could arrive in 2015
With unprecedented numbers of people seeking refuge in Germany – and newest estimates suggesting up to a million could arrive in 2015 – local governments are struggling to house the new arrivals.
Those seeking refuge in Berlin register at the city's Health and Social Affairs Administration (LaGeSo) - but the centre has become increasingly overwhelmed by applications,
""We can only register between 100 and 150 people a day,"" a LaGeSo spokesperson told the Berliner Morgenpost. This means those arriving in Berlin now face long waits for registration.
At the moment, Berlin's largest emergency refugee camp is in the Schmidt-Knobelsdorf barracks in Spandau.
Around 1,700 people - including 250 children - currently live in buildings and tents on the site, and are cared for by doctors and nurses from Berlin's Charité University Hospital."

The Local's Hannah Butler was amongst the boat's passengers - and was shocked by what she experienced.
Clambering down onto the dinghy's bulging rubber edge, my legs almost gave way. I couldn't trust myself not to pitch head-first into the freezing water – but thankfully, two Sea Watch volunteers had me by the arms.
""Left,"" one of the team instructed me. I staggered in the direction of his finger, glancing stupidly around. Life-jacketed MPs and journalists were already shoulder-to-shoulder around the boat's edge. Was there room for one more?
Oh yes. It turned out there was room for many, many more.
Bringing the horror home to MPs
Our captain on Tuesday was Ingo Werth.
Werth is a volunteer at Sea Watch, a force offering lifesaving aid to those crossing the Mediterranean between Libya and Italy.
He usually captains a Sea Watch vessel seeking out refugee boats in distress to offer first aid, food, water and life-rafts for between 300 and 400 people at a time.
But today's voyage was a little different. Swapping the Mediterranean for the River Spree, and the Sea Watch boat for a rubber dinghy, Werth was about to take us on a trip we wouldn't forget in a hurry.
The aim? To give German MPs – and the rest of us - a glimpse of the horrors faced by refugees crossing the Mediterranean on dinghies that just aren't meant for the high seas.

CDU have 'shut their eyes to reality'
“We brought an original refugee boat to the Reichstag today to give MPs the opportunity to physically experience what it means to flee on one of these boats,” Ruben Neugebauer told me.
As a crew member and photographer for Sea Watch, Neugebauer had hoped to reach MPs from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and their Bavarian allies the Christian Social Union (CSU) – but was disappointed with the turnout from these leading parties.
“We'd hoped for more enthusiastic participation from those in charge, who approved this impossible ‘Mission Sophia,'” (the European Union's anti-people smuggling operation) he told me. “But obviously, they've shut their eyes to reality.”
Some MPs from these parties did come along though, he said – adding: “We hope they'll take this experience back to their parties and tell their colleagues how it feels to have to flee on one of these boats.

""We're bringing the disastrous circumstances in the Mediterranean to the Bundestag:""
'Parliament ‘isn't properly informed'
Sea Watch aids refugees in distress between Libya and Italy – but theirs is a task that wouldn't be necessary if EU refugee policies were changed, they argue.
On October 9th, the second phase of an EU naval mission targeting human traffickers in the Mediterranean off Libya went into effect.
As part of ‘Mission Sophia,' the United Nations Security Council gave EU naval operations authority to seize and dispose of vessels used by human traffickers in this area.
The mission aims to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into Europe.
Around 130,000 migrants have arrived in Italy since the start of 2015, The Local Italy reported earlier this month. Most of these came from Libya.
Thousands die making the crossing - with numerous incidents in August alone leaving hundreds of people missing and feared dead, the UN Refugee Agency reported.
But as far as Sea Watch is concerned, targeting human traffickers is the wrong approach.
“If the German parliament thinks that the answer to the repeated disasters on refugee boats is to launch armed operations against the so-called illegal people smugglers, this just shows it isn't properly informed on the situation in the central Mediterranean,” said Frank Dörner, chief medic at Sea Watch.
“In reaction to this, we're trying to make tangible the desperate situation that refugees find themselves in when they have no legal way to get to Europe.”

A tight squeeze
""How many?"" Werth kept shouting to those counting us on.
40... 60... 80... the numbers kept rising and still we weren't up to capacity. Not even close.
Hovering at the rear while the crowd thickened, I soon struggled to stay upright. ""Careful,"" a Sea Watch volunteer warned as I teetered backwards.
I glanced behind. The boat's outboard motor was almost touching the backs of my legs. And after that – scarily close – was the water.
""Just 41 more,"" Werth announced. 41? It was already too cramped back here. Pressed up against other passengers, I couldn't twist my body into a position that felt natural.
Somehow, a space cleared for me on the rubber edge. Gratefully, I sank into it.

“Unfortunately, not many of those MPS whose opinions we really wanted to change turned up today,” she admitted.
“We would have liked more CDU and CSU politicians to come along,” she told me.
However, they did have a good turnout from the Left Party, as well as a few SPD politicians, she said.
""There was a lot of interest,” she said, with many MPs asking the team questions and having discussions on the topic.
“They told us it was a good campaign,” she said, “and that they'd now got a sense of how these people feel.""
With all seating room taken, the boat continues to fill. Photo: Hannah Butler
Fumes, fear and overcrowding
Eventually, 120 of us were on board.
""We'll do a short trip around the harbour,"" Werth announced, instructing us to hold on tightly and not move around too much.
He then pulled the starter cord a few times, and fired up the boat's outboard motor.
Immediately, we were engulfed in fumes. Passengers began to cough and cover their faces. But as the smoke cleared, we set off.
We can't have spent more than 10 minutes circling the harbour. Even so, the strain of keeping my torso upright and inside the boat left my core muscles aching, while my legs shook from the constant tension - and fear - coursing through my body.
Fear that my feet might lose their purchase on the slippery planks, that I'd adjust my position and end up toppling backwards into the icy river.
Fear of the growing puddle of water seeping in around my feet from the edge, and the way the back of the boat – the only thing separating us from the water – wobbled every time Werth yanked at the motor.
And fear stemming from the terrible sense that there were far, far too many people on this boat.

'It's very different to experience it for yourself'
Agnieszka Brugger is a Green Party MP. A spokesperson for security policy and disarmament, she is also chairwoman of the Defence Committee.
For her, the experience on the boat felt extremely oppressive. But, she told me, it was still “incomparable with what refugees making their way across the Mediterranean have to experience.”
I asked whether it had changed her views on the way people seeking refuge are brought to Europe.
Not really, she said – but “it's very different to experience it for yourself, rather than simply reading about it or talking to people who have been through it.”
“It's extremely dangerous,” she said, adding that she “couldn't imagine spending hours on one of these boats in the Mediterranean.”
One thing's for certain: this is not a mode of transport Brugger herself would opt for.
“To me, it doesn't seem safe,” she told me, “and there have been so many fatalities in the Mediterranean.”

Helpless
Brugger's right: what we experienced on this chilly October afternoon in Berlin was nothing – absolutely nothing – compared to the treacherous journeys of the men, women and children who make the crossing between Libya and Italy.
For a start, we were all given life jackets - something most of these refugees don't have the luxury of, according to Sea Watch.
And we were only making a slow trip around the harbour. If someone fell off, at worst they'd get cold and wet and have to buy a new iPhone. They'd get hoisted to safety straight away.
But our slow, 10-minute chug around a quiet harbour left me aching and terrified - so it's unimaginable what those who travel on similar boats for days on end go through.
There's no respite. No corner to tuck yourself away in, no solid surface to brace yourself against, and no guarantee that you'll come out alive.
How can you fall asleep knowing that one false move could send you or others tumbling into the sea for the last time?
Turned into cargo
Perhaps the worst thing, though – far worse than the lack of space and the discomfort – was how helpless the whole thing made us.
The very nature of this kind of transport turns passengers into cargo. Packed to full capacity, we were like livestock, stripped of personal space, comfort and pride.
I'm used to being able to rely on my legs to hold me up. But by the time I disembarked I was helpless, forced to stumble clumsily to the boat's edge while four men hoisted me back out onto solid ground.
After giving up their money, possessions, homes and countries, those fleeing Libya for Italy also give up responsibility for their own lives when they board one of these boats.
If my brief spell aboard taught me anything, it's that no-one would willingly opt for this. Not if there was another, legal way to safety.
These boats are dangerous, they're unsuitable, and they're terrifying.
But I suppose that's the message Sea Watch wanted to get across to German MPs who clambered aboard in front of the Reichstag on October 13th.

					11:34 CEST+02:00				",Jörg Luyken,Will Merkel’s concession on a refugee cap help her form a new government?,"Angela Merkel is entering the trickiest coalition talks she has yet faced. On Sunday she met a compromise with her Bavarian sister party on one of the key conflict points - refugees. But will the agreement alienate the Greens?
Handelsblatt claimed on Monday that the famed escapist Harry Houdini had made an intervention in German politics over the weekend.
At a summit on Sunday between Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), the two sister parties managed to come to agreement on an argument that has hammered a wedge between them since late 2015.

After hundreds of thousands of refugees arrived in the country in 2015, CSU leader Horst Seehofer called for an Obergrenze (upper limit) on the number of asylum seekers that come to Germany each year. Merkel consistently rejected the demand, saying that the right to asylum was non-negotiable.
But after both parties leaked around a million votes to the far-right Alternative to Germany at the national election in September, both seem to have decided it is time for a rethink.
Sunday's deal sets out a cap on the number of refugee arrivals at 200,000 in a year - exactly the number Seehofer has been calling for for the past two years.
But the escapist element comes in the fact that they have avoided using the word Obergrenze, and instead talked of a cap.
Crucially the agreement also allows for the cap to be broken in exceptional circumstances. International and national developments might mean that the government has to adjust the cap ""up or down"", but it will do so in consultation with the parliament, the agreement states.
And the escapism seems to have worked, at least inside the two parties. CDU leaders have praised it for ensuring that it did not impinge on the absolute right to asylum, while the CSU have proclaimed it as the introduction of an upper limit and described themselves as ""very satisfied.""

'Inhumane haggling'
But, while trickery with words may have helped Merkel come to an agreement with the CSU, she also has to coax the Green Party and the Free Democrats (FDP) into a coalition. And leaning towards the CSU's demands on refugees could have just made this considerably harder.
The Green Party have unequivocally rejected the Obergrenze, while the FDP have also said that Germany cannot make compromises on the absolute right to asylum.
Simone Peter, the chairwoman of the Green Party, said on Monday that the cap on refugee numbers was an Obergrenze in all but name.
“Where is the difference to an upper limit? This number is completely arbitrary, it has been set through ideology. We believe in a basic right to asylum,” she tweeted.
She also pointed out in an interview with broadcaster WDR that the Merkel-Seehofer agreement contained further elements which the Green Party reject, such as the creation of asylum centres and the expansion of the safe countries of origin.
In the agreement, Merkel and Seehofer committed to setting up asylum centres to which refugees would immediately be sent when they arrive in the country. Refugees would live in these centres until the applications are dealt with. If they are rejected, the person would be sent directly home from the centre.
The agreement also states that the number of countries Germany considers “safe countries of origin” should be extended to include Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.
“We won’t let ourselves become a plaything of the Christian Union on the humanitarian question of asylum,” Peter said.
“We’ll go into coalition talks and we’ll make our concerns clear. Either it’ll work out or it won’t. Both options are possible.”
The agreement was also sharply criticized by refugee association Pro Asyl, which claimed it was ”a contravention of European human rights law.”
“This is inhumane haggling that is being presented to the public as a solution when in fact it is illegal and comes at the cost of those who need protection,” said ProAyl head Günter Burkhardt.
ProAyl are influential opinion makers among Green voters. While the CDU might be able to sell the agreement to their voters as a victory against the Obergrenze, the Green party won't find it so easy.

					11:19 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Berlin fires refugee home firm after jokes about killing kids,"The emails published by Berlin media reveal that refugee home managers pondered setting up a ""child guillotine"" and giving certain jobs to the ""maximally pigmented"".
Berlin tabloid newspaper BZ published at the weekend emails from senior figures in the refugee housing management firm PeWoBe, revealing the internal emails of the private company.
In one email, several company bosses were discussing what to do with a €5,000 donation from BMW. The director of a refugee home in the eastern Hellersdorf area, Peggy M., wrote to management saying that a proposed sandbox for children would “very quickly become a big ashtray or a local toilet”.
“What about if we instead have a small child-guillotine? Or perhaps a basketball hoop,” she continued. BZ previously reported that Peggy M. had once been an unsuccessful political candidate for a far-right group in Brandenburg.
In response to the guillotine comment, others contributed by sending around pictures of guillotines with beheaded people and a children's slide with a barbed cheese-grater at the end. Peggy M. responded with: “OHHHHH how nice!!!”
PeWoBe's managing director Birgit B. wrote: “I personally find the guillotine to be a totally good suggestion - it will however bring us back into the press and we don't want that”.
Later, Peggy M. complained about the mess that would be caused by the beheadings.
“You of course are right that no one wants to clean up the mess; I at least would not,” responded Birgit B. “In principle that would be a nice job for the maximally pigmented.”
The firm's leaders continued to go back and forth about what to do about disposing of the bodies, including using a ""large-volume crematorium"".
The firm's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser told BZ that the statements were taken out of context and were not serious. He also said that the use of the word guillotine had initially been a mistake due to smartphone autocorrect functions.
Berlin's minister for social affairs Mario Czaja said immediately following the publication of the emails that he was “appalled” and on Sunday announced that he had cancelled all of the firm's contracts without notice, according to Tagesspiegel.
“We have received information about several homes where there are deficiencies,” Czaja said.
“The deficiencies were not fully rectified even after repeated inspections… This is not a model for a company that we would want to continue to work with.”
The city must now find another firm to operate the total of nine refugee homes and some residents may have to relocate, Tagespiegel reported."

					11:26 CEST+02:00				",DPA/The Local,"German parliament passes tougher rules for asylum, deportations","The German parliament on Thursday night passed a controversial package of stricter rules for asylum seekers, including allowing immigration officials to analyze refugees’ cell phone data.
The Bundestag (German parliament) passed the controversial package on asylum rules, which human rights organizations and opposition parties called an assault on fundamental rights for those seeking protection.
The German government in recent months has brought forward a number of new rules to make deportations easier. Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière defended the new package, and said it would be the “conclusion of sharpening asylum laws for this legislative period.”
Under the law, asylum seekers who do not receive permission to stay in the country and do not leave Germany voluntarily, as well as those who give false information about their identities, will be limited in their freedom of movement. Those deemed to have a small chance of being granted permission to stay may be obligated to remain inside their immigration facility until the end of their asylum process.
The maximum amount of time someone can spend in detention pending deportation was extended from four to ten days. For those considered to be potentially dangerous who are supposed to be deported, their detention will also be extended, and they will be monitored through electronic ankle bracelets.
This measure is in direct reaction to the Berlin terror attack in December. The perpetrator, Anis Amri, had his asylum application rejected, and authorities had also considered him to be potentially dangerous, but officials failed to get official documents from Tunisia to deport him until after the attack.
One of the most controversial measures under the package gives the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) the ability to analyze the cellphone data of asylum seekers who do not have identification papers. This is supposed to help officials clarify their identities.
BAMF would also be allowed to pass on sensitive data from asylum processes - such as medical reports - to other agencies in situations deemed particularly dangerous.
These reforms pertaining to refugees' personal information and cellphones have come under fire in particular. The president of Catholic charity Caritas, Peter Neher, admonished the law for being excessive and one-sided. Neher further said that it placed refugees under general suspicion of identity deception. The Church had previously voiced its misgivings about the measures.
Refugee advocacy group Pro Asyl said that the law transforms Germany into a country that deports rather than takes in refugees. They said that through the “mass reading of cellphone data”, the government wants to create “transparent refugees”.
Amnesty International called the reform a massive infringement upon fundamental rights.
Social welfare organization AWO criticized how the toughening of laws makes those seeking refuge in Germany ever more disenfranchised.
Die Linke (Left Party) interior affairs politician Ulla Jelpke declared the law to be a “mishmash of refugee-hostile smut”. Jelpke further called it “despicable” and disgraceful.
Green party politician Volker Beck said that the scheme was just a ‘flashbang grenade’ to distract from the failures in the Amri case.
But the coalition government parties of the CDU and SPD defended the law. De Maizière (CDU) said that those who do not gain protection status need toughness and to be returned to their home country. This is especially so for “those who deceive, trick and commit crimes”.
“In a nation of law, we cannot tolerate asylum seekers being able to claim different names and nationalities, and not give us any useful information, largely without penalty and as they please, and then hope if they are rejected for asylum, the deportation process fails when trying to obtain replacement passports.”
Stricter limits on bringing over family members
Publishing group Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) reported on Friday that in recent months, the German government has been significantly limiting the number of family members allowed to be brought over to Germany through relatives already in the country.
Since April, Germany has taken in only a maximum of 70 family members of refugees per month, according to a government response to a parliamentary inquiry from Die Linke seen by RND. There should in fact be up to 400 people coming per month, according to the report.
Jelpke accused de Maizière of violating the European Union’s Dublin regulations, which state that refugees have the legal right to family reunification.
“Again the German government is trampling on EU rights and child welfare,” Jelpke said.
The Interior Ministry said the reason for the tighter numbers is the “limited care and accommodation capacity” as well as the “significant logistical coordination efforts of state and federal agencies”.
Jelpke said that this was a “pathetic excuse”, and called on the government to lift the cap on family members.

P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } Starting at about 6am, without police present, a group of refugees began tearing down their shacks and tents on Oranienplatz in the Kreuzberg area of the city. The makeshift homes were then carted away by bulldozers and city workers. The structures were part of a protest camp set up in 2012 by a group of asylum seekers who marched from Bavaria in a protest for better refugee rights. Those demolishing the camp explained that authorities had offered them accommodation and a suspension of deportation in exchange for their cooperation. Most had arrived in Lampedusa from Libya, but came to Germany after facing joblessness and discrimination in Italy. They proudly showed their keys and were adamant that they would stay in Germany. Bashir Zakariya Youssef, who originates from Nigeria, said he has lived in the camp for the past year. ""All the deportations were suspended. They will give us a place to stay... we are asking for permits to work,"" he told The Local. ""They've offered us education. We have a lot of people who want to start their lives."" But other residents of the camp were not convinced. They were sceptical about the government's offer and rejected the authority of other migrants to make decisions on their behalf. Ibrahim, who came to Germany from Niger, opposed the demolition. He said it was mostly the work of Nigerian refugees, some of whom did not even live in the camp. ""There are people here who have accepted, but not everyone... [the Nigerians] have accepted the contract, and now they say we all have to leave,"" he explained. He was determined to resist. ""Break what you want to break, but no one is touching my house,"" he said. CLICK HERE to see pictures taken at the the camp on Tuesday Clashes lead to police intervention Residents opposing the demolition were eventually joined by a large group of activists, including Hakan Tas, a member of the Left's faction in the Berlin city senate. He explained that the conflict arose from the different status of the refugees living in the camp.
""There are two groups. The so-called Lampedusa refugees, who already have official status in another EU country... and a group who have already had their applications rejected in another German state,"" he told The Local.. While the agreement meant the first group would automatically profit from a six-month extension of their stay, the others could still be deported on an individual basis. The Lampedusa refugees continued their demolition work throughout the early afternoon. Arguments and short scuffles broke out between them and the other refugees and activists. ""Let the police do it, not you!"" one man shouted. Some of the Nigerian migrants were upset at the presence of the activists, who they felt were denying them a opportunity to move into better housing. ""Give us a chance not to be sleeping like animals... we are sleeping with rats here,"" Bashir said. He even accused the activists of stealing money donated to the refugees, and challenged them to sleep in the camp with him. An activist responded that they were concerned that the authorities were trying to split the migrants up, and would still deport all of them after six months. ""I will be in Germany for my whole life!"" Bashir shouted back. At around 2pm activists remained on the scene to protect the few remaining shacks, making human chains and organizing a sit-in. Riot police arrived shortly after and broke up the demonstration, dragging protesters away. By 3:30pm police had cleared everyone from the square. Activists have announced a demonstration leaving from Kotbusser Tor in Kreuzberg at 8pm. SEE ALSO: 'Black people ban' at Berlin pub ignites tension"

The Max-Bahr Market in Bergedorf in southeast Hamburg has been used as refugee accommodation for less than a week, but has already seen a hunger strike and now a mass brawl.
When 600 refugees moved into the empty market hall on September 27th, there was not a single bed in the building, the Hamburg Morgenpost (MOPO) reported at the time.
Around 100 refugees sat on the footpath outside the building as a mark of protest, with some complaining that the building had not been cleaned.
Parents were angry that there was no separate area designated for them to stay with their children.
Within hours around 100 people had gone on hunger strike, protesting against the poor conditions. Among them was a pregnant woman.
On Sunday there was already sign of tensions developing when police reporting scuffles between 25 refugees, resulting in two men being slightly injured.
In Wednesday night's violence, 200 refugees were involved in the fight, which according to one witness broke out after a disagreement over use of the shower facilities.
Representatives of the fire services told MOPO that some of those involved used iron bars ripped from beds, as Afghan and Syrian refugees fought against each other.
Around 50 police vehicles rushed to the centre to bring the situation under control.
This latest escalation is part of a pattern of violence breaking out at refugee accommodations in recent days.
On Monday in Baden-Württemberg, a large police presence managed to calm an argument between residents of a centre from several different nationalities.
Meanwhile on Sunday in Hesse, a fight between 300 Albanians and 70 Pakistanis led to 14 injuries at a food hall."

					16:22 CET+01:00				", The Local,Head of far-right AfD ‘mistakenly’ votes for refugees to bring families to Germany,"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) rode a wave of anger at the government’s refugee policy to land itself 90 seats in parliament. But apparently they haven’t quite mastered the Bundestag’s voting system yet.
Throughout campaigning for the national election last year the AfD positioned itself as the anti-refugee party. They spoke out for deporting rejected asylum seekers, closing Germany’s border and were against refugees offered subsidiary protection from being able to reunite with their families.
So naturally, when the Bundestag came to vote on family reunifications for people with subsidiary protection on Thursday, the whole AfD voted against a government bill which would allow for a small number of reunifications starting in August.
The AfD instead put forward their own bill which proposed that family reunifications should be completely abolished for people with subsidiary protection, many of whom are Syrians.
Strangely though, there appeared to be a rebel among the AfD’s number, none other than their own parliamentary manager, Bernd Baumann.
Baumann voted for the government bill, which continued a moratorium on family reunifications until the end of July. But the bill, which passed by a margin of 376 against 298, also stated that as of August, 1,000 direct relatives of refugees with subsidiary protection would be able to come to Germany each month.
On Friday the AfD told Spiegel that Baumann had not in fact had a Damascene conversion (no pun intended) but had made a mistake.
“The mistaken way in which he voted naturally does not reflect his political opinion,” AfD spokesman Christian Lüth said.
Allowing refugees to bring their families to Germany has been a point of contention in both rounds of coalition talks since the September election. The Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) are dead against allowing for direct family to join loved ones in Germany, despite research showing that it would not lead to a sharp rise in new refugee arrivals.
Had Baumann’s unusual vote been intentional, he would not have been the first AfD politician to have a dramatic change of heart. A local politician for the far-right party made headlines in January when he quit the state executive board after deciding to convert to Islam."

					11:20 CET+01:00				", The Local,Police accused of 'half truths' on refugee 'hunt' in Bautzen,"Police in a small east German town synonymous with right-wing extremism have been condemned for apparently playing down an incident in which two refugees were chased by a gang of extremists through the streets.
The exact details of what happened in Bautzen, a town of 40,000 in Saxony, on Tuesday night is still hazy.
Shortly before midnight, national newspaper Die Zeit published an article claiming that 40 to 50 right-wing extremists hunted down two refugees in the town. One of the refugees was reportedly yanked from his bicycle and then had a rock thrown at him. Both were eventually able to get away.
Die Zeit further claimed that police only intervened when the group started chasing the refugees. Officers then took one of the victims with them.
A police spokesman then told Die Zeit ""nothing special"" had occurred on Tuesday evening.
But on Wednesday morning police denied that a ""hunt"" had occurred the night before, saying that a group of around ten to 15 people had thrown stones at two asylum seekers.
The police account stated that a 20-year-old asylum seeker, accompanied by two other asylum seekers, had physically attacked a German teen. After police had taken the 20-year-old into custody, the two other refugees were followed by a group who seemed to throw rocks at them, hitting one in the leg. When the group saw the police, they fled, according to the police account.
Officers arrested four suspects, some of whom were already known to authorities. A police spokesman told Tagesspiegel that they “could not rule out” that at least some of the group belonged to the far right-wing scene.
But later on Wednesday the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) also reported an eyewitness account describing between 40 and 50 people who had “hunted down” the two asylum seekers. The group were reportedly wearing dark clothing with right-wing extremist symbols. Some of their vehicles had slogans like “White Power” written on them and they were chanting “get out” to the young men, according to SZ.
Tagesspiegel also reported that groups have popped up in the town calling themselves ""Citizens Movement Bautzen"" (Bürgerbewegung Bautzen) and ""National Front Bautzen"". Citizens Movement Bautzen posted on Facebook on Monday a warning to locals, saying, ""Warning! The migrants are planning something... police have been informed... Please all with children stay away from the centre.""
Police called the message ""highly speculative"", saying it had been based on rumours.
Local Die Linke (Left Party) politician Juliane Nagel was critical of police to Tagesspiegel on Wednesday.
""When it's confirmed that refugees were hunted, threatened and attacked, that is of course an 'exceptional situation', contrary to the depiction by police,"" Nagel said.
""Racism is not normal, and Saxony must also finally learn this.""
Sebastian Striegel, a Green Party member in the state parliament in Saxony-Anhalt, tweeted: ""If we didn't have researched journalism, we would have to believe what the police told us about Bautzen. At most that would be half of the truth.""
Gäbe es keine recherchierenden Journalisten, wir müssten zu #Bautzen glauben, was uns #Polizei erzählt. Das wäre maximal die halbe Wahrheit.

More instances of threats against refugees
In a night of trouble, police recorded two other threatening incidents against refugees on Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning.
Five friends - three young refugees and two Germans - had gone to the central Kornmarkt area in the town. According to witnesses, they were threatened by a group of about eight men, two of whom aimed what appeared to be guns at the refugees. Witnesses said the larger group was made up of people from the far-right scene.
Police said that they then launched an “extensive search” and identified numerous people, but said there were “no known concrete suspects”.
A 39-year-old asylum seeker later told police that someone had threatened him with what appeared to be a gun. Police were able to identify and search the suspect, who had a non-lethal gun as well as cannabis and methamphetamines.
Police have increased their presence in the town of roughly 40,000 since tensions between far-right groups and asylum seekers escalated in September. Some 80 locals from the far-right scene and 20 refugees faced off at the Kornmarkt on September 14th, resulting in physical fights and injuries.
At one point members of the far-right group attacked an ambulance that was supposed to transport a young refugee to hospital.
Police controversies
The police in Saxony have been involved in several controversial episodes over recent months, as critics have accused them of being too close to far-right movements.
In March Saxony's own deputy minister-president said “I ask myself if sympathies for Pegida and the AfD [Alternative for Germany] are more widespread in the police than among normal citizens.”
At Unity Day celebrations in Dresden at the start of October, a police officer wished demonstrators for the xenophobic Pegida movement ""a successful day"", leading to accusations of implicit support.
In February a disturbing video emerged of officers dragging a terrified refugee from a bus in the Saxon town of Clausnitz while a mob of anti-refugees demonstrators blocked the vehicle.
The justice system in the eastern state has also been involved in a scandal, after an alleged Isis terrorist apparently committed suicide while in the care in a jail in Leipzig."
