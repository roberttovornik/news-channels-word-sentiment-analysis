					08:22 CEST+02:00				",AFP,France joins Italy's criticism of NGO migrant rescue ships,"How to save lives without becoming ""taxi services"" for people smugglers? Charity-run rescue boats operating in the Mediterranean face a dilemma and their activity is being increasingly criticized by politicians in Europe.
Humanitarian groups have been operating rescue ships in the sea between war-torn Libya and Italy for several years, plucking tens of thousands of migrants from dangerously overcrowded and ill-equipped boats, sometimes from the sea itself.
Organizations such as France's SOS Mediterranee, Germany's Mission Lifeline or Spain's Proactiva Open Arms are driven by a logic of saving lives: without them, even more people would have perished than the roughly 1,000 already dead or missing in the Mediterranean this year.
But French President Emmanuel Macron has now added his voice to critics who see the NGOs as helping the violent gangs that make millions offering mostly African migrants a passage to Europe. He said on Tuesday that Mission Lifeline had defied ""all the rules"" when it took migrants onto its boat last week when the Libyan coastguard was already intervening.
""We cannot permanently accept this situation,"" he warned in comments in Rome, adding: ""In the end we are playing into the hands of smugglers by reducing the risks of the journey.""
The Lifeline boat, with 233 migrants on board, has been in limbo for days in the Mediterranean as a result of a new policy from Italy's new populist government which has been preventing rescue boats from docking in its ports. The arrival of nearly 700,000 people by boat since 2013 partly explains the rise to power of the anti-immigrant League and populist Five Star Movement, with the decision to block ports backed by a majority of Italians.

Concerns about the charities were voiced by the EU border agency Frontex in a confidential 2016 report, which said they used powerful lights at night on their vessels which acted ""as a beam for the migrants"". Since then, politicians in Italy as well as far-right figures across Europe have regularly questioned rescue missions next to, or sometimes inside, Libyan territorial waters.
Italy's new far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has said the country ""cannot be Europe's refugee camp"" and has accused the charity-run boats of operating like a ""taxi service"" for smugglers and migrants.
Philippe de Botton, head of Medecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) in France, told AFP that NGOs were being unfairly targeted.
""We have a humanitarian mission to help migrants but we are absolutely not helping traffickers,"" he said. ""What helps traffickers is criminalizing rescue operations at sea or closing borders.
""If we allowed people in before studying their cases [asylum requests], as it should be, then we would smash the business model of the traffickers,"" he added.

Mission Lifeline also defended itself from Macron's accusations on Tuesday, saying that it had not broken ""all the rules"", only one: it had refused, like other charities, to hand over migrants to the Libyan coastguard.
The Libyan coastguard is widely suspected of abuses and migrants who are returned to the lawless and violence-wracked north African country face further violence, charities say.
Handing over the migrants to the Libyan coastguard – which is funded by the EU – would have ""contravened the Geneva convention on refugees and been against the law,"" Mission Lifeline said.
In March, Proactiva Open Arms had a boat impounded on the Italian island of Sicily after being accused of complicity in people-smuggling for refusing to hand over rescued migrants to the Libyan coast guard. But an Italian judge later backed the charity, saying that the fundamental rights of migrants could not be guaranteed in Libya.

Soumaila Sacko, 29 and from Mali, was killed on Saturday night in a shooting that also injured two other migrants who, like him, lived in the tent city of San Ferdinando in Reggio Calabria, a sprawling encampment in that houses hundreds of poorly paid people who pick the southern region's crops.
According to Drame Madiheri, a fellow Malian who was shot in the leg, the three men had gone to an abandoned factory nearby to collect sheet metal to build shacks. They had picked up three sheets, he said, when a white man drove up and fired on them four times with a shotgun, hitting Sacko in the head.

Sacko, who like his companions was in Italy legally, was taken to hospital but did not survive. He had lived here since 2010 and joined efforts to secure more rights for migrant workers, according to the USB grass-roots trade union, which helps represent the thousands of foreign labourers employed in southern Italian agriculture.
The USB called a strike on Monday in protest at Sacko's death, which it noted came hours after Matteo Salvini of the anti-immigration League party was sworn in as Italy's interior minister and deputy prime minister.
""The good times for illegals are over,"" Salvini had declared earlier on the day of the shooting, during a visit to a migrant centre in Sicily where he said: ""Italy and Sicily cannot be Europe's refugee camp"".

While police are reportedly not treating the shooting as a hate crime, local activists speculated that it was racially motivated.
""Soumaila is dead because someone around here decided he should be. Here it's not only the mafia, cancer or lack of health care that kills you, racism does too,"" said Father Roberto Meduri, a priest who campaigns for migrants' rights.
The USB plans to hold nationwide demonstrations on June 16th to highlight the conditions faced by Italy's migrant workers. On Sunday residents of the San Ferdinando camp protested by setting fires, which firefighters put out without injury.
The shantytown sprang up after three labourers were shot with an air rifle in January 2010, triggering clashes between locals, migrants and police and prompting hundreds of foreign workers to flee the town proper.
According to the Italian aid group Doctors for Human Rights (Medu), as many as 3,000 labourers – the majority of them with valid residence permits for Italy – live in or around the camp at the height of the harvest, working for minimal wages and sleeping without electricity or running water in conditions that the NGO describes as “shamefully inhumane"". It calls the tent city ""one of the biggest ghettoes in Italy"".

					14:24 CEST+02:00				",AFP,'Irresponsible': France blasts Italy but defends not taking in stranded migrant ship,"French president Emmanuel Macron blasted Italy as ""cynical and irresponsible"" for refusing to offer safe harbour to the stranded migrant ship Aquarius, while the French government defended its own decision not to allow the ship to dock.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accused Italy of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" over its refusal to take in hundreds of migrants stranded on a rescue ship in the Mediterranean, a government spokesman said.
Macron told a cabinet meeting that under maritime law, ""in cases of distress, those with the closest coastline have a responsibility to respond,"" spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said.
Earlier on Tuesday the French government defended its decision not to offer safe harbour to the stranded migrant ship Aquarius after local leaders on Corsica proposed opening one of their ports to the vessel.
Corsican leaders Gilles Simeoni and Jean-Guy Talamoni, the top politicians on the French Mediterranean island, tweeted their offer on Tuesday morning as uncertainty grew over the fate of the 629 people on board the ship.
But the central government in Paris criticised the gesture by the Corsican nationalists.
""[Simeoni] is taking a position without having any responsibility which is easy,"" junior Europe and foreign affairs minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne told Sud Radio.
""What does international law say? They need to go to the port that is safest and closest. And we can see that Corsica is not the closest or the safest. Given the boat's location, it is between Italy and Malta,"" he added.
Both Italy and fellow EU member Malta have refused to accept the migrants who are now heading for the Spanish port of Valencia after the new Socialist government in Madrid agreed to take them in.
Italy's hardline immigration policy under its new populist government could have knock-on effects in neighbouring France, where President Emmanuel Macron has also tightened immigration laws to crack down on illegal arrivals.
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini -- who is also deputy prime minister -- has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of economic migrants, warning that Italy would not be ""Europe's refugee camp"".
The country has been the main point of entry in Europe for migrants and refugees arriving from Africa in recent years, with 700,000 crossing the Mediterranean since 2013, often from war-wracked Libya.

Italy policy 'sickening'
Any increase in arrivals in France would ring alarm bells for Macron who has worked hard to close down migration routes from Africa amid strong anti-immigration sentiment in France.
But a spokesman for Macron's Republic on the Move party said the Italian government's policy was ""sickening.""
""The position, the line of the Italian government is sickening. It's unacceptable to play politics with human lives which is what is happening at the moment,"" Gabriel Attal told the Public Senat channel.
""I'm a spokesman for the party, not the government, but I can't imagine that France will not play a role in finding a humanitarian solution for this boat,"" he said.
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen called for the boats to ""return where they came from"" and said charities rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean were ""the accomplices of the people-trafficking mafia.""
Eric Ciotti, a prominent hard-right MP from the opposition Republicans party, also called on the government to take a tough line on the Aquarius.
""No French port, not Corsica, not Nice, not Marseille,"" he told CNews.
""Of course we should save lives, naturally it's a priority and Europe must act. But the obvious solution is returning to the Tunisian coast or to the Libyan coast,"" he said.
French charity defiant
The head of the French charity which charters the Aquarius migrant rescue ship said Tuesday that it would continue its operations despite the international standoff over the 629 people currently onboard.
The defiant comments from Sophie Beau, head of the charity SOS Mediterranee, suggest the row over the stranded ship could repeat itself -- not least as migrant attempts to cross the Mediterranean increase in the warm summer months.
Beau told AFP a ""one-off solution"" had been found for the Aquarius after Spain offered to take in its passengers following refusals from the nearest countries, Italy and Malta.
But the charity's missions will continue ""as long as there are people drowning in the Mediterranean, as long as we have the resources, and as long as we are able to act and we are not kicked out of the area,"" she said.
""The rescues will continue and it is crucial that European countries talk amongst themselves to find acceptable solutions"" to bring to shore migrants stranded in the Mediterranean, she said.
Beau said her charity, based in the southern French port city of Marseille, was acting under international law in giving ""assistance to people in distress""."

The San Ferdinando camp in southern Italy couldn't be further from the ""good times"" for migrants, referred to by Italy's new nationalist interior minister Matteo Salvini.
The citrus and kiwi season is over in the agricultural plains of Gioia Tauro, in Calabria, but several hundred African migrants continue to live at the makeshift camp, hoping for a few days of work.
Tensions are running high after Soumaila Sacko, a 29-year-old Malian, was shot in the head on Saturday while he was looking for metal sheets in a disused factory.
Investigators have arrested a relative with ties to one of the factory's owners, but for the victim's comrades, the murder is linked to the rhetoric of Salvini, who just a few hours earlier had proclaimed: ""The good times for illegal immigrants are over, get ready to pack your bags.""
""They think we are animals. They shoot us as if we were animals,"" says one of the camp's residents, while another, a friend of Sacko's, inconsolably cries out in grief.

There is a nauseating stench of rubbish lingering over the camp where hundreds are crammed into small tin huts and old tents covered with plastic sheeting. There's no running water, electricity is pinched from a passing cable, it's stifling hot in summer and biting cold in winter.
In some huts, makeshift shops offer drinks, food, detergent and one larger tent bears a sign saying, ""Church of the African Union"". All over the camp there are traces of the various fires that have ravaged it – the most recent in January ripped through half the tents, killing a 26-year-old Nigerian woman.
Living legally
In Italy, this slum and others which have sprung up near the tomato fields in the southern region of Puglia have become symbols of lawlessness, grim wastelands where so many migrants have wound up.
And yet, in San Ferdinando, more than 90 percent of the workers are living legally in Italy – asylum seekers or with residency permits – according to the human rights association Medu, which runs a clinic during high season.
Around 75 percent of them are employed without a contract and all are paid depending on what they collect: 50 cents for a crate of oranges, one euro for a crate of mandarins.

The vast majority have been in Italy for less than three years, but some have lived there much longer, like Johnson, a Liberian who everyone calls ""Prince"".
""I've been in Italy for 17 years. I worked for eight as a mason in the north, and then I lost my job so I ended up here,"" he says. Johnson is one of the luckier ones – he lives in a new camp comprised of large blue tents, set up in 2017 by the authorities.
Standing just 200 metres from the old shantytown, the camp offers running water and electricity, toilets, showers, a mosque, Italian classes and even recycling.
Mafia heartland
""We try to make the reception as dignified as possible,"" says recently laid-off dock worker Dario Nasso, who is involved in the cooperative that runs the new facilities.
But the camp's 560 places were quickly filled. The old slum endures and so do its tensions.
Following Sacko's murder, Michele Di Bari, a top regional official came to meet with a delegation from the camp.
""In tragic situations, there can be tension and we must defuse it, but we must not lose sight of the aim: to close the camp,"" he said during the meeting at the San Ferdinando town hall.
Aboubakar Soumahoro, a representative for the USB Union where Sacko was an activist, urged change: ""We are exploited and no one defends us, we are the targets of violence. There has never been any 'good times' for us,"" he said, in a reference to Salvini's anti-migrant rhetoric.

Mamadou Dia, from the Medu NGO said the authorities must do more. ""Why do they insist on setting up these camps in the middle of an industrial zone when there are so many empty houses in the villages' surrounding plains?"" he asked.
But in an area in the grips of the powerful Calabrian Ndrangheta mob – the San Ferdinando municipal council has already been dissolved several times for mafia infiltration – the inhabitants tend to look the other way.
Yet Sacko's death may serve as an impetus for change. After three days of silence from Italy's new government, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte paid tribute to the slain Malian on Tuesday during his first public speech.
""Our heartfelt thoughts go out Sacko and his family. But this is not enough. Politicians must take responsibility for the tragedy of these people and guarantee them legal working conditions,"" said Conte, eliciting a standing ovation in parliament.

The new rightwing and anti-immigrant Italian government last week banned the French NGO operated vessel the Aquarius, with more than 600 rescued migrants on board, from docking in Italy, causing uproar and a sharp spat with France.
Spain subsequently offered to take the Aquarius and it is expected at the port of Valencia on Sunday.
Salvini showed no sign Saturday of softening his position.
""While the Aquarius is sailing towards Spain, two other Dutch NGO operated vessels (Lifeline and Seefuchs) have arrived off the Libyan coast, to wait for their human cargos once the people smugglers abandon them,"" Salvini said in a Facebook post.
""These people should know that Italy no longer wants to be any part of this business of clandestine immigration and they will have to look for other ports to go to,"" he said.
""As minister and as a father, I take this action for the benefit of all,"" he added.
After Rome's decision to ban the Aquarius, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met on Friday and agreed that the EU should set up asylum processing centres in Africa to prevent ""voyages of death.""
At their meeting in Paris, Macron and Conte also demanded ""profound"" changes to the EU's asylum rules which put the migrant burden on their port of entry to Europe -- mainly Italy and Greece."

""The NGOs will only see Italy on a postcard,"" quipped Salvini, who is also the new deputy prime minister and head of the far-right League party.
""The ports will be closed all summer,"" he said on Italian radio. He added that the ban would concern not only access to ports but also ""the furnishing of fuel to the NGOs.""
""As the Italian military tells me as well as the Libyans, the NGOs help traffickers, consciously or not,"" said Salvini. But he stressed that Italy with other states ""would continue to save all those who need to be saved.""
Salvini's comments come on the day that a European Union summit reached a deal on migration after Italy had threatened to scupper it if its demands for help were not met.
""Foreign NGOs, with foreign crews, flying a foreign flag and financed by foreign institutions will no longer step foot in Italy,"" said Italy's far-right interior minister in the interview with RAI.
A populist government was sworn in this year in Italy, largely in reaction to increased migration flows from North, West and the Horn of Africa in the last five years to the Mediterranean country. Curbing migration is one of the key objectives of the Five Star Movement-La Lega populist coalition government.
""Finally Europe has been forced to accept the argument of Italy's proposal,"" Salvini commented, noting that past Italian governments had been ignored by Brussels. ""Our numerous demands have been accepted. Italy is coming out of its isolation and playing a new role.""
The news comes as 100 people were declared missing by the Libyan coastguard after a boat carrying migrants in the Mediterranean capsized, reports Repubblica. Aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres accused EU authorities of negligence vis-a-vis human life.

“EU member states are abdicating their responsibilities to save lives and deliberately condemning vulnerable people to be trapped in Libya, or die at sea,” said Karline Kleijer, MSF head of emergencies, in a statement on June 29th. “They do this fully aware of the extreme violence and abuses that refugees and migrants suffer in Libya.”
Last week was the deadliest so far this year on the Mediterranean, according to MSF. The organization stated that at least 220 people drowned. ""These were avoidable tragedies,"" adds the statement.
Most EU leaders nevertheless hailed the new deal, the details of which remain unclear, as a breakthrough. ""We will protect better, cooperate more and we reaffirm our principles,"" said French President Macron on Friday morning.

Austria's populist chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, hailed the agreement. ""For the first time we have an accord on refugee centres outside the EU... it's a big step. If we can only ensure that people do not come to Europe we could end trafficking and massively reduce the number of refugees coming into Europe.

guest in the Italian border town of Ventimiglia, a flashpoint in Europe's
migration crisis.
Residents are furious at the French president for charging Rome with ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" this week after it turned away a rescue boat carrying more than 600 asylum-seekers.
""It's bad what happened to the Aquarius (ship) but how dare Macron criticise Italy!"" vented retired teacher Fulvia Semeria who volunteers for the Secours Catholique charity, a key aid group for migrants.
""It's unacceptable from a country that does nothing for migrants and even rejects them,"" she said, calling his remarks ""insulting and totally unfair"".
The pretty northern town at the gates of the French Riviera has received tens of thousands of asylum seekers pushed back by France since the eruption of Europe's worst migration crisis three years ago.
This is in addition to scores of desperate African refugees landing on its shores after undertaking the perilous journey across the Mediterranean.
The influx has seen Ventimiglia dubbed the ""Calais of Italy"", in reference to the French coastal town notorious for its sprawling migrant camps.
Tapping into anger over the arrivals, the far-right League party reaped a record result of 30 percent in March elections here. The score helped catapult the party and its leader Matteo Salvini into a coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.
Semeria laments Rome's rejection of the migrant vessel last weekend -- triggering a diplomatic spat between France and Italy -- but says it may have been a much-needed ""wake-up call for Europe"".
""I have been volunteering here for years and seen so many children and even pregnant women being turned back by France.""
'Italy's fed up'
At least 16 migrants have died trying to cross from France into Italy since September 2016, falling off mountains, being hit by cars or electrocuted while hiding under train carriages.
Every morning, Secours Catholique hands out food, clothes and medicine to hundreds of asylum seekers -- many from Sudan, South Sudan and Eritrea -- in central Ventimiglia.
The struggle to help them increased last summer when police shut a nearby migrant camp, opened by the local church following an appeal from Pope Francis, after receiving complaints from residents.
Instead, some 400 migrants are now hosted at a Red Cross site outside town.
""It's enough, Italy's fed up! Why should it all fall on us?"" exclaimed vendor Giuseppe Piccolo, 60, at Ventimiglia's famed market.
The fresh produce draws many French visitors who travel in the opposite direction of the migrants for their weekly shopping.
""Yes, I've voted for the League, against the migrants,"" Piccolo told AFP.
Fellow vendor Davide Regina, 59, praised Salvini -- now interior minister -- for blocking the Aquarius migrant ship.
""Sadly, Salvini was right to do so. It needs to serve as a lesson because we can't cope here anymore,"" Regina said.
'Out of place'
Under a current bilateral agreement, France can return more than 85 percent of all rejected migrants to Italy.
For now, French officials say that the system continues to work.
However, during a February visit to Ventimiglia on his campaign trail, Salvini vowed to ""do what the French do: control the borders, welcome those who have the right to stay and reject the hundreds of thousands of people who don't have the right to stay in Ventimiglia or the rest of Italy.""
Since entering government, he has reiterated his pledge to clamp down on illegal immigration and already made good to on his promise to turn away boats.
In light of recent developments, the centre-left mayor's office is feeling the heat ahead of regional elections in 2019.
Deputy mayor Silvia Sciandra called Macron's comments ""out of place"", stressing what was really needed was a common EU migrant policy.
""From one day to the next in 2015, we found ourselves with hundreds of people at our train stations,"" she told AFP.
""We are doing what we can to maintain the dignity of migrants and of our citizens who have the right to not see their town turn into a camp.""

The Mare Jonio is a tug flying the Italian flag that left Augusta in Sicily on Wednesday evening, headed south, maritime tracking websites said. The 37-metre vessel – around half the length of the Aquarius – is not intended to rescue migrants and bring them to a safe port, but to spot and secure migrant-carrying boats that are in distress.
It will also provide a civilian presence in an area where they say the Libyan coastguard and international military vessels are failing to rescue people, despite several shipwrecks in September. Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms sent the Astral sailboat to the area on a similar mission a few days ago.
The Astral was off the coast of Lampedusa on Wednesday to commemorate the fifth anniversary of a shipwreck there in which 366 migrants died in 2013. The disaster pushed Italy to launch its Mare Nostrum military operation to rescue migrants making the perilous journey from North Africa to Europe.

Since then European Union and NGO boats have joined in, although most of the aid group boats have now stopped work, some because of what they say are trumped-up administrative charges.
The International Organisation for Migration says that around 15,000 migrants have drowned in the central Mediterranean since the Lampedusa disaster. During the same period Italy has received around 600,000 migrants on its coast, while other European nations have closed their borders.
Italy's former centre-left government tried to stem the flow of migrants by working with the Libyan authorities and limiting the NGO effort. Anti-immigrant Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who came to power as part of a populist government in June, has since then closed Italian ports to civilian and military boats that have rescued migrants, saying Italy bears an unfair share of the migrant burden.

The salvoes follow a fractious EU summit in June which agreed to set up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc to process migrants after Italy's new populist government said it was closing its ports.
""Italy does not want to be the only country where migrants saved at sea by its own naval units disembark,"" Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said in a letter to EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.
The Italian position and its implications will be discussed at a meeting later Friday by member states in Brussels, EU sources said.
Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj meanwhile rejected the EU proposal for asylum processing centres in his country, saying: ""We are strictly against Europe officially placing illegal migrants who are no longer wanted in the EU in our country.""
Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia were also approached by the EU but have already refused to host such centres. ""We also won't agree on any deals with EU money about taking in more illegal migrants,"" the Libyan premier told Germany's Bild newspaper.
Sarraj said European leaders should instead put pressure on migrants' origin countries to stop them embarking on their journey in the first place. Most of the migrants are from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has written to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker saying his country would no longer take in migrants plucked from the Mediterranean until other member states accepted some of them.

Over the last decade, the Italian coastguard has coordinated the rescue of hundreds of thousands of migrants off the coast of Libya, in many cases pulling them from the water themselves in treacherous conditions.
But as of June, they have been ordered to transfer calls for help and reports of boats in distress to the Libyan capital Tripoli.
'Ad hoc solutions won't work'
Juncker wrote back to Conte saying ""these ad hoc solutions will not be feasible in the long term,"" according to a copy of a letter seen by AFP.
But Juncker agreed to try and identify nations that would shelter rescued migrants until a definitive framework was agreed upon as to who would take charge of them.
June was the deadliest month in the Mediterranean in recent years with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reporting some 564 deaths or disappearances, despite the fact that overall departures have dropped sharply since the summer of 2017.
Under a controversial deal with the EU, Libyan coastguards intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean. But the UN has slammed the policy as ""inhuman"", noting that the migrants are simply brought back to ""horrific"" detention centres in Libya.
The European Court of Human Rights also opposes the repatriation of migrants to Libya on the ground that they could face rights abuse.
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will discuss in the coming weeks proposals for controlled holding centres for migrants in member states and cooperation in rescue efforts, spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said earlier this week.

					17:47 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy defiant as migrant ship stranded in Mediterranean,"Italy defiantly declared on Saturday that its ports were closed to foreign-flagged rescue ships as German charity vessel Lifeline lay off the coast of Malta in limbo with more than 230 migrants aboard.
Malta -- which is also refusing to take in the boat in a new diplomatic standoff with Italy -- nevertheless said it had sent in humanitarian supplies.
""The Lifeline, an illegal ship with 239 immigrants on board is in Maltese waters,"" Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Facebook. ""These boats can forget about reaching Italy, I want to stop the business of trafficking and mafia.""
Salvini's tough talk came on the eve of an emergency mini-summit in Brussels to address the divisive issue of how the EU can tackle the renewed influx of migrants and refugees seeking a new life in Europe.
Just three weeks in office, Italy's new populist government is digging its heels in on campaign promises to stop the influx of migrants, threatening to seize rescue ships or barring them from its ports.
The crisis has also caused ructions in Germany, with Chancellor Angela Merkel facing a rebellion from her coalition allies over her policies.
Meanwhile, more than 400 migrants were rescued in three operations off the coast of Spain on Saturday, just days after Madrid took in the more than 600 rejected by Italy and Malta. And the Libyan navy said five people died and nearly 200 were rescued off its coast while trying to cross the Mediterranean.
Threat to seize boats
The Italian government has said both the Lifeline, run by German NGO Mission Lifeline, and another ship Seefuchs, run by another German charity Sea-Eye, -- would be seized and directed to Italian ports for investigation ""into their legal status"".
Rome accuses the Lifeline of having acted in contravention of international law by taking on board migrants while the Libyan coastguard was intervening.
Earlier this month Salvini triggered an EU-wide row when he barred the French charity-run Aquarius rescue ship, carrying 630 migrants, from docking in Italy. Malta also refused to take it in and the ship was later welcomed by Spain.
Salvini said on Friday that Malta should open its ports to the Lifeline, adding: ""Clearly, the boat should immediately be impounded and its crew arrested.""
But Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said the Lifeline ""broke rules"" by ignoring Italy's directions and should move towards its original destination ""to prevent escalation"".
""Despite having no responsibility Malta just provided humanitarian supplies"" while its armed forces carried out the medical evacuation of one passenger, he said.
As the two neighbours squabbled, a Danish cargo ship carrying 113 migrants was stationed near the Sicilian port of Pozzallo waiting for instructions from Italy. The Alexander Maersk changed course after picking up a distress call
Friday, a spokesman for Maersk Line said, without specifying where the migrtants were rescued.
'Awaiting diplomatic solution'
Mission Lifeline denied Italy's accusations regarding the rescue in Libyan waters, saying it was the best equipped vessel to help.
""We are waiting for a diplomatic solution, discussions are underway between different states to host the Lifeline and those rescued,"" the organisation's representative in Germany, Axel Steier, told AFP, adding that 14 women and four children were among those on board.
The issue of migration was thrust to the forefront of the EU agenda after Italy turned away the Aquarius. But the Aquarius defiantly vowed to continue its work and an AFP photographer on board said Saturday that it was currently responding to distress call in Tunisian waters.
EU tensions
Italy's hardline stance comes at a time of deep EU tensions on immigration. Sunday's mini-summit is supposed to prepare for a full summit next week, where 28 EU leaders will discuss plans to overhaul the bloc's asylum system, which has been under severe pressure since the migration crisis exploded in 2015.
Merkel -- facing a ferocious political backlash for letting in over one million asylum seekers into Europe's biggest economy -- played down expectations of a quick solution.
""We know that no solution will be reached on Thursday and Friday at the level of the 28 member states... on the overall issue of migration,"" she said on a visit to Lebanon. Instead, she said, ""bilateral, trilateral and multilateral"" deals must be
reached to tackle the issue.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer warned Monday he would give Merkel a fortnight to find a European deal to curb new arrivals, failing which he vowed to order border police to turn back migrants.
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis also said on Friday he was ready to start turning away migrants if Berlin and Vienna did so.

in distress off Libya docked in Spain on Thursday after roaming the
Mediterranean for days, the third such vessel to be allowed in the country in
two months after Italy refused to take them in.
The white ship belonging to Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms arrived in the southern port of San Roque, just over the bay from Gibraltar, at 9:20am (0720 GMT).
The migrants, nearly all from Sudan including Darfur, had spent 50 hours at sea on board an inflatable boat, without drinking water, and many suffered burns from a mixture of fuel and salt water before they were rescued on August 2nd.
There were 75 men and 12 boys.
The NGO says many of them were ""repeatedly abused in Libya.""
San Roque is where Spain hastily opened a new migrant reception centre as hundreds of migrants make the perilous sea crossing to the southern coast of Andalusia every week.
Faced with a crackdown by Libyan authorities and Italy's hardline approach to the arrival of migrants, Spain has now become the main destination for those trying to get to Europe from Africa.
More than 23,700 people have arrived in Spain by sea so far this year with 307 dying in the attempt, according to the International Organization for Migration -- more than during all of last year.
The country's new Socialist government has also allowed the docking of three NGO rescue ships since June after Italy and Malta refused access.
In June, the French NGO Aquarius ship, which had picked up 630 stranded migrants off Libya, was allowed to dock in Spain's eastern port of Valencia.
Then on July 4, Proactiva Open Arms' ship docked in Barcelona with 60 migrants.
This time round though, the Spanish government has said the 87 migrants who have arrived in San Roque will be treated in the same way as the hundreds who arrive every week on Spanish shores.
When the Aquarius docked, Madrid had given each migrant a 45-day residency permit for humanitarian reasons.
Those brought back to Barcelona had also been given special treatment."

The deal means thousands more of the primarily Sudanese and Eritrean migrants will remain in Israel at least temporarily. It also ends the possibility that many would be forcibly deported to an unnamed African country, widely believed to be Uganda or Rwanda.
A minimum of 16,250 migrants will be resettled in Western nations including Canada, Germany and Italy under the agreement, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""The agreement stipulates that for each migrant who leaves the country, we commit to give temporary residence status to another,"" Netanyahu said in a televised address after Israel announced the deal.
Germany and Italy, however, said they were unaware of any such resettlement deal for African migrants from Israel, although the German interior ministry said Berlin always respected its humanitarian commitments.

Netanyahu in January announced the implementation of a programme to remove migrants who entered illegally, giving them a choice between leaving voluntarily or facing indefinite imprisonment with eventual forced expulsion.
According to interior ministry figures, there are currently some 42,000 African migrants in Israel, half of them children, women or men with families, who were not facing immediate deportation. As the migrants could face danger or imprisonment if returned to their homelands, Israel offered to relocate them to an unnamed African country, which deportees and aid workers said was Rwanda or Uganda.
They had initially been given a deadline of April 1st, but Israel's supreme court suspended the plan on March 15th while it continued to examine it. Israel's statement announcing the new plan on Monday said there was no longer a need to send migrants to unnamed third countries.
Netanyahu said in his remarks on Monday that he had to abandon the earlier plan because the option of sending them to a third country ""no longer exists"". Rwanda and Uganda have said they would not accept those deported against their will.
The earlier plans had drawn sharp criticism from the United Nations refugee agency as well as from some Israelis and rights activists.
'Shame'
The migrants' presence in Israel has become a political issue, with Netanyahu referring to them as ""not refugees but illegal infiltrators"".
Religious and conservative politicians have portrayed the presence of Muslim and Christian Africans as a threat to Israel's Jewish character. A group of residents of southern Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants have settled, immediately denounced the new plan in a statement, calling it ""a shame for the state of Israel.""
Under the new five-year plan, Israel will ""regulate"" the status of those not being resettled -- signalling they will be allowed to stay at least temporarily.

Migrants began entering Israel through what was then a porous Egyptian border in 2007. The border has since been strengthened, all but ending illegal crossings.
Holot, an open facility where inmates were free to leave during the day but had to return at night, was opened in 2013 with the aim of siphoning migrants away from the cities. The facility was closed last month as part of the previous plan.
Some Holot inmates were transferred to the nearby Saharonim prison. Others who had submitted asylum requests before January 1st were released pending a decision. Another 300 had been freed after agreeing to leave Israel, according to Israel's immigration authority.
Those released were barred from living or working in seven cities with high migrant populations, including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the Red Sea resort of Eilat.
Israeli officials had said that no one they classify as a refugee or asylum-seeker would be deported, though the process of granting asylum has been criticised as extremely slow and biased against claims. Only a handful of asylum claims have been approved in recent years.
Those opposed to the original plan included Holocaust survivors who say the country has a special duty to protect migrants.

					09:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,"Italy, Malta in diplomatic spat over migrant arrivals","Italy's new hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini engaged in a war of words with the Maltese government on Friday after accusing the Mediterranean island of not doing its fair share to take in migrants.
""The good God put Malta closer to Africa than Sicily,"" said the nationalist Salvini, as a new wave of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean prepared to land in Italy.
""It is not possible for Malta to say 'no' to any request for help,"" he continued.
Salvini's comments came after Malta reportedly refused to come to the aid of a migrant rescue ship Seefuchs, which was stranded with 119 migrants onboard in the Mediterranean due to violent sea conditions.
The ship had embarked on a mission coordinated by the Italian coastguard on Wednesday to rescue migrants aboard a dinghy in distress.
But after evacuating the dinghy, the Seefuchs was forced to call for assistance from a bigger vessel, unable to navigate in the deteriorating weather conditions without putting the migrants' lives in danger.
According to the German NGO Sea-Watch, which attempted in vain to assist the Seefuchs due to the adverse conditions, Valletta refused to offer assistance, apart from agreeing to accept medical evacuations by air.
The Maltese government was quick to deny it had done anything wrong.
""With regards to Search and Rescue, Malta acts in accordance to the international conventions that apply,"" the government said in a statement on Friday evening.
""Malta will continue to respect these conventions with respect to the Safety of Life at Sea (maritime treaty), as happened in this latest case and indeed in each case.""
70 hours in rough seas
The Seefuchs was finally reached on Friday afternoon by a tanker and an Italian coast guard ship and is expected to dock at the port of Pozzallo in southern Sicily in the evening.
The migrants on board were reportedly in a state of distress after spending 70 hours in rough seas.
Another 232 migrants, on board the NGO ship Sea Watch 3 are also set to disembark in the southern Italian state of Calabria Saturday morning after more than three days at sea.
Unconvinced by Valletta's statement, the bullish Salvini, issued a sharp response on Friday evening.
""Can our Maltese friends tell us how many ships carrying immigrants docked in their ports in 2018?"" he said in a statement.
""How many people landed, how many asylum applications were examined and how many accepted? Italy wants to solve problems, not create them.""
Salvini -- who is also deputy prime minister -- has repeatedly promised to stop migrants arriving in Italy and speed up deportations.
He accuses fellow EU nations of abandoning Italy in the struggle to deal with migrant arrivals, recently announcing that Italy cannot be ""Europe's refugee camp.""
The southern European nation has seen more than 700,000 migrants arrive on their shores since 2013.
However, a controversial agreement between Italy's former centre-left government and authorities and militias in Libya has triggered a decline in overall arrivals of some 75 percent since the summer of 2017.
But so far this year Italian authorities have still registered more than 13,500 arrivals."

No arancini were allowed onto the Diciotti, the Italian coastguard ship that has been docked in Catania since Monday night with around 150 people on board, whom the Italian government has refused permission to disembark.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini argues that those rescued at sea are illegal immigrants, not refugees, and has threatened to have them taken to Libya unless other EU countries offer to take them in.

The arancini demonstration was called to show that some in the local community would like Catania to be an ""open port"" for these and other migrants, according to organizer Silvio Laviano. He described his message as: ""Welcome to Catania! Here, have an arancino.""
Why arancini? The Sicilian speciality represents not only a snack to be eaten while travelling but something to offer hungry visitors, participants said.
""For us in Sicily, food has always been the way you welcome guests,"" one woman explained.
While some 30 minors on board the Diciotti were allowed to disembark on Wednesday night, Salvini has so far resisted calls to allow the rest of the group to land.
""I'm not backing down,"" he insisted on Thursday, calling on the EU to intervene.
The United Nations refugee agency, as well as aid organizations, have expressed concerns over the migrants' continued detention on the ship, a week since they were rescued at sea near the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Pro-migrant protesters have been arriving at Catania port since the Diciotti docked there late on Monday. On Thursday, one group attempted to reach the coastguard ship in a dinghy, but was intercepted by police.

The Aquarius said it had contacted Italy, Malta and Tunisia asking for help. Rome passed on the information to the Libyan coastguard, who asked them to hand over the migrants to one of their patrol vessels.
The crew of the Aquarius responded that they could not legally comply as Libyan ports were not considered places of safety, said SOS Méditerranée, a French NGO.

They are among hundreds of migrants trying their luck in Bardonecchia. The town is a skiers' delight, but beyond the black run thrills and hot toddies lie the tracks of those braving dangerous snowy peaks to cross the border.
After a crackdown at the Ventimiglia coastal crossing, young men have begun arriving at the railway station here to attempt the Col de l'Echelle pass, which runs 16 kilometres (ten miles) between Bardonecchia and the first French town.
While controls along this route are strict in the summer months, it is closed to traffic in winter and rather than zealous police the biggest challenge facing the mainly African men is a freezing wind that buffets the1,700 metre (5,600 feet) high pass.

Inside the station, tired youths wolf down plates of stew and rice handed out by volunteers from the Rainbow for Africa and Briser les Frontieres associations, as well as the Red Cross.
Frostbite fears
Those lucky enough to make it to the French side without getting caught are welcomed by locals offering warm hearths and hearts. The Italians, meanwhile, do everything possible to convince the migrants to turn back before it is too late.
After surviving baking deserts, detention in Libyan prisons and perilous boat crossings in the Mediterranean, the migrants are shown pictures by volunteers of avalanches or fellow travellers who have lost limbs to frostbite.
Many shrug off the danger. ""We have nothing to lose. No job, no money, we are ready to take any necessary risk to cross the border,"" said one young Guinean, who wanted to remain anonymous.
Cyrille Coulibaly, a 20-year-old from Ivory Coast who recently arrived in Italy, had set off before dawn the day before, but quickly turned back, shivering violently in his lightweight clothing. However he refuses to be discouraged.
""I was advised to take this route. It's all planned. I just need to find some shoes,"" he told AFP.
Others, like 29-year-old Mohamed Bambore from Burkina Faso, throw in the towel before even setting out.
""I'm not going to do it. It's dangerous, you could lose a foot (to frostbite),"" he said.
French tourists offer food and water to migrants walking in the snow.
Instead he will wait in Italy for his residence permit to be renewed before looking for another way into France. Cisse and Ibrahim, struggling through snow up to their knees, their jeans soaked through, also turn back.
Dash in the dark
Catching a train would certainly be the easiest way: Bardonecchia is the last Italian stop on the Milan to Paris service, which runs four times a day. As night falls, the migrants put off by the mountain stare at the timetable, planning to sneak on at the next chance.
But reality catches up with them quickly, with seven or eight French border police officers on each train.
""The train is full, get the next bus,"" a conductor tells two young migrants, signalling for them to leave the station.
Italian police officers stand guard at the border.
The whistle blows, the doors close and the train leaves -- almost empty. Most of those who do make it across, by train or on foot, eventually find themselves in a white French police van which serves as a shuttle bus from six in the morning until midnight, returning them to Bardonecchia.
There are warm clothes and hot tea waiting for them at the station, where a little room has been transformed into a dormitory, in which exhausted travellers can bed down for the night under the supervision of a volunteer medic. Dawn brings fresh snowfall and new migrants, who determinedly zip up jackets, wrap scarves around their heads and brace for the climb up the menacing slopes.

labourers downed tools and marched from fields in southern Italy chanting ""we are not slaves"" Wednesday, protesting conditions for tomato pickers after 16 migrant workers died in two road crashes.
The near-identical accidents within 48 hours of each other have highlighted the plight of farm workers around the the city of Foggia in the Puglia region, where thousands of foreign nationals spend the summer season harvesting tomatoes, often at the mercy of day labourer recruiters sometimes linked to organised crime.
Striking demonstrators shouted ""we are not slaves, no to exploitation"" as they made their way from the countryside towards Foggia.
Italy's government has scrambled to respond to the outcry over the deaths, with hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini declaring war on the ""mafia"" in and around Foggia and promising to eradicate it ""street by street, town by town"", during a visit to the region on Tuesday.
Both the road crashes in the region happened when lorries transporting tomatoes slammed into vans carrying foreign farm workers returning from their day's work.
An accident on Saturday left four African farm workers dead and four others seriously injured, while Monday's smash killed 12 people, all non-EU citizens.
The Foggia province hosts thousands of Africans who spend the summer harvesting season picking tomatoes in blazing temperatures alongside workers from eastern Europe, typically Romanians, Bulgarians and Poles.
Although most of those working in the fields in Italy have regular papers, they rarely receive the benefits and salaries required by law, and many live in squalid conditions.
They are often beholden to the recruiters, who operate as intermediaries and collect a portion of the workers' pay.
For years, unions and associations that help migrant workers have called for a public transport system to be created around Foggia for the peak harvest season.
The Puglia region has now budgeted for such a system, governor Michele Emiliano said on Monday, but he added that cooperation and transparency from the farms was crucial.

French authorities confirmed on Monday evening that a gendarme van had crossed the border during an operation to deport undocumented migrants. Officers alerted a police station on the Italian side, according to the Hautes-Alpes prefecture, but the vehicle was not supposed to enter Italy.
The gendarmes involved were new to the post and unfamiliar with the area, the French department's prefect Cécile Bigot-Dekeyzer told Le Dauphine, putting the incident down to ""an error on the part of the officers"".

The explanation failed to satisfy Italy's government, with anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini demanding ""clear, swift and unequivocal answers"" from Paris.
""I don't want to believe that [Emmanuel] Macron's France would use its own police to secretly unload immigrants in Italy,"" said Salvini, one of the French president's most vocal critics. ""But if anyone seriously thinks they can use us as Europe's refugee camp, violating laws, borders and agreements, they are sorely mistaken.""
It's not the first time the Alpine border has caused tension between France and Italy: in April, Rome summoned the French ambassador to complain after French customs officers crossed the border and confronted an Italian resident they suspected of carrying drugs at the train station of Bardonecchia.
The same month saw heated protests on both sides of the border by pro- and anti-migrant groups, prompting both countries to send police reinforcements to the mountain area.

					09:51 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italian coastguard staff break silence to express concern over government migrant policy,"The decision by Italy's new populist government to close the country's ports to migrants saved at sea is causing unease within the heart of the Italian coastguard, some staff say, who until recently played a key role in rescue missions.
Over the last decade the coastguard has coordinated the rescue of hundreds of thousands of migrants off the coast of Libya, in many cases pulling them from the water themselves in treacherous conditions.
But as of June, they have been ordered to transfer calls for help and reports of boats in distress to the Libyan capital Tripoli.
Now -- despite a culture of traditionally not criticizing government policy -- a handful of coastguard staff have spoken out.
In an interview with Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore last week, a coastguard admiral criticized the government and in particular the nationalist interior minister Matteo Salvini's new hardline stance.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the admiral recalled that the Italian justice system had deemed Libya was not a ""safe place"" for rescued people to returned to. Many migrants trying to reach Europe are desperate not to go back to Libya as they potentially face abuse and rape in detention centres.
The admiral also denounced the absence of an official decree or act regarding the decision to close the country's ports to vessels carrying migrants. In recent weeks the policy has left the coastguard powerless as several ships with rescued migrants aboard spent days stranded in the Mediterranean unable to dock in Italy.

On Wednesday, at an event marking the 153rd anniversary of the Italian Coastguard, admiral Giovanni Pettorino, coastguard commander, evoked the memory of Salvatore Todaro, a submariner who during WW2 took serious risks to rescue the survivors of a ship he had just sunk.
""In times of war, these things are not done,"" a German admiral is said to have told Todaro at the time.
The coastguard commander concluded his speech given before Italy's new political authorities, by recalling Todaro's response: ""We are Italian sailors. We have 2000 years of civility behind us and we do these things.""
Speaking anonymously to Catholic daily Avvenire and Radio Radicale, some coastguard officers said the priority to rescue those in danger was demonstrated earlier this month. On July 13th the coastguard was sent to keep watch on 450 migrants crammed into a fishing boat, but took part in a later rescue mission even though Rome had told them to let Malta take charge, the officers said.
Recalling the decision to intervene, the officers spoke of their ""feeling of helplessness"" which had built up in the weeks prior, as migrants attempted the perilous sea crossing.
The vast majority of Italy's around 13,000 coastguard officers work along the country's 8,000 km of coastline, but the institution says that more than 2,000 of them have had first-hand experience on vessels operating off Libya -- where a large number of the migrant tragedies occur.
""At the moment, the atmosphere among the coastguard corps is not the best,"" says Sergio Scandura, a journalist with Radio Radicale.

The month of June was the deadliest in the Mediterranean in recent years with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reporting some 564 deaths or disappearances, despite the fact that overall departures have dropped sharply since the summer of 2017.
Salvini's hardline immigration stance appears, however, to be very popular among Italians: according to about half a dozen separate polls, some two-thirds of citizens approve his decision to close ports to rescued migrants.
His far-right League party -- which governs the country as part of a coalition -- has also experienced a boom in the polls: the League garnered 17 percent of the vote at the March general election, but opinion polls now suggest support of around 30 percent.
The new policy has come under fire from the country's opposition politicians, however, and some of Italy's prominent Catholic figures have also spoken out.
After two bodies were discovered in a deflated dinghy off Libya, along with one survivor suffering from shock and hypothermia on Tuesday, the Episcopal Conference of Italy released a statement denouncing a ""tragedy which we cannot manage to get used to"".
""We warn unequivocally that to save our humanity from vulgarity and barbarism, we must protect life. Every life. From the most exposed, humiliated and trampled,"" the bishops wrote.

					09:10 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Anger over Italian government's 'war' on model migrant town,"Anger in Italy grew Sunday over an interior ministry order to transfer all migrants out of a town at the centre of a national debate on the integration of asylum-seekers.
The ministry has said all migrants must leave the Calabrian town of Riace in southern Italy following the arrest of its mayor Domenico Lucano earlier this month for allegedly fiddling the system to benefit refugees.
Sources at the ministry were later quoted by Italian media outlets to have rowed back on the forced transfers, saying the migrants would ""only be moved on a voluntary basis"". Those electing to remain, however, would no longer ""benefit from the reception system"".
The town -- whose population had been dwindling for decades -- made headlines around the world by welcoming migrants in an attempt to revitalise itself.
Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, however, has said he wants to reduce projects inspired by Riace and group asylum-seekers in large centres.
""For shame. This is not Italy!"" former prime minister Enrico Letta said on Twitter, reacting to the decision. ""Stop Salvini. Don't look the other way,"" added the National Partisan Association (ANPI).
Salvini and his League party have made Riace an emblem of their ""war on the immigration business"". But following the decision to dismantle the model, around 200 migrants who have made their lives in the sparsely-populated town -- boosting jobs and development -- will be affected, according to Italian media reports.

Critics say the government should instead be waging war on organised crime in Calabria, a heartland of the mafia.
Naples mayor Luigi de Magistris, who worked in Calabria as a prosecutor for nine years, also railed against the government. ""If Lucano is the danger in Calabria, it means the mafia is winning,"" he said.
""If the government decides to deport the oppressed, fragile victims of oppressors from the world's regimes, then Riace must become a stronghold of resistance,"" he added.
Under Lucano's migrant programme, abandoned houses were restored and craft workshops reopened in a model that came to be copied in other ""dying"" hamlets.
He was placed under house arrest at the start of October on charges of involvement in organising ""marriages of convenience"" for asylum purposes, and has also been accused of skipping a tender process to favour co-operatives with ties to migrants.
His lawyers are preparing an appeal against the ministry, which has demanded a breakdown of all expenses.
""Salvini's priorities in Calabria are to send away families and children and dismantle a model of integration that has worked and is known around the world,"" said Laura Boldrini, former parliament speaker.
""It's right for every cent of public money to be accounted for, but how can the head of a party that has stolen €49 million from Italian citizens tell a Calabrian mayor that there can be no irregularities in the public finances?"" she said.
Salvini's party was found this year to have fraudulently claimed €49 million euros in electoral expenses in 2008-2010.

Italy is 'steeped in hate', Amnesty warns amid toxic election campaign
Fear of immigrants – and of a far-right anti-immigrant backlash – has overshadowed election discussions about the economy ahead of the vote on March 4th.
People in Macerata know the conflicting arguments better than most. At the end of January, the body of 18-year-old Pamela Mastropietro was found dismembered in two suitcases near the city.
A Nigerian man was arrested. Days later a far-right activist, Luca Traini, went on a two-hour shooting spree targeting African migrants in Macerata, injuring six.

The happy migrant
The events set off waves of condemnation, protests and counter-protests. Right-wing campaigners used the death of Mastropietro to promote their anti-immigrant message.
Within days, there were two small but headline-grabbing demonstrations from far-right groups in Macerata.
Then thousands of anti-fascists descended on the city.

""It was a bolt from the blue for us, you know? We're not used to this sort of thing,"" says Laura, a mother of six-year old twins, outside her children's school. ""Macerata is a really peaceful city and it's been hard to deal with what happened.""
Madu Cisse, a migrant from Mali, was also surprised. ""I wouldn't have ever expected something like that to happen here,"" he says.
He made the perilous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa in 2011. He moved to Macerata and became a pastry chef. ""I've been in Macerata pretty much since I arrived in Italy and I'm happy here.""
Support for attacker
Protests over large-scale immigration have rocked Italian politics since the beginning of the migrant crisis. More than 690,000 migrants have come to the country by boat since 2013.
But the numbers have been falling. After the EU agreed a controversial deal with Libya to intercept migrants, Italy received 119,000 migrants by sea last year, a third less than in 2016.
‘We're scared of immigration, not Europe,' say Italian voters
The ruling centre-left Democratic Party welcomed that reduction. But immigration remains a hot political issue. Polls indicate it is an important subject for around 30 percent of voters.
Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has pledged to deport 600,000 illegal immigrants if his coalition of Forza Italia and two far-right forces wins power.

""Lots of people say positive things about Traini,"" the gunman who admitted to shooting migrants,"" says one staff member at a local bar in Macerata, who wished to remain anonymous. ""It's very common.""
Giancarlo Giulianelli, the lawyer representing Traini, told AFP he has received an ""alarming"" number of messages in support of his client's actions. He feels those are only ""the tip of the iceberg"".
Anti-immigrant backlash feared
As well as the national election result, eyes will focus on the vote in Macerata to see if far-right parties gain from their pledges to ""fix"" Italy's migration problems.
Macerata has taken in a similar number of migrants to other Italian cities. Just over nine percent of its 42,000 residents are foreign nationals compared to 8.3 percent nationally, according to the National Institute for Statistics.

But analysts would not be surprised if the violent events of recent weeks lead to an anti-immigrant backlash. Far-right parties across Europe have enjoyed a surge in recent years, from Marine Le Pen's Front National in France to the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany to Italy's own Northern League.
Italy's anti-establishment Five Star movement has also seen a big boost in support.

But for minority groups living in the city, the election will be a test which risks confirming their worst fears.

""The first time someone called me 'nigger' I was ten years old and it was by a boy and girl the same age as me. Since then, if anything, things have gotten worse.""

The 22-year-old, named Segen, was one of 93 people taken onboard a rescue boat operated by Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms on Sunday. The organization's founder Oscar Camps had announced Segan's death in a Sicilian hospital on Twitter on Tuesday: ""He was Eritrean and he had spent 19 months in Libya.""

""He was a person,"" said Camps.
Many of those rescued by the Spanish NGO's boat and taken to Pozzallo port in Sicily were suffering from malnutrition, exhaustion and dehydration. The condition of Segen's fellow migrants shocked even people used to seeing distressed arrivals from Libya.

""They were all skin and bone, they looked like they'd come out of a Nazi concentration camp ... it was terrible, "" the mayor of Pozzallo, Roberto Ammatuna. told the Adnkronos news agency.
""Many of the migrants had scabies, but what really left us speechless was their physical condition. Men, women and children without any trace of flesh on them, just a jumble of bones.""
The Open Arms found the boat in which Segen had set sail from Libya with 92 other migrants on Saturday night adrift in the Mediterranean.
Despite his condition rescuers on the Open Arms found two people with even worse cases of malnutrition who had to be urgently evacuated from the ship.
""Who knows how long he hadn't eaten for. He was suffering from advanced organ wasting, he was skeletal,"" said Carmelo Scarso, a local doctor, of Segen to La Repubblica newspaper.
""We've seen plenty of worn out migrants, but this was beyond the limits,"" he said.

					08:59 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy threatens to close airports if Germany starts flying migrants back,"Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini threatened on Sunday to shut the country's airports after media reported that Germany planned to send charter flights of rejected asylum-seekers to Italy.
""If someone in Berlin or Brussels thinks of dropping dozens of migrants via non-authorized charter flights in Italy, they should know that there is not and there will be no airport available,"" Salvini said on Twitter.
""We will close the airports like we closed our ports,"" he added in reference to Italy's decision this summer to ban migrant rescue boats from entering its harbours.
His comments came after German news agency DPA reported on Sunday that Berlin intended to start returning rejected asylum-seekers to Italy via chartered flights. The first flight was due to leave Monday, with another scheduled for October 17th, according to DPA.
The migrants were mainly Nigerians who had entered the European Union via Italy, the agency said.
Similarly, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported Saturday that Germany's federal migration office was sending letters to asylum-seekers, warning them of their ""imminent"" return to Italy under the so-called Dublin rules. That controversial regulation assigns responsibility for migrants to the nation of first entry.
However, Germany's interior ministry told DPA later Sunday that ""no deportations [of migrants] to Italy are planned in the coming days"".
Immigration remains a hot-button issue among European Union members despite a major drop in arrivals following the 2015 peak of the continent's migration crisis.
Germany has welcomed more than a million asylum-seekers, many fleeing war-torn Syria or Iraq, over the past three years. In the face of rifts within her conservative camp and rising xenophobia, Chancellor Angela Merkel has pledged to forge bilateral agreements with EU partner countries for migrant returns.
But while Germany was able to strike deals with frontline nations Greece and Spain, Italy has been a much more reluctant partner at the negotiating table. Salvini, whose anti-immigration League party forms a ruling coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, accuses other EU members of letting Italy shoulder an unfair share of migrants.

These migrants ""were so in need of protection, a roof and a blanket that they decided to leave and disappear,"" Salvini said on Facebook.
""This is the umpteenth confirmation that those who arrive in Italy are not skeletons fleeing war and famine,"" he claimed.
The migrants were picked up by the Diciotti coastguard ship on the night of August 15th and were left stranded at sea for ten days as Salvini refused to allow the vessel to dock in an Italian port. The interior minister, who heads the anti-immigration League party, finally relented after Ireland, Albania and the Italian Catholic church agreed to lake most of them in.
The head of Catholic charity Caritas, which was hosting the migrants at its Rocca di Papa reception centre south of Rome, said it was a ""voluntary departure"".
The group was not in detention, Father Francesco Soddu told Ansa news agency, and suggested that they may be trying to reach other countries in Europe.
""No one wants to stay in Italy, that's well known,"" he said.
Most of those aboard the Diciotti were Eritreans, along with a small number of Somalians, Syrians, Sudanese and Comorans.
Since the start of the year, 3,000 migrants from the former Italian colony of Eritrea have arrived in Italy but fewer than a thousand have applied for asylum, according to interior ministry figures.
Many Eritreans prefer to continue by land to Germany, Sweden or Britain, despite heavy controls at the French, Swiss and Austrian borders, as well as the EU's Dublin regulations under which a migrant can only make an asylum claim in the first European country they reach.
The Rocca di Papa centre found itself the focus of protests after the deal to take in the Diciotti migrants was announced, with neofascist group Casapound calling a rally to coincide with their arrival last week. They were met by a counter-demostration by pro-migrant activists."

Matteo Salvini on Tuesday declared war on mafia networks exploiting foreign
agricultural workers after 16 died in two crashes in the country's south.
The two near-identical crashes, which came within 48 hours of each other outside the city of Foggia in the Puglia region, have put a spotlight on the plight of foreign seasonal tomato-pickers during harvest season.
""It's a mafia problem. In Foggia... there is mafia criminality that I intend to eradicate street by street, town by town, by all means legally available,"" Salvini said at a press conference in Foggia on Tuesday.
Salvini, who is also co-deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, said his anti-migrant campaign would starve criminal gangs of people to exploit.
He also blasted ""unfair competition"" from what he calls imports ""forced"" by the European Union, a favourite target of his.
The Foggia province hosts thousands of African migrants who spend the summer harvesting season picking tomatoes in blazing temperatures alongside workers from eastern Europe, typically Romanians, Bulgarians and Poles.
Although most of those working in the fields in Italy have regular papers, they rarely receive the benefits and salaries required by law, and many live in squalid conditions.
They are often at the mercy of day labourer recruiters -- sometimes linked to organised crime -- who operate as intermediaries and collect a portion of the workers' pay.
Fourteen workers -- all non-EU citizens -- were killed on Monday when the van taking them home from work smashed into a lorry transporting harvested tomatoes.
On Saturday, four African farm workers were killed in another collision with a tomato truck.
That crash provoked dozens of African workers living in one of the province's shanty towns to go on strike on Wednesday morning and march to Foggia.
'Uncontrolled migration'
On Tuesday Salvini said that mafia networks had benefited from ""uncontrolled immigration"".
""If there were not thousands of desperate people to exploit, they would have more trouble doing business,"" he said.
The 45-year-old also announced his intention to tackle the ""importing of slaves"" from within Europe, asking for more stringent checks from his Bulgarian and Romanian counterparts.
Salvini said that Italy's traffic police have seized 300 vehicles in the area in recent months, most of which were ""vans registered in Bulgaria and without insurance"", adding that the service had only 116 officers to control the province's roads.
He said that some Italian farmers should be labelled ""outlaws because some use mafia methods to enrich themselves"".
Salvini also claimed that the EU had helped create the situation that led to the use of what Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte called ""slave labour"" after his own visit to Foggia.
""If Europe didn't force us to accept the importing of Tunisian tomatoes, Moroccan oranges, Burmese rise and Canadian wheat maybe it would be easier for our farmers to live,"" Salvini said."

The Italian government considers France's criticism of its decision to refuse entry to a boat carrying more than 600 people rescued at sea ""unacceptable"", Foreign Affairs Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi stated.
The migrants saved by the Aquarius, run by French NGO SOS Méditerranée, were stuck on the overloaded ship for over 30 hours as Italy and Malta bickered over who should take them, before Spain stepped in and offered the port in Valencia as a place for the migrants to land in Europe.
The accusation by Paris that Rome acted irresponsibly is ""compromising relations between Italy and France"", Milanesi said after summoning French ambassador Christian Masset for a meeting on Wednesday morning.
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to receive Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday, though the meeting has been jeopardized by the ongoing war of words. Meanwhile Finance Minister Giovanni Tria announced that he would cancel an official visit to Paris, though his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire later said the two had agreed to reschedule their talks.
Italy's deputy prime minister called for an official apology before any further summits. In a speech to the senate on Wednesday, Matteo Salvini – who is also Italy's interior minister and head of the nationalist League party – said that France had only taken in 640 of the more than 9,000 people it had promised to take from Italy. He also said that in the five months to the end of May this year France had sent back to Italy 10,249 migrants who had crossed their common border.
""Our history of solidarity, humanity and welcoming spirit does not deserve to be criticized by members of the French government,"" he said.

The French foreign ministry responded that Paris was ""perfectly aware of the weight of migratory pressure on Italy and the efforts of this country"".
""Nothing said by France has questioned this, nor the need to coordinate closely among Europeans,"" a spokesperson said.
Italy's new populist government had earlier said that it would not ""accept hypocritical lessons from countries that have preferred to look the other way on immigration"".
""The Italian government has never abandoned the almost 700 people aboard the Aquarius,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. ""After the refusal of Malta to allow the people aboard the Aquarius to disembark there, we received an unprecedented gesture of solidarity from Spain. The same cannot be said of France, which has often adopted much more rigid and cynical immigration policies.""
Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) that makes up Italy's new government alongside the League, minister of labour and, with Salvini, joint deputy prime minister, said that it was ""embarrassing"" that France ""preached to us"" as Italy is asking its European partners to share duties with Italy.
""I'm pleased that they [France] have discovered responsibility. Let them open their ports and if they want we can send them a few people,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.
But there was also criticism from Spain, despite its gesture of solidarity. Justice Minister Dolores Delgado said that Italy may have violated international humanitarian law, while Ximo Puig, president of the Valencia region, commented: ""Turning this into a political weapon is despicable... it is clear that Europe must act more wisely, but we cannot let these people die at sea.""

Italy's actions won praise, however, from the leaders of Hungary and Slovakia, two EU members that have fiercely resisted hosting asylum seekers.
""Finally!"" said Hungary's anti-immigration Prime Minister Viktor Orban said at a meeting with his Slovak counterpart Peter Pellegrini on Tuesday. ""We assure the Italian government of our complete support,"" he said, adding that he hoped Italy's stance ""can bring a change to Europe's migration policy"".
Yet Slovakia's premier insisted that ""we refuse to let migrants enter our country"", a stance that could bring him into conflict with Italy's new leaders, who have called for the automatic, compulsory resettlement of migrants across all EU countries.
The M5S-League government says that current EU rules, which require migrants to seek asylum wherever in Europe they first arrive, leave Italy and its southern neighbours bearing the brunt of mass migration across the Mediterranean.
It has found hardline allies in Germany and Austria, with the latter saying on Wednesday that the three governments aimed for ""very sensible cooperation that will contribute to reducing illegal migration to Europe"".
The Aquarius is currently sailing for Valencia escorted by two Italian vessels, the Dattilo and Orione, which between them took on board more than 500 of the people rescued for the remainder of the 1,500-km journey after SOS Méditerranée said it was not safe for the Aquarius to continue unassisted.

""Pregnant women, children and refugees will remain in Italy,"" said the minister, who has promised to speed up deportations of illegal immigrants. ""Protection is reserved for humanitarian cases.""
Salvini has been at loggerheads with EU leaders over how to handle the influx of migrants trying to reach the continent, and reiterated that fellow EU member states must help Italy.
A wave of anti-migrant sentiment in the EU has seen countries such as Germany and Austria say they will tighten their border controls and propose sending back migrants to EU countries that previously registered them -- often Italy.
""Before receiving a single asylum-seeker in Italy from another country, we want concrete, precise commitments, deadlines, costs, means on how the European Union will protect our external borders"", he said.
According to the International Organization for Migrants (IOM), 57,160 migrants have arrived in the European Union since the beginning of the year, 80 percent have landed on the Italian, Spanish or Greek coasts."

The ships Lifeline and Seefuchs, of the German NGO Mission Lifeline, ""will be seized by the Italian government and directed into our ports"" to launch an investigation into their legal status, announced Italy's Infrastructure Minister Danilo Toninelli.
The announcement comes after Italy's new populist government earlier this month refused to take in the Aquarius rescue ship, carrying some 630 migrants, sparking an EU migration row.
The Lifeline ship rescued more than 200 people off the coast of Libya on Thursday morning, the NGO said in a statement.

Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini had earlier said that the ship, which flies under the Dutch flag, should ""go to Holland"".
""Foreign NGO boats will never touch Italian soil again,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday morning.

But Toninelli later said that the Dutch government denied that the boat was registered in their country. Responding to a request from the Italian government, the Netherlands said the ship was ""unlawfully, illegally flying the Dutch flag"", Toninelli said in a Facebook video.
The Dutch representation to the European Union tweeted that the ships Seefuchs and Lifeline did not sail under the Dutch flag. ""These ships belong to a German NGO and do not appear in the Dutch naval registers,"" the tweet said, though Mission Lifeline posted a photo of a document that it said showed the contrary.

He added that the boat of putting the migrants' lives in danger, saying the ship had a ""capacity to carry 50 people"" but had taken onboard more than 200.
But unlike Salvini, Toninelli said Italy would take in the migrants. Italy ""will once again save the migrants"" and transfer them onto Italian boats, said Toninelli.
""And we will seize the ship,"" he said, adding that the Seefuchs boat would receive the same treatment. ""For us, saving lives, but safely and legally comes first,"" he said, branding the rescue boats as ""irresponsible"".

Questioned about Lifeline's fate at a rally in the city of Terni on Thursday evening, Salvini said: ""It's a pirate ship, like Captain Hook's,"" Italian news agency AGI reported.
""I don't want ghost ships in Italian ports. If they come to Italy, we will denounce them to the authorities for facilitating illegal immigration,"" he is reported to have said. Salvini has repeatedly accused NGOs of being complicit with human smugglers operating in Libya.
In a statement Lifeline said it had rescued the migrants ""in line with all international regulations"" and called for a ""port of safety to disembark those rescued"". The organization said it feared ""a similar situation to the Aquarius could be on the horizon"".
Earlier this month Salvini refused to open its ports to the Aquarius, leaving it stranded in the Mediterranean. The boat was eventually taken to the port of Valencia in Spain.

					18:20 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Migrants sue Italy for 'moral reparations' over abuses by Libya,"Survivors of a November sea rescue operation by the Libyan coastguard have filed a lawsuit against Italy with the European Court of Human Rights, saying Rome was ultimately responsible for ""violent and reckless"" Libyan actions.
Announced by human rights groups at a press conference on Tuesday, the case was brought by 17 Nigerians who accuse Italy of violating their human rights through what they call the ""subcontracting"" of migrant rescue operations to Libya.
Both countries struck a controversial deal in February 2017 aimed at stemming the flow of people trying to cross the Mediterranean in the hope of arriving in Europe.
Lawyers prosecuting the case say they want the court to order Italy to pay ""moral reparations"" and end the agreement, which it says violates international law, as was ruled in 2012 for a similar deal struck between former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2008.
The agreement has been hailed as a success in Italy thanks to an over 80 percent drop in arrivals so far in 2018 compared to the same period of last year, according to Interior Ministry figures.
However, the lawsuit argues that Italy was responsible both for the actions of the Libyan rescuers due to their fundamental help with logistics, and liable for the subsequent abuses in Libyan detention centres, which are well-documented.
Libya only has the capability to intercept migrant ships thanks to EU funding and support from both the Italian coast guard in Rome and an Italian Navy ship located off the coast of Tripoli.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday and originates from a search-and-rescue operation on November 6th involving NGO Sea Watch which saw the German charity tussle with a Libyan coast guard vessel for the migrants.
Sea Watch estimates ""at least"" 20 people died and claims the Libyan coastguard ""beat and threatened"" survivors as they pulled them out of the sea and off a stricken dinghy, while some dived back into the sea in an effort to reach the Sea Watch boat.
Five bodies were recovered during the operation, which saw 59 people rescued and taken to Italy by Sea Watch and 47 returned to Libya.
Once the sea had been cleared of survivors the Libyans sped off with one person hanging off the side, prompting an Italian navy helicopter to move in to tell the Libyans to slow their vessel down.

The rights groups, including Sea Watch, told reporters that fifteen of the claimants were in Italy while the other two were back in Nigeria after spending time in a Libyan Department of Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) facility.
The two were given a choice between going home or staying in a DCIM centre, places which United Nations human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein called ""an outrage to humanity"" after UN monitors visited the country in November.
The UN slammed conditions in the facilities, where they saw ""emaciated and traumatized men, women and children piled on top of one another"" and gathered eye-witness reports of people being beaten or jabbed with cattle prods if they ask for food or medicine.

					08:09 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Macron meets Italy PM as migrant crisis splits Europe,"French President Emmanuel Macron met Italy's new premier Giuseppe Conte on Friday to try to patch up relations after sparks flew between the two countries over Rome's rejection of a migrant rescue ship.
Conte arrived at the Elysee Palace in Paris for afternoon talks ahead of a press conference, with both smiling as Macron greeted the Italian leader.
Despite efforts by both sides to play down testy exchanges in recent days, the clash underscores deep divisions in Europe over how to handle the massive influx of migrants from across the Mediterranean in recent years.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is embroiled in a showdown with the right wing of her governing coalition, which is demanding that she immediately ditch her liberal migration policy and tighten border controls.
An opinion poll by Infratest Dimap suggests 62 percent of Germans back the tougher stance favoured by her interior minister, including turning back undocumented migrants at the border and deporting rejects faster.
Merkel has pleaded for more time to negotiate with her European partners on a common response ahead of an EU summit on June 28-29.
But there are few signs that European leaders are anywhere near being ready to coordinate their policies despite a looming end-of-June deadline to change the EU's current asylum rules.
Italy 'pushed around'
The Aquarius rescue vessel at the centre of this week's row was continuing on Friday to make its way across the Mediterranean to Spain, which agreed to take the 629 migrants aboard after Italy and Malta refused the ship permission to dock.
Italy's hardline new interior minister Matteo Salvini said he hoped the boat would get ""a rousing welcome"" in Spain, adding that his country was set to present ideas for migration reform to European partners.
""I have already shared a fundamental idea with the Germans and the Austrians -- that of defending external borders with men and money, including the Mediterranean,"" he said.
""We have had enough of being pushed around by others,"" he told residents in the northern Italian city of Genoa.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain, where the Aquarius is expected to arrive on Sunday, called on Twitter for ""a new Europe where national egoism does not prevail"".
Under the EU's Dublin Agreement, which is currently up for review, migrants hoping to apply for asylum must do so in the first country they enter, a policy which has placed a huge burden on Italy in particular.
The influx has encouraged the rise of far-right and populist parties -- leading most recently to an anti-migrant coalition government taking power in Italy.
""We need to work on reform of the Dublin Agreement,"" Conte stressed ahead of his Paris visit.
Earlier this week Salvini joined forces with the German and Austrian foreign ministers in an ""axis of the willing"" to combat illegal immigration.
Other countries meanwhile, such as Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, have either refused outright or resisted taking in refugees under a contested EU quota system.
'Hypocritical lessons'
The spat between France and Italy erupted this week after Macron accused Rome of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the Aquarius dock.
Italy's new government hit back, accusing Paris of giving ""hypocritical lessons"" and threatening to pull out of the meeting with Macron.
Rome also summoned the French ambassador over the dispute -- the second time it has done so over the migrant crisis in two months.
Macron's critics said he was hardly in a position to lecture, noting that France had taken in far fewer migrants since the start of the crisis than the likes of Germany and Sweden, and has sealed off its border to most migrants trying to cross into the country from Italy.
The French leader, who has taken a tough line on migration from African countries that are not at war, said Thursday that ""none of his comments were intended to offend Italy"".
In a further gesture of reconciliation the French foreign ministry said it was ready to welcome migrants aboard Aquarius who ""meet the criteria for asylum"" after they arrive in Spain.
Italy itself has appeared eager to avoid too harsh a response. After turning the Aquarius away, it allowed a coast guard ship carrying over 900 migrants land on Sicily on Wednesday.
And on Thursday, the Italian coast guard brought fresh supplies to the Aquarius as it made its way past Sardinia.

The Aquarius, chartered by MSF and SOS Mediterranee, is the only civilian ship still trying to rescue migrants making the perilous journey from North Africa to Europe.
It is currently carrying 58 migrants rescued in the southern Mediterranean but cannot dock after Panama on Saturday revoked its flag owing to ""non-respect"" of ""international legal procedures"".
Malta has said it will transfer the 58 migrants to one of its boats in international waters and bring them to Malta. They will then be taken to four European countries that have agreed to take them in.

Asked whether the Vatican might give the Aquarius a flag, SOS Mediterranee operations chief Frederic Penard said such an offer would be welcome.
Vatican spokesman Greg Burke declined to comment when asked about the possibility.
Three Swiss lawmakers have meanwhile urged their country to allow the Aquarius to fly the Swiss flag.
The trio -- Ada Marra, Kurt Fluri and Guillaume Barazzone, who all belong to different parties -- made the demand Wednesday in parliament, citing Switzerland's ""long humanitarian tradition"" including migrant protection.
Marra, Fluri and Barazzone asked the government to make use of a clause in maritime law exceptionally permitting such a move and the foreign ministry confirmed to AFP that it was ""competent"" to do so.
""We cannot remain unmoved by the situation of all these migrants who are in danger and in distress in international waters in the Mediterranean. This concerns us all as human beings on this planet,"" Barazzone told RTS radio.

Days before the informal talks – called by Berlin and being attended by some 16 EU leaders – Salvini, who is also Italy's deputy prime minister, warned that nothing less than the EU's future survival was at stake.
""Within a year it will be decided whether there will still be a united Europe or not,"" Salvini told Der Spiegel.
Upcoming EU budget talks, as well as European Parliament elections in 2019 would each act as a litmus test for ""whether the whole thing has become meaningless"", he said.

Sunday's talks are supposed to prepare for a full summit next week, where all 28 EU leaders will discuss plans to overhaul the bloc's asylum system, which has been under severe pressure since the migration crisis exploded in
2015.
Nevertheless, German Chancellor Angela Merkel – who is facing a ferocious political backlash for letting in well over a million asylum seekers into Europe's biggest economy – played down expectations that a solution could be found quickly.
Speaking on a visit to Lebanon, Merkel said that ""we know that no solution will be reached on Thursday and Friday at the level of the 28 member states ... on the overall issue of migration"".
Instead, she said, ""bilateral, trilateral and multilateral"" deals must be reached to tackle the issue.

Salvini, who heads the anti-immigration League party, has come to personify Rome's new confrontational and unbending stance. It was he who barred the French NGO-run Aquarius rescue ship, carrying some 630 migrants, from docking in Italy, triggering an EU-wide row.
On Thursday, he turned his sights to the German NGO, Mission Lifeline.
""The illegal boat Lifeline is now in Maltese waters with its cargo of 239 migrants. For the safety of its crew and the passengers, we've asked Malta to open its ports,"" Salvini wrote on Twitter.
""Clearly, the boat should immediately be impounded and its crew arrested,"" he added.
A source close to the Maltese government said that Valetta had not yet received any official request from Rome, nor had Lifeline itself sought any permission to land.
""Italian ports are no longer at the disposal of traffickers. Open the Maltese ports! Open the French ports,"" Salvini said in Sienna, where a second round of local elections was being held on Sunday.
READ ALSO: Italy will 'dare to say no' to EU on migrants, says Salvini
Salvini's uncompromising line found an echo Friday when Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he was also ready to start turning away migrants if Berlin and Vienna did so, as Germany's interior minister proposed earlier this week.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer warned on Monday that he would give Merkel a fortnight to find a European deal to curb new arrivals by the June 28-29th EU summit, failing which he vowed to order border police to turn back migrants.
Rome had briefly weighed boycotting Sunday's mini-summit, but finally agreed to attend after reassurances from Merkel. Italy had been riled because a leaked draft statement focused more on the redistribution of the migrants once they had arrived in Europe, rather than on securing Europe's borders, but the government was placated after Merkel told them the text had been shelved.
Nevertheless, tensions continue to simmer very close to the surface, and tempers can flare up very quickly.
On Friday, Italy took offence when French President Emmanuel Macron likened rising nationalism and anti-migrant sentiment in Europe to ""leprosy"".
""One day, he's saying that he doesn't want to offend Italy, and then the next, he's talking about leprosy,"" said Italy's other deputy prime minister and head of the populist M5S party, Luigi Di Maio.
""We may be leper populists. But I take the lessons from those who open their own ports. Welcome thousands of migrants and then we can talk,"" said Salvini.

""On Thursday, I will put on the European table at Innsbruck a demand to close Italian ports to ships of international missions,"" Salvini said on his Twitter account, referring to a meeting with his EU counterparts in the Austrian town next week.
""Unfortunately, Italy's governments over the past five years signed accords allowing all boats to bring their migrants in Italy,"" he said.
Italy's new coalition government has set a goal of zero arrivals, and Salvini, who heads the far-right League party, has already banned boats chartered by charities to enter Italian ports.
The French rescue ship Aquarius and the German boat Lifeline were forced to divert to Spain and Malta respectively last month.
The Innsbruck meeting will be the first of EU justice and interior ministers under the new Austrian presidency of the EU.
Salvini did not name any of the several missions currently patrolling the Mediterranean, but typical among them is the Sophia, EU's anti-trafficking operation set up in 2015 to fight human trafficking.
It is under Italian command with headquarters in Rome.
Another is the Mediterranean maritime border patrol mission Triton, launched in 2014 by Frontex to fight human trafficking. It uses NATO ships in some of its operations.
Overnight Saturday, 106 migrants arrived in the eastern Sicilian port of Messina after they were rescued Thursday off of Libya by the Irish naval vessel Samuel Beckett.
For the time being, Italy must still accept migrants rescued by its own coast guard or by cargo ships asked to intervene by the Italian coast guard.
Since the start of the year, 16,687 migrants have arrived in Italy including some 11,000 from Libya, or 80 percent fewer than last year over the same period, according to Italian interior ministry figures out Thursday."

Spain's new Socialist government on Monday said it would allow the boat to dock at its eastern port of Valencia after Italy and Malta refused to accept it.
The Aquarius, which is run by SOS Mediterranee and MSF, is expected to arrive in Valencia at the weekend.
""The detour of the Aquarius is clearly a symbol of the failure of the European Union and European governments with their contradictory policies,"" the head of MSF Spain, David Noguera, told AFP by telephone from Barcelona.
""It is a very negative precedent. The truth is there is a question on the table as to whether this is a single event which is resolved quickly, or if we will no longer be allowed to dock in Italy and the blockage continues which would completely change rescue operations.""
The Aquarius rescued the migrants including 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 other children and several pregnant women, from inflatable boats and rafts off the coast of Libya and took them toward Italy, but the country's new far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini barred it from docking, saying it should go to Malta.
Malta also refused to take the ship, saying it was Italy's responsibility since the rescue was overseen by the Italian coastguard.
Salvini declared victory after the standoff over the fate of the hundred of migrants on board prompted Spain to agree to accept them.
""That the Aquarius was diverted to Spain is not a victory for anyone, not for Salvini although he thinks so, and not for MSF or the European Union and especially not for the refugees,"" Noguera said.
""Today a boat that should be rescuing people at sea will spend 10 days outside of the rescue zone, and that will cause more deaths, that is obvious.""
The 629 migrants on board the Aquarius come from 26 different countries -- 23 in Africa in addition to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, according to MSF Spain.
Spain's new Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who toppled his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote on June 1st after a corruption scandal, made his offer to accept the migrants after the left-wing mayors of Valencia and Barcelona both offered to take the boat in at their ports.
""We obviously thank the Spanish government for the gesture, but we ask that it not be a one-off gesture, that it lead the European Union in a change of policies, so that the response to this phenomena is more human,"" Noguera said.

The biggest EU country, where Chancellor Angela Merkel faces domestic pressure to reduce arrivals of migrants and refugees, had reached a similar deal with Spain on August 8th.
""We have reached an agreement with Greece... and the conclusion is imminent,"" said interior ministry spokeswoman Eleonore Petermann, pointing to a last outstanding exchange of letters.
""We remain in talks with Italy, and these talks have advanced quite a long way,"" she added at a Berlin press conference. ""We assume that an agreement will also be reached with Italy.""
She gave no details on the Athens accord, but the agreement with Madrid allows Berlin to send back Spanish-registered migrants within 48 hours of their arrival on German soil.
Merkel has been under pressure to reduce the number of new arrivals after a record influx of more than a million asylum seekers between 2015 and 2016 unsettled Germany.
The issue of tighter border controls sparked a major clash in July between the chancellor and hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer which brought their coalition to the brink of collapse.
Germany has since sought a series of bilateral agreements with EU partners, after a broader accord for the bloc proved elusive.
Italy has however been reluctant. Its Interior Minister Matteo Salvini of the far-right League party has said Rome first expects to see more action to toughen the EU's external borders.
Italian ports remained closed to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean throughout much of July, although Italy has agreed to accept some rescue ships as of July 24th. The recently-inaugurated Italian government has been at loggerheads with the EU on the issue of who should accept responsibility for sea arrivals.

The German political row was triggered when Seehofer, who heads Merkel's more traditional CSU sister party, threatened to turn back migrants at German borders if they had already made asylum requests in other EU countries.
Fearing the domino-effect of borders slamming shut such unilateral action would unleash, Merkel instead pushed for a wider EU response that would include migrant return deals with the frontline states Greece, Italy and Spain.

Emmanuel Macron's rocky relationship with Italy's ruling populists worsened this weekend when far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini blasted the French president's ""arrogant"" stance on immigration.
Salvini further accused Macron of hypocrisy for criticising his hardline approach while France continues to ""push back women, children and men"" across the border back into Italy.
Macron, who argues that France has taken in more asylum seekers than Italy this year as the massive influx across the Mediterranean has slowed, hit back: ""We won't take lessons from anyone.""
The heated exchange overshadowed a weekend meeting in Brussels that was supposed to find better ways to handle the hundreds of thousands arriving from Africa, the Middle East and Asia since 2015. European leaders are set to meet on Thursday and Friday in Brussels to discuss the issue as well as eurozone reforms.

Macron was perhaps destined to get on badly with Salvini after coming to power in an election that pitched his pro-EU centrism against the far-right populism of Marine Le Pen.
He won no friends in Rome last week by likening anti-migrant sentiment to ""leprosy"", and compounded the row by suggesting that with arrival numbers down, Italy did not have a migrant crisis but a political one. He had already attracted Italy's ire by criticising its refusal to take in 630 migrants onboard the Aquarius rescue ship, and a Franco-Spanish proposal for ""closed"" migrant camps in arrival countries went down similarly badly.
France's ambassador to Rome was summoned this month over the row, and while Macron is heading to the Vatican Tuesday to meet Pope Francis, he is not stopping in Rome to meet Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
""The political leaders of Italy and France have not treated each other this badly since they were at war,"" Aldo Cazzullo observed in the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
From Napoleon to Libya
Analysts say the chill reflects not just a clash of political worldviews but a long history of animosity.
The 20th century saw times of both bitter enmity during World War II and close cooperation as the neighbours worked together to build the EU afterwards.
Gilles Bertrand, co-author of a history of Franco-Italian relations since 1660, sees traces of centuries-old invasions by European powers, including France under Napoleon Bonaparte, in contemporary suspicions.
""Even though they are extremely close culturally, with ties going back to the Middle Ages -- commercial, intellectual, artistic -- it goes down badly when France acts superior,"" said Bertrand, a professor of modern history at the University of Grenoble Alpes.

More recently, resentment brimmed over the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya -- a former Italian colony -- which was heavily backed by France.
""The Italians are hugely sensitive when it comes to Libya,"" said Jean-Pierre Darnis, a lecturer at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis who specialises in Franco-Italian relations. ""Their reading of it is that in 2011 France intervened in Libya to dislodge them"" in their former sphere of influence, he told AFP.
Italy also views Libya's current lawlessness -- a driving force in the migrant exodus from the North African country -- as the direct result of the intervention, an additional source of anger, he said.
The bombing campaign was before Macron's time, but soon after his arrival in power last year he aggravated tensions over Libya again by organising a spontaneous peace conference independently of Italy.

'Economic colonialism'
The last few years have also seen growing tensions between the neighbours over investment projects.
French companies invested heavily in Italy in the 1990s and 2000s, including luxury group LVMH's acquisition of the Fendi label in 2001 and Bulgari a decade later.
Yet the value of French takeovers since 2000 has been more than five times higher of the value of Italian takeovers in France, according to financial analysts Dealogic -- leading to regular accusations of ""economic colonialism"".
On this front, again, Macron's presidency got off to a bad start -- he temporarily nationalised the STX shipyard instead of giving a majority stake to Italy's Fincantieri, reneging on an agreement between Rome and the previous French government.
A face-saving deal was eventually worked out to hand the Italian shipbuilder 50 percent of STX, ""but it did a huge amount of damage,"" said Darnis.
""It wiped out pretty much all of Macron's political capital in Italy,"" he added.

Italy, on the frontline of Europe's migrant crisis, has turned away rescue vessels with its new populist government demanding greater solidarity from reluctant fellow EU states.
Salvini, who will be the first member of the new government to visit Libya, on Sunday bluntly told foreign charities to stop rescuing migrants off the North African coast, where one group said 1,000 people were on boats in distress.
""Let the Libyan authorities do their work of rescue, recovery and return (of migrants) to their country, as they have been doing for some time, without the ships of the voracious NGOs disturbing them or causing trouble,"" he said. ""Italian ports are and will be closed to those who aid human traffickers,"" he said.
In an interview published Monday with the newspaper La Repubblica, Libya's deputy premier Ahmed Maiteeq said he hoped to work with the Italian government on the issue.
""The cooperation between Italy and Libya is crucial,"" he said, adding that the arrival of migrants was also ""a major problem"" for his country.
""Traffickers who bring migrants to Italy are dangerous criminal groups for us, who prevent Libya from taking a step toward a difficult normalisation. All of Europe must think of structural measures to take in African countries to stop migrants.""
Hundreds of people fleeing conflict and persecution at home are caught in the midst of a worsening row over how to deal with the influx of migrants against a backdrop of mass drownings in the Mediterranean in recent years.
One boat, the Lifeline, remained in limbo on Sunday with 239 Africans aboard, including pregnant women and children. Malta and Italy refused to take it in after the Aquarius suffered a similar fate until it was allowed to dock in Spain.
On Sunday, 16 of the EU's 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.
According to Salvini, the Libyan coast guard rescued 820 migrants in the Mediterranean last weekend alone.

The ship, escorted by two Italian vessels, is not expected to dock on the Italian island as it continues its journey to Valencia, Spain, where authorities have offered safe harbour for the 629 people the boat rescued from the Mediterranean last weekend.
They have not set foot on land since then, after both of the closest countries, Italy and Malta, refused them entry. With several days' sailing to go before they reach the Spanish coast, worsening weather and many onboard suffering from sea sickness, the Italian coastguard ship leading the convoy decided to direct the boats closer to land.
The convoy will now proceed between Sardinia and mainland Italy, ""to shelter from the weather that is otherwise unbearable for the people aboard, who are exhausted, suffering from shock and sea sick,"" the French NGO that operates the Aquarius, SOS Méditerranée.

Earlier, the rescue group had reported strong winds and waves of more than four metres that left many passengers unwell after four days at sea.
Since Tuesday, the passengers have been divided between the Aquarius, the coastguard boat Dattilo and a ship that belongs to the Italian military.
The Italian coastguard is responsible for conducting those rescued to shore since it coordinated the multiple rescue operations that brought them aboard the Aquarius, an SOS Méditerranée spokesperson told The Local.
The convoy made a stop near Sicily on Wednesday to pick up more supplies, the NGO said.

				08:42 CET+01:00			 
					08:42 CET+01:00				",AFP,'Historic' turning point in Italy's migrant crisis,"The year 2017 marked what Italian authorities hope was a turning point in the nation's struggle to manage a chaotic and deadly rush of migrants to its shores.
Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni this week called it a pivotal moment in Italy's ""historic transition from immigration managed by criminals to controlled, legal and safe migration"".
While migrants who made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean in rickety boats still numbered nearly 119,000, it was a roughly one-third drop over the previous year.
However, Italy's effort to tackle the issue has not been without controversy, including its moves to enlist the help of powerful militias to curb traffickers' activity.
Still the situation as 2017 closes, is vastly different than the first half of the year.
Between January and June, Italy saw a nearly 20 percent jump in the number of migrants arriving by sea, while asylum applications exploded as its EU neighbours -- France, Switzerland and Austria -- had closed their borders.
In just the last three days of June, a total of 10,400 people landed in Italy as its neighbours refused to allow even a single ship of migrants rescued off the coast of Libya to dock.
With legislative elections on the horizon -- now set for March 2018 -- immigration has been a key issue, particularly for Italy's right and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S).
Italy has tried to adapt how it handles the migrants on its soil, trying prioritise smaller reception centres believed to help new arrivals get on their feet.
Still tens of thousands of asylum seekers languish in large shelters, feeding into the mutual distrust of surrounding neighbourhoods.
'Inhuman'
But everything began to change in July as migrant boat departures from Libya suddenly dropped. The downward trend continued to the point that sea arrivals over the past six months have fallen by 70 percent compared with the same period last year.
The drop has been attributed to a controversial combination of an Italian-led boosting of the Libyan coastguard's ability to intercept boats and efforts to seek the assistance of powerful militias.
There have also been moves to tighten Libya's southern borders, accelerate repatriations directly from Libya and measures to stem the flow of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa through transit states such as Niger and Sudan.
It seemed to pay off as in early December, with the Libyan navy saying a total of 80,000 migrants were rescued or intercepted in 2017.
However, harrowing accounts emerged of desperate migrants throwing themselves overboard in order to avoid being sent back to the chaos in Libya.
Migrants intercepted or rescued by the Libyans are usually held in detention centres to await repatriation, but waiting times are often long and conditions deplorable.
International outrage over the situation was stoked in November by a CNN television report on migrant Africans being sold as slaves in Libya.
It got to the point that the EU's decision to help Libya intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and return them to detention centres was condemned as ""inhuman"" by the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Safe corridors
Italy has continued to press its contacts in Libya to push ahead with another prong of its migrant policy. It has sought the processing of migrants on-site, in cooperation with UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), with a programme of repatriating economic migrants and transferring vulnerable people.
Returns increased from 1,200 in 2016 to over 19,000 in 2017. As far as refugees, Italy last week became the first country to welcome a group of 162 Ethiopian, Somali and Yemeni refugees flown in directly from Libya.
Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti says up to 10,000 refugees could benefit from these humanitarian corridors in 2018, provided they can be spread among EU partners.
""There is a reliable path we can take. We would not be pretending that the problem does not exist, but rather managing it humanely and safely"" for both Italian citizens and migrants, Gentiloni said this week.
Despite these efforts, crossings remain deadly. According to the IOM, at least 2,833 men, women and children died or went missing off Libya this year, compared to 4,581 in 2016, a relatively constant level of about 1 in 40."

					09:56 CEST+02:00				",AFP,ANALYSIS: Why Italy's standoff over migrants is a problem for the whole EU,"A row between Italy's populist government and the EU could sink hopes of ending Europe's longstanding crisis over migrants, and even raises doubts about Rome's place in the bloc, analysts and officials say.
Despite a sharp drop in asylum seekers entering Europe since a 2015 peak, Italy is turning away ships with migrants rescued at sea in a campaign to make EU countries take their share.
In the latest standoff, Rome has threatened to cut its annual contribution to the EU budget, triggering a warning of sanctions from Brussels and dark threats that it would be breaching the very treaties that underpin the bloc's existence.
The increasingly bitter dispute highlights how elusive a three-year search for EU solidarity on migration has been -- a problem some warn could even sink the post-war European project.
""We do have a crisis of solidarity,"" Marie De Somer, an analyst with the Brussels-based thinktank European Policy Centre (EPC) told AFP.
Despite an apparent deal by EU leaders meeting in Brussels on June 29th, Italy has continued to reject rescue ships until EU countries agree to take their share of migrants.
Nearly 140 migrants who had been stranded on the Diciotti coastguard ship at a port in Sicily were allowed to disembark on Sunday after Ireland and non-EU member Albania agreed to take some of them in.
But the European Commission, the executive of the 28-nation bloc, is still trying to broker a deal for a permanent mechanism among EU countries to take in migrants aboard these ships.

As the week-long standoff over the Diciotti worsened on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio warned that Rome could cut its funding for the bloc.
""The European Union has decided to turn its back on Italy once again,"" complained Di Maio, from the populist Five Star movement, which is in coalition with a hardline anti-immigration party.
The European Commission, which coordinates migration policy, said the EU ""operates on the basis of rules, not threats"" as it hit back at Di Maio's comments.
Guenther Oettinger, the EU's budget commissioner, warned Italy would be running risks by becoming the first in EU history to refuse to pay its budget contribution.
""This would result in late payment interests. And a breach of Treaty obligations leading to possible further heavy sanctions,"" Oettinger warned on Twitter.
READ ALSO: Italy threatens to stop paying into EU unless bloc takes in stranded migrants
The EPC's De Somer said the split is not as deep as it seems, as the Commission and the European Parliament both back Italy's demand that other member countries share more of the responsibility for migrants.
""It's the same policy Italy is advocating for,"" De Somer told AFP.
The problem is with many EU member countries -- particularly with the former communist states in eastern Europe -- that refuse to admit asylum seekers.
""There is no worse deaf person than someone who doesn't want to hear,"" Sylvie Guillaume, a member of a European Parliament committee dealing with migration, told AFP.
Countries led by Hungary rejected an EU scheme agreed in 2015 to relocate 160,000 Syrian and other asylum seekers from Italy and Greece, the main landing points during Europe's worst migration crisis since World War II.

Under international law, EU countries must grant asylum to people fleeing war and persecution but not to those escaping poverty and seeking jobs, who can be sent back to their countries.
Italy has pleaded for distinguishing genuine asylum seekers from economic migrants before they disembark from ships, and has gradually hardened its tone.
Even though Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte proclaimed Rome was ""no longer alone"" after the June summit, his government is increasingly sceptical of the results.
The summit called for setting up ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc, most likely in North Africa, in a bid to discourage migrants boarding EU-bound smuggler boats.
But so far no deals have been struck.
""It will take enormous diplomatic and financial capital, and it will take years before they even start working,"" De Somer said.
The summit also called for EU states to set up migrant processing centres -- but while they all welcomed the plan, no one has volunteered to host one.
""You'll still have to agree on which member states will take how many refugees,"" Somer said.

The victims were returning from working in the fields when their van collided “very violently” with the truck, Repubblica reports.
The workers’ van, which had a Bulgarian license plate and was carrying all non-EU passengers, collided head-on with a truck full of tomatoes on a road at the junction for Ripalta, in the countryside of Lesina.
The fatal crash comes just two days after a very similar incident in the same area on Saturday, in which four African agricultural laborers died and another five are in a critical condition in hospital.
Their van also collided with a truck carrying tomatoes on the way back from a work shift in the Capitanata fields.
Every summer thousands of workers, mostly migrants, arrive in the Puglian countryside for the harvest of tomatoes and other crops.
According to the Italian aid group Doctors for Human Rights (Medu), the thousands of migrants come mainly from Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Mali, Uganda, Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. They’re often working for minimal wages and sleeping without electricity or running water in conditions that the NGO describes as “shamefully inhumane"".
We want to know if someone is responsible, if the deaths were an avoidable tragedy,” Fai Cisl, an agricultural labourers’ trade union, stated. “And if the transport was regulated, or if the workers were crammed into the van as still happens unfortunately, very often ""

					11:34 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Record migrant arrivals in Italy as tensions rise,"October marked a record monthly high in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent years, with over 27,000 people reaching its shores.
Italy's interior ministry released figures Thursday showing that 26,161 people -- almost all from West Africa and the Horn of Africa -- arrived here this month. Almost another 1,000 were pulled from their dinghies later that day.
Even at the height of recent summers, arrivals have only ever once exceeded 25,000 a month. The new record brings the total number this year to 159,000, outstripping the 2015 total of 153,000 and approaching the record of 170,000 arrivals in 2014.
""The smugglers are certainly better organised, since they have been able to send off up to 11,000 people in two days,"" Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Italy, told AFP.
""But the migrants tell us they are afraid that the route will close in a few months,"" particularly with a new European programme launching this week to train the Libyan coast guard.
""And if there is one thing that migrants do not want, it is to be rescued by Libyan coastguards, who take them to detention centres and plunge them back into the cycle of abuse and violence,"" he added.
The IOM, which speaks to the arriving migrants, heard ""staggering"" stories of torture, rape, starvation and murder in the crisis-hit country, he said.
Many were squeezing onto the overcrowded smuggler dinghies and increasingly unseaworthy boats, with over 200 people dying in the last ten days and fears of greater tragedies to come in the coming weeks if the mass departures continue.
Barricades
Italy finds itself in a particularly challenging position with most of the new arrivals forced to remain in the country due to border blocks imposed by its neighbours.
Centres for asylum-seekers -- now overwhelmingly located in former hotels-- housed 66,000 people in 2014 and 103,000 by the end of 2015. That figure has now hit 171,000, and local authorities are struggling to find new places.
Despite the government's plan to spread migrants throughout the country, with an average of three migrants per 1,000 inhabitants, many mayors are resisting, backed sometimes by protesting locals.
On Monday, people in Gorino, a village of some 700 people in the Delta delPo, erected barricades to prevent the arrival of 12 women in a hotel that had been requisitioned.
""This is not how Italians do things,"" raged the Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, though he was forced to allow the project to be abandoned and the women settled in elsewhere.
But Italy's anti-migrant Northern League party praised ""the new heroes of the resistance against the dictatorship of hospitality"".
And during a protest late Thursday outside a barracks in Milan set to soon house 300 migrants, the party's leader Matteo Salvini called on security forces to rebel.
""It is right to obey, but so is it right to disobey bad orders,"" he added in comments slammed by two police unions Friday as ""a very serious and irresponsible provocation""."

The group had refused to hand the migrants over to the Libyan coastguard, despite warnings from Rome and what the NGO claimed were death threats from the Libyans. The prosecutor's office of Catania in eastern Sicily has opened an investigation into Proactiva Open Arms and three of its leaders for criminal conspiracy to promote illegal immigration.

""Today it seems that solidarity has become a crime,"" said Open Arms co-founder Oscar Camps at a press conference in Barcelona. ""What is being done is the blocking of intervention of humanitarian organizations at sea. There are fewer and fewer NGOs doing this work and the objective is that there are none any left,"" he said.
""Finally an Italian prosecutor's office is blocking human trafficking!"" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, which leads the rightwing coalition that won the largest percentage of the vote in Italy's March 4th general election.
One in every 17 migrants dead
On Thursday, the Open Arms ship went to the aid of two boats that were in difficulty 73 nautical miles (135 nautical kilometres) off the Libyan coast, after being alerted by the Italian coastguard. But Italian authorities then informed the NGO's ship that the Libyan coastguard was in charge.
A Libyan coastguard speedboat arrived at the scene after an hour, but the NGO refused to transfer the migrants despite the threats it claims to have received. The ship was allowed to dock in Pozzallo on Saturday by the authorities because of the ""frail condition of the migrants on board"".

Following controversial agreements made by Rome with Libyan authorities and militias, migrant landings have dropped by more than 60 percent since the summer of 2017.
So far this year Italy has recorded 6,100 arrivals. In that time at least 358 migrants have died or are missing off the coast of Libya, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
That means one migrant dead for every 17 that arrive in Italy, significantly up from the rate of one for every 33 over the same period last year.
Fewer rescue ships
Last year around a dozen NGO ships patrolled the coast off Libya, and according to the Italian coastguard they carried out 46 percent of all migrant rescue operations. Now there are only two such ships, with others suspending their operations following the drop in departures from Libya last summer, as well as threats from Libya and the seizure of boats.
Catania's public prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro made a series of statements last year against NGOs operating in the Mediterranean, saying he had evidence some had been in contact with people traffickers.

This time Zuccaro's office was more circumspect, telling Italian media that Proactiva Open Arms was acting with the sole purpose of landing the migrants in Italy, refusing any alternative.
The condition of migrants in Libya has been heavily criticized by humanitarian organizations.
A 22-year-old Eritrean, rescued alongside other skeletal migrants by the Open Arms ship last week after spending 18 months in detention in Libya, died from severe malnutrition just hours after landing in Sicily.
Last summer Italian authorities seized the Iuventa ship run by the German group Jugend Rettet. Italian courts have so far backed that seizure, with a new hearing scheduled for April 23rd in Rome.
Proactiva Open Arms will find out about the fate of its ship by Tuesday, by which time judge from nearby Ragusa will confirm the seizure or allow it to leave Pozzallo.

""There's a political crisis between Italy and the rest of Europe,"" Macron said on Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
""Italy has decided not to respect the rules of international law, and maritime and humanitarian law in particular.""
The French president was speaking after France, Germany, Spain and Portugal agreed to host 58 people who were picked up in the Mediterranean last week by the NGO ship Aquarius, which remained at sea for several days in search of a friendly port.
It was the latest standoff between a rescue ship and Italy's coalition government, which declared Italian ports closed to all ships carrying migrants – even Italian coastguard boats – after it took power in June.
In the latest crisis Italy, Malta and Tunisia refused the Aquarius harbour, and Italian authorities instructed it to hand the migrants over to the Libyan coastguard. The two organizations that operate the Aquarius, SOS Méditerranée and Doctors Without Borders, refused on the grounds that conditions in Libya are unsafe.

The 58 on board the Aquarius will now be transferred to a Maltese naval vessel and taken to Malta, it was announced on Tuesday, from where they will be distributed between the four other countries that have offered to host them. The Aquarius will proceed to Marseille in France, where SOS Méditerranée has a headquarters.
Responding to Macron's criticism, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that the French president was entitled to his opinion, ""but sometimes opinions are mistaken"".
""Macron represents France and not the EU,"" Conte added. ""We don't have any problems with France.""
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has been fiercely critical of Macron, was celebrating on Tuesday after EU sources cautiously welcomed parts of his proposals to make it easier for Italy to expel people whose request for asylum is denied.
Salvini's bill, which has yet to be approved by parliament, would also toughen the criteria for receiving permission to stay on humanitarian grounds and allowing Italy to strip naturalized Italians of their citizenship if they are found to have committed certain crimes.

The tally was the highest reported out of Libya for a one-week period since mid-July saw a dramatic fall in the number of migrants trying to reach Europe.

Six years since a revolution and NATO intervention that toppled dictator Moamer Kadhafi, violence-wracked Libya has become a key gateway for clandestine migration to Europe with nearest European country Italy bearing the brunt of the fallout.
Most of the latest rescue operations in Libyan waters were staged off the cities of Zawiya and Sabratha, Libyan navy spokesman General Ayoub Kacem said in a statement.
He added the Libyan coast guard rescued 2,082 migrants in nine operations from Monday-Friday - adding one woman had died - while Saturday saw a further 1,047 people picked up.
Italy, the closest and main destination, has recorded 6,500 arrivals since mid-July, barely 15 percent of the figure for the same period in the past three years.

A further 200 people were picked up off the Italian island of Lampedusa and the Sicilian coast. One Irish patrol vessel, the William Butler Yeats, disembarked on Sunday some 550 migrants at the eastern Sicilian port of Augusta as well as three dead bodies, two women and a child, who the Red Cross said was a three-year-old Cameroonian.

With a coalition of the anti-system Five Star Movement (M5S) and the nationalist League party in power, the prospects for migrants reaching Italy after a hazardous sea crossing from Libya look even dimmer.
The previous centre-left government already all but closed the maritime border following controversial accords signed with the Libyan government as well as local authorities, including armed groups, in an effort to curb the migrant influx.

Now the new, populist government has signalled it will push EU partners to shore up the bloc's external frontiers and accept an automatic and more equitable shareout of migrants across the continent. It also wants to speed up asylum procedures and repatriate those rejected and those from countries deemed ""safe"".
To help fund the process the government would reallocate some of the budget – in 2017, €4.2 billion used in rescues, providing sanitary assistance and running reception centres.

Arrivals down 'but not suffering'
Arrivals of migrants to Italy slowed by some 80 percent from July 2016 to July 2017 after Marco Minniti, a veteran secret services coordinator who became interior minister in December 2016, reached an accord with Tripoli to keep migrants in detention centres on Libyan soil.
Human rights groups and the United Nations have blasted most of the centres for their ""inhuman"" conditions.
The arrivals have fallen also due to a key change in procedure. Whereas previously the Italian coast guard coordinated rescue operations from Rome, operational authority now largely resides with Tripoli.
For the migrants, the difference is critical. Coordination by Rome means they are taken to Italy whereas Tripoli taking charge means they again are left at the mercy of a system stalked by violence and extortion as well as poor conditions.
""The arrivals have gone down but not the suffering,"" says Carlotta Sami, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

Migrants concur. ""I was not afraid of the water, because God created the water. I'm not afraid of death. We all die one day. I'm more afraid if the Libyan police were to catch me again, because they are so wicked,"" said Vitoria, a 21-year-old Nigerian who arrived in Sicily earlier this month after spending months, she told AFP, in terrible conditions in Libya.
She was taken aboard The Aquarius, a ship chartered by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors without Borders (MSF), after she was first picked up by a smaller boat run by a Spanish NGO following a call from the Italian coastguard.
The crew on the first boat had been told Libya was coordinating the rescue, but the North African country's coastguard did not appear. After a three-day delay, Italy eventually accepted their transfer.
Non-governmental organizations are hamstrung by Tripoli telling vessels to keep their distance – even in cases where the Libyans cannot intervene themselves owing to distance or lack of resources.
""This puts us in impossible situations,"" says Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for German NGO Sea-Watch. ""If we obey, we are violating the obligation to rescue. If we do not obey, we risk not being able to bring the migrants to Italy or see our vessel seized by Italian authorities.""
'More dangerous than ever'
Recent weeks have also seen the Italians force NGO vessels from rescue zones for days at a time, a tactic which SOS Mediterranee director Frederic Penard says means that ""the priority is no longer rescue effectiveness"".
""Crossings are today more dangerous than ever,"" says IOM Mediterranean region director Federico Soda. His organization has registered 383 dead or disappeared off Libya so far this year – 2.8 percent of known departures, up from 2.2 percent in previous years.
Italy's new government hopes to pull from its sleeve another card, one which Minniti has already tried – in vain – to play. It would see Italy simply refuse to take in migrants picked up by European, military or humanitarian rescue vessels.
The populist MS5 and the hard right League hope to send home as quickly as possible the bulk of new arrivals by speeding asylum procedures and systematically kicking out those whose claims are rejected, as well as an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants.
But at the current rate – just 6,514 official expulsions in 2017 amid opposition from countries of origin to take back their nationals – the process could take more than 75 years, Italian media say.

					17:58 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Spanish migrant rescuers hit out at Italian boat seizure,"The Spanish group whose migrant rescue boat has been impounded by the Italian authorities hit out Thursday at what it called a deliberate campaign to ensure there were no independent witnesses to how refugees are treated while trying to flee from Libya to Italy.
""Proactiva Open Arms is the new target of a clear institutional, political and media campaign that wants to keep away witnesses who could denounce human rights violations in the Mediterranean,"" founder Oscar Camps told a news conference.
The Proactiva Open Arms group, which has saved more than 5,000 migrants since the start of 2017, had its boat impounded at the port of Pozzallo in Sicily, where it arrived on Saturday with more than 200 people rescued off the coast of Libya.
The non-governmental group had refused to hand the migrants over to the Libyan coastguard, despite warnings from Rome and what the NGO claimed were death threats from the Libyans.
The prosecutor's office in Catania in eastern Sicily has opened an investigation into the NGO and three of its leaders for criminal conspiracy to promote illegal immigration.
Nevertheless, Camps argued that returning the migrants to Libya, where the situation is chaotic and human rights violations are common, ""would mean sending them back to the hell they have fled.""
The NGO's legal adviser, Jaime Rodrigo, an expert in marine law, said the legal justification for impounding the boat was ""non-existent"".
""It is possible that the boat will be held for a very long time, because the seizure can last as long as the procedure, and we know how long the procedures are,"" he said.
The boat is currently the NGO's only craft in operation and its seizure means Proactiva Open Arms, which is facing financial difficulties, cannot carry out any more rescue operations.
""We are flies and they're using cannons to fire at us,"" Camps said, calling for private donations and support from institutions.
Italy is the main entry point for migrants arriving in Europe across the Mediterranean.
According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), as of March 25, more than 6,100 migrants had reached Italian shores since the beginning of the year and 359 have died.
In 2017, the number of arrivals in Italy was close to 22,000, with 727 deaths.

					09:43 CEST+02:00				",,Opinion: 'New EU migrant processing centres must avoid inhumanity of 'hotspots' in Greece and Italy',"EU leaders have agreed to create migrant centres to speed up processing time as a compromise to appease Italy. But care should be taken to avoid the mistakes of similar centres in Greece and Italy, writes Samantha Velluti, a Reader in Law at the UK's University of Sussex.
A new plan to set up ""controlled centres"" to hold migrants once they arrive in EU territory risks repeating many mistakes of the past, bypassing due process and breaching fundamental human rights and international law.
At the EU’s June summit in Brussels, leaders agreed to create centres within EU member states to speed up the processing of asylum requests and assist those countries on the rim of the Mediterranean sea – such as Italy, Malta and Greece – with the mass inflow of migrants. No country would be forced to set up a ""controlled centre"", though it’s still unclear who will.
The proposed centres would facilitate the distinction between irregular economic migrants, earmarked for return under the auspices of the International Organisation for Migration, and those in need of international protection, who would be relocated and resettled in those EU member states that would agree to take them under the principle of solidarity.
The plan is a compromise reached at the end of a tense and fractious summit to appease an exasperated Italian government. Italy has long been calling for reform of the rules governing which EU member state is responsible for examining an asylum application – known as the Dublin III Regulation. It also appeased the Visegrád Group of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, which has long been against any mandatory refugee relocation quotas among EU member states.
In spite of the fact that arrivals into the EU from the Middle East and Africa have seen a huge drop off since 2015, the plan to build controlled centres is yet another confirmation of how EU migration policy is driven by emergency solutions. This has led to unorthodox, if pragmatic, fudges rather than a considered legal response. It highlights the inability of the EU legislature to reform a system that has long been in need of substantial change.
Hotspots in all but name
It remains unclear what controlled centres would look like, where they will be set up and who will pay for them. The application of the principle of solidarity also remains vague.
An EU official close to the French government said that they would resemble the ""hotspots"" that were set up in Italy and Greece in 2015. These reception centres were meant to constitute facilities for the first reception, registration and initial processing of migrants at the ""external borders"" of the EU within 48 hours of arrival – or a maximum of 72 hours.
A 2016 report by the European Council on Refugees and Exiles highlighted how the hotspots introduced greater ambiguity, making it difficult to distinguish whether a person was actually being detained or not. Since March 2016, new arrivals in Greece have no longer been allowed to leave for the mainland but instead must lodge their asylum application at the hotspots.
Relocation in the EU is no longer an option as many EU member states refuse to accept people crossing into their territory who have arrived elsewhere within the EU. A new deal struck on July 2nd in the wake of the EU summit between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her interior minister and coalition partner, Horst Seehofer, illustrates the current state of affairs.
Under this deal, Germany will establish transit centres close to the border with Austria where asylum seekers already registered in another EU member state will be processed before being returned to that country where possible. Where that isn’t possible, the asylum seekers will be sent back across the border to Austria. But the Austrian government quickly warned that it was prepared to ""take measures"" to protect its southern borders, particularly with Italy and Slovenia, if the German proposals are implemented.
There are still more migrants arriving at the hotspots in Greece and Italy than leaving. They are seriously overcrowded with very poor and, in some instances, appalling standards of living, particularly for unaccompanied minors. The Moria camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece is a case in point: built to receive 1,800 people it ended up housing more than 6,000 migrants and asylum seekers.
Migrants are often detained without a court order, forced to be fingerprinted and classified as asylum seekers or irregular economic migrants on the basis of a summary assessment. Due to a lack of interpreters, the new arrivals have very little understanding of what is happening and the procedures available to them.
NGOs have highlighted how people are often classified solely on the basis of their nationality. For example, migrants from Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are often classified as economic migrants.
A lack of transparency and proper monitoring has meant people are denied access to asylum procedures. Those – often arbitrarily – classed as irregular economic migrants can face enforced rejection or mass expulsion, raising profound human rights concerns.
Preserve basic human dignity
Like the hotspots before them, the new ""controlled centres"" leave the Dublin asylum rules untouched. But there is a key lesson to be learnt: the new centres will need to guarantee access to adequate asylum procedures, unlike the hotspots. As the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, emphasised in a statement about the proposals, people will also need to be housed in dignifying living conditions.
Denying people their human rights challenges their very humanity and goes against the core of their human dignity. Every human possesses an innate worth, just by being human, which needs to be respected and protected.
Fears that the proposed controlled centres will be ""old wine in new bottles"" are real. More durable solutions based on the rule of law need to be urgently ironed out by the EU legislature in the future.

					08:56 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Salvini says Aquarius migrant ship on a 'cruise',"Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini suggested Thursday that hundreds of migrants aboard a rescue convoy heading for Spain were on a ""cruise"", as an NGO condemned their plight as a symbol of the failure of the EU.
The Aquarius boat, accompanied by two Italian vessels, is making its way across the Mediterranean to Valencia after Italy and Malta refused to allow it to dock at their ports over the weekend.
But on Thursday, huge waves and strong winds forced the convoy, carrying 629 rescued migrants, to take a detour along the coast of the Italian island of Sardinia.
Asked by a journalist whether the ship would arrive in Spain, Italy's new far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini said: ""Of course, it's not as if they can now decide where to start and finish the cruise.""
""It seems to me that their arrival is expected Saturday without problems,"" he added.
French charity SOS Mediterranee said Thursday that the Italian coast guard vessel guiding the Aquarius ship had decided to divert the convoy north along the east coast of Sardinia to bypass four-metre (13-feet) high waves and winds of 35 knots (65 km/h).
The move was to ""protect itself from the otherwise unbearable bad weather for the people on board, who are exhausted, suffering from shock and seasickness,"" the NGO said on Twitter.
Symbol of failure
Doctors without Borders (MSF) coordinator Aloys Vimard, who is on board the boat, tweeted: ""Most people are inside lying on floor including pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, babies, burns patients, people who almost drowned.""
The majority of the migrants are from Africa, while several others come from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, according to MSF.
The head of the Spanish branch of MSF David Noguera condemned the EU for a lack of coordination.
""The detour of the Aquarius is clearly a symbol of the failure of the European Union and European governments with their contradictory policies,"" he told AFP by telephone from Barcelona.
""It is a very negative precedent. The truth is there is a question on the table as to whether this is a single event which is resolved quickly, or if we will no longer be allowed to dock in Italy and the blockage continues which would completely change rescue operations.""
The plight of the Aquarius has again highlighted the failure of EU member states to work together to deal with the influx of migrant arrivals since 2015.
But the French foreign ministry on Thursday said it was ready to welcome migrants aboard Aquarius who ""meet the criteria for asylum"" after they arrive in Spain.
Salvini has vowed to stop foreign boats carrying migrants from arriving in Italy, a policy that has also affected a US military ship.
The Trenton rescued 40 migrants off the coast of Libya on Tuesday and was still waiting for instructions on where it could dock on Thursday, the US Navy said.
It added that during the rescue operation ""the crew initially observed approximately 12 bodies in the water that appeared to be unresponsive,"" but said that they ""prioritised recovering those who needed immediate help"".
'Isolated and vulnerable'
As well as tension between Malta and Italy over who was responsible for helping the Aquarius rescue ship, another row erupted this week when French President Emmanuel Macron accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"".
Italy's new economy minister shelved a meeting with his French counterpart in Paris on Wednesday as a result of the dispute.
However, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Thursday he believed the row had been resolved after a phone conservation with Macron and the pair are set to meet Friday in Paris for talks.
On Thursday Pope Francis called for ""assistance from the entire international community"" to help ""isolated and vulnerable"" migrants.
""In order to acknowledge and respond to the current migration situation, the assistance of the entire international community is needed, since its transnational dimension exceeds the capacities and resources of many States,"" said Francis in a message to participants at a conference on international migration at the Vatican.
The contentious issue of how to deal with migrants is expected to dominate an EU summit at the end of June."

The Diciotti ship arrived at the port of Catania and the migrants began to disembark, an AFP photographer saw.
An official in the Catania coastguard told AFP there were more than 900 migrants, who were saved in multiple rescue operations off the coast of Libya.
Italy's new populist government came under fire on Tuesday from its EU neighbours after refusing to let a foreign rescue boat carrying 629 migrants dock in Italy. The migrants aboard the Aquarius, run by French NGO SOS Mediterranee, were stuck on the overloaded ship as Italy and Malta bickered over who should take them, until Spain stepped in and said the migrants could land at the port of Valencia.
The Aquarius was heading for Spain on Wednesday, escorted by two Italian vessels that between them had taken more than 500 of the passengers aboard.

Italy's new interior minister Matteo Salvini insisted on Tuesday that the country's ports would no longer be open to foreign boats carrying migrants. He has repeatedly accused charities of working with human traffickers, but said Italy would not stop rescuing migrant boats itself.
""We have put a stop to the NGOs. The coastguard and navy can continue to save lives, but other countries need to keep giving us a hand,"" he said.
On Wednesday Italy summoned the French ambassador after France's President Emmanuel Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" over its refusal to let the Aquarius dock.
Speaking to the senate, Salvini said ""he hoped for an official apology as soon as possible"" from France.
Salvini, the head of the anti-immigration League party, has repeatedly vowed to stem the flow of migrants to Italy, which has seen more than 700,000 arrive on its shores since 2013.
Under EU rules, migrants must apply for asylum in the European country where they first arrive. That has put pressure on Italy and Greece, the entry points for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty.

German NGO Sea-Watch said in a statement that their boat Sea-Watch 3 was held until gone midnight on Saturday after arriving at the port at Reggio Calabria with 232 people onboard.
Italian police questioned the boat captain for more than four hours, according to the NGO, and journalists travelling on the vessel were asked to hand over video footage of the rescue operation, which took place on June 5th.
""The political attacks against us are not only endangering us, but those in maritime distress,"" the NGO tweeted. ""After 12 hours stuck in port, without a comprehensible reason given by the authorities, while there were 6 SAR-Cases on the Mediterranean Sea, we finally set sails to SAR.""
SAR stands for search and rescue operations.
Sea-Watch said police also questioned some of the rescued migrants from the boat. After being processed by the authorities they are likely to end up in migrant reception centres.
The holding of the boat comes after Italy's new anti-immigrant government pledged to slow down landings and speed up expulsions of migrants illegally in the country.
""If anyone thinks I won't move a muscle while we have another summer of landings, landings and more landings, well that's not what i'm going to do,"" said new Interior Minster Matteo Salvini from the far-right League party on Saturday.
Sea-Watch said it had requested help from the coastguard in Malta to send boats to aid the rescue mission last week but Malta refused.
Salvini has previously lambasted neighbouring Malta for not doing more to help deal with would-be asylum seekers -- a charge Malta has denied.
While Sea-Watch 3 was being held in Reggio Calabria, fellow NGO SOS Mediterranee rescued 629 people in six separate night-time operations in the Mediterranean.
The French organisation said that of those saved and brought on board its ship Aquarius on Saturday night, 123 are unaccompanied minors, 11 are small children and seven are pregnant women.
They are currently heading north in search of a secure port at which to dock."

In response, a group of artists launched the 'only in postcards' campaign with the goal of raising awareness about migrant deaths at sea and the work of rescuers. The young creatives plan to send 10,000 postcards to the interior ministry and have called on artists and illustrators to submit their own designs.
""Rescuing those who risk dying at sea is a priority and a duty, regardless of political position. Hindering rescue operations is a human rights violation that can not be ignored,"" the campaigners said in a statement.

Typical cheery postcard graphics and messages, such as 'Saluti da Pozzallo' (greetings from Pozzallo) and 'Wish you were here' accompany images of migrants aboard flimsy dinghies or other reminders of the treacherous journey. The cards have been designed in different styles, from vintage-style graphics with crosses representing the graves of those who die at sea, to photographs of crowded boats and children in life jackets.

Salvini, who has used the Trump-inspired slogan 'Italians first' as his rallying cry, has announced that Italian ports would be closed all summer to NGO ships carrying rescued migrants. Italy's coalition government, made up of the League and Five Star Movement, has set a goal of zero migrant arrivals by sea.
Italy has called on its EU neighbours to share the migration burden by accepting some of those rescued, and on Sunday 450 rescued migrants disembarked at a Sicilian port following offers from five other countries to take in 50 people each. The interior ministry has also prevented a private Italian ship from docking with migrants on board.
Salvini said the ""next objective"" would be to send all rescued migrants back to Libya and on Monday morning called for Europe to recognize Libya as a safe port for migrants.
NGOs however have highlighted reports of abuse and rape in Libyan holding centres, and rights group Amnesty International has accused European governments of being ""complicit"" in this abuse.

But two years with hundreds of asylum seekers packed into overcrowded centres dubbed ""human warehouse"" are taking their toll -- on both migrants and villagers.
Inside vast white tents erected in a former military zone on the outskirts of the tiny village of Conetta, some 1,400 men from across Africa while away their days, packed onto endless rows of bunks as the temperatures rise.
Many escape for a few hours to cycle around the area: they are met with hostile banners calling for them to leave.
""I used to call this place a modern lager,"" Cona mayor Albero Panfilio told AFP, referring to concentration camps. The commune of Cona includes the little village of Conetta.
""After two years this is (still) a place where human beings are squashed in together, with no hope for the future. Now I call it a human warehouse. The migrants arrive, they don't know where to put them, they have a warehouse, they dump them here.""
The asylum seekers were treated ""like garbage"", he added.
Panfilio says the 190 residents in Conetta have also suffered. Among several protest messages scrawled on sheets and hung up in the village square, one reads simply ""Repatriate the migrants"".
'Lots of hostility'
Around 10 kilometres away (6.2 miles) in Bagnoli di Sopra, some 700 migrants are crowded into another former military base. There are more barbed wire fences among the endless fields of soybean and corn, and no access to journalists.
Mayor Roberto Milan said the residents there had held sit-ins demanding the migrants be removed, but to no effect.
""The tension is great, there's a lot of hostility. There are many of them and it's not possible to create ties (with the local population). That leads to mutual distrust,"" he told AFP by telephone.
""They come, they go, they ask for money,"" he said.

Moussa Bamba, a 31-year old from the Ivory Coast, said he would ""pay a price"" for speaking out about conditions inside the Conetta camp, but pleaded for authorities to allow them to use their time profitably.
""I ask for one thing, training: teach us some skills while we wait here. To be a bricklayer, electrician, mechanic. To allow us to integrate if we stay, or return having learned something,"" he said.
Over 85,000 people have been brought to safety in Italy so far this year after being rescued in the Mediterranean as they attempt the perilous crossing to Europe. Many are fleeing horrors in crisis-hit Libya.
What has been described as the worst migrant crisis since World War 2 began in earnest in 2014, when 170,000 people landed in Italy. Europe forced Italy to close its borders in 2015 to prevent people travelling onwards.
Since then, the number of people blocked in the country has risen sharply, along with requests for asylum, which jumped from 63,500 in 2014 to 123,000 in 2016. Those filing the requests can wait up to two years for a result.
In the meantime, humanitarian organisations like the Red Cross warn that the conditions in the reception centres are deteriorating.
'We need you'
Guinean Kaba Aissata Mohamed, a 33-year old who worked as a journalist back home, said he and the others inside want nothing more than to be treated like human beings and allowed to join society.
""We need you, we need the local population,"" he said. ""The local residents should at least be aware of our existence. We want to live with you, with the world outside (the camp), that's what's important.
""But here we are hemmed in, we are isolated,"" he added.
Italy's centre-left government has promised to redistribute migrants so small towns do not feel overwhelmed. But so far, little has been done.
""What's going to happen in the future if they continue to arrive?"" asks local Pietro Grapeggia as he watches the young men peddle past on their round-trips to nowhere.
""They are good kids, well behaved, strong, full of energy,"" said the 75-year old.
""You see them wasting away their days going around on their bicycles, it doesn't seem very normal to me.
""And when the government stops paying to look after them, then what will they do?""

					12:20 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Italian police detain man suspected of shooting migrant worker dead,"Police in southern Italy have detained a local man who they suspect of shooting and killing a West African immigrant while he collected scrap metal, in a case that has highlighted the dire conditions faced by the region's thousands of migrant workers.
The suspect, named as Antonio Pontoriero from San Calogero in Calabria, is suspected of firing a shotgun on three Malian men as they scavenged for metal at an abandoned factory on Saturday night, hitting one of them in the head. That man, 29-year-old Soumaila Sacko, died from his injuries.
Pontoriero had been under investigation for several days but was taken into custody after police judged that he might try to flee, prosecutors said on Thursday.
Detailed descriptions provided by the survivors soon led to investigators to the 43-year-old, whose uncle had a stake in the former brick factory before it closed. The site was subsequently seized by police, who accuse several people, including Pontoriero's uncle, of illegally dumping hazardous waste there.
Pontoriero now faces charges of homicide and illegal possession of a firearm.
Despite early speculation that the shooting was racially motivated, police are not treating Sacko's death as a hate crime. Forensics and ballistics experts are still studying the trajectory of the four bullets fired, which will help investigators determine whether or not the shooter was aiming to kill.

Sacko, who had permission to live and work in Italy, had been in the country since 2010 and was active in a grassroots trade union that campaigns for migrants' working rights. He and his companions lived in a tent city a few kilometres from the factory where he died, a sprawling shantytown that has been called ""one of the biggest ghettoes in Italy"".
It houses many of the several thousand migrant labourers who pick southern Italy's crops, often working for miserable wages and living without permanent shelter, electricity or running water.
After Sacko's death, his USB trade union called a one-day strike on Monday and activists joined migrants in a march through San Ferdinando, the town on the outskirts of which the tent city sprang up. The encampment is the result of violence between locals and migrants in early 2010, prompting many workers to flee.
Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte included Sacko in his first speech to parliament this week, calling him ""one of thousands of day labourers with correct immigration papers who every day in this country go to work in conditions below any level of dignity"".
But his deputies, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and Labour Minister Luigi Di Maio, were criticized for failing to comment on the case. As their opponents noted, Sacko was killed just hours after Salvini, a member of the anti-immigration League party, declared: ""The party's over for illegals.""

The Vos Thalassa remains in the Mediterranean, while the people onboard were transferred into the coast guard's care on Tuesday after their behaviour put the tugboat's crew at risk, according to Italian Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli.
The situation reportedly became dangerous when the rescued migrants were told they might be handed over to the Libyan coast guard, Repubblica reported.
Toninelli granted permission to the Italian coast guard to disembark the 67 people in Trapani, Sicily, despite objections from Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who was the one to deny entry to the Vos Thalassa.

""I will not authorize the disembarkation unless I have guarantees that the delinquents – because they're not refugees – who violently hijacked a ship will spend some time in jail and then be taken back to their countries,"" Salvini told the media.
""For the moment, no port"" for Diciotti, he said, even though the ship was expected to reach Sicily by around 5 pm.
The incident has caused tension between Salvini, head of the hard-right League party, and Toninelli, a member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). The two parties share power in a coalition government that is led by the M5S, but has seen its immigration policy dominated so far by Salvini's hardline statements on arrivals by sea.
""It's unthinkable for an Italian ship to be turned away from an Italian port,"" commented the leader of the M5S, Luigi Maio, who along with Salvini is Italy's joint deputy prime minister.
Salvini met Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of the M5S on Wednesday and agreed on ""a common line"", according to the interior minister: ""to reinforce the safety of Italian citizens"" by insisting at an upcoming EU summit with Germany and Austria that Italy not be left to deal with migrant arrivals alone.

After years in which hundreds of migrants were housed for long periods often in squalid conditions, the building was turned into an identification centre where migrants, in theory, spend just a few days before being transferred.
Those rescued at sea are now mostly taken directly to Sicily: in 2017, Lampedusa – which lies closer to North Africa than to Italy – only received 9,000 of the 119,000 migrants that arrived on the country's shores.

Many of them were Tunisians, arriving in such vast numbers that the systematic repatriation agreement in place with Tunisia could not keep up. Italian authorities have preferred to keep the new arrivals on the island in the hope of repatriating them, rather than losing sight of them on the mainland.
Several protests have broken out in recent months as migrants lashed out at prolonged waiting times. Last week a protest ended in an arson attack which left part of the centre in ruins.
Burnt walls, rubbish-strewn corridors, foam mattresses without sheets and squalid toilets without doors, could be seen in photos taken by a fireman which circulated in the Italian media.

Even before the fire broke out, several associations had denounced the living conditions of the 100 or so migrants living in limbo in the centre, some of whom had been there for months.
On Tuesday, the Italian Red Cross threatened to end its activities in the centre if measures were not taken to ensure the safety of the migrants and the staff.
Hours later, the mayor of Lampedusa, Salvatore Martello visited the interior ministry in Rome, where a ""temporary"" closure of the centre, with no fixed end date, was decided.
Migrants will be moved quickly to other centres while ""restructuring work takes place, starting with the fence, the canteen and the video surveillance,"" the ministry announced in a statement.

Just before dawn on October 3rd, 2013, a boat from Libya carrying over 500 migrants sank off the tiny Italian outcrop. Fishermen and rescuers managed to pull only 155 survivors from the water, along with 366 bodies. The images of the coffins lined up in an airport hangar shocked the world and prompted rescue operations in the Mediterranean off Libya.
It was not the island's only encounter with death: boats bringing migrants to safety also carried body bags. The cemetery filled up, while its famous beaches began to empty.

But while the number of vessels attempting the perilous crossing multiplied between 2013 and 2017, increasingly few landed on Lampedusa, a 20 square kilometre island with just 6,100 inhabitants that lies closer to Africa than Europe. Rescued much further south, migrants either stayed fleetingly in Lampedusa's reception centre or were taken directly to Sicily or the Italian mainland.
The locals have leapt at the chance to restore the island's reputation as a holiday paradise, revamping hotels, vacation rentals and restaurants and widening offers of boat trips to discover hidden caves, scuba diving spots and friendly dolphins.
Now, even at the close of the season, it is hard to find a place to lay your towel on Rabbit Beach, a cove of white sands and crystalline waters fewer than 600 meters from where the 2013 shipwreck still lies.
""Why go to the Maldives when you have beaches like this here?"" says pensioner Marzia Davoli, 66, on holiday from central Italy.
There has been a boom in arrivals at the island's new airport, with numbers jumping from 86,000 in 2014 to 128,000 in 2017, and another 3.5 percent on top of that over the first eight months of this year.

'World's most beautiful sea'
""I can guarantee we have the most beautiful sea in the world,"" said Gaspare Natozi, 50, who runs a little beach shop near the only town.
Banker Argentino Sarto, 55, from Monza in northern Italy, is delighted, telling AFP ""the sea is fantastic, the beaches too. The people are very nice and, to be honest, I've seen many more migrants in Monza than here"".
Where locals once poured their energies into helping their dispossessed guests, the challenges they face are now tourism-based: some rather tatty hotels, ageing rental vehicles and overcrowded beaches.
The reception centre is still there. Much of it has been closed since March for renovations, but there are 95 places open and regularly occupied.
But since the withdrawal of both humanitarian and military rescue vessels off the coast of North Africa, arrivals directly from Libya have resumed. Over 2,500 migrants have reached the island since the start of the year, mostly from Tunisia. Last week, a boat from Libya carrying 65 people from Eritrea, Somalia and Morocco landed here after a three-day crossing.

But while locals once pulled people from the water and fed them hot meals, the mood has now changed.
In a sign of the times, ex-mayor Giusi Nicolini, who won the Unesco Peace Prize in early 2017 for her efforts with migrants, came third in the municipal elections last year, losing to the president of the fishermen's consortium, Salvatore Martello. Perhaps most tellingly, the anti-immigration League celebrated a breakthrough, pocketing six percent of the vote.
No longer welcome
Puffing on a cigar in his office, Martello accuses Tunisians -- who since 2017 have once more been arriving here in larger numbers -- of committing petty crimes.
""If Lampedusa receives delinquents instead of people in need, fleeing war, then it is no longer a matter of welcome, but of public order.""
Amin, 35, a Tunisian who arrived a couple of weeks ago, complained that new arrivals are all tarnished with the same brush. ""Here people are a little suspicious, but I heard that there were Tunisians who created problems before us.
""If you come to someone's house, you should show respect,"" he said.
Standing on the steps of the church at dusk, he smiles as he watches an improvised game of football between migrants and local youngsters. ""It's Lampedusa 0, Tunisia 1...""
But when the ball soars across the street to a supermarket, four plainclothes policemen intervene, and the match ends.

					02:55 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Protesters rally around migrant-supporting Italian mayor,"Saturday saw protesters gather in Riace – a small hamlet in Italy's deep south which has earned praise for its integration of migrants – demanding the release of their leftist mayor.
Domenico ""Mimmo"" Lucano was placed under house arrest on Tuesday under suspicion of arranging ""marriages of convenience"" for immigrants and for allegedly skipping a tender process while awarding a garbage management contract to co-operatives with ties to migrants.
In office since 2004, Lucano has made headlines around the world for welcoming migrants to the sparsely-populated village in Calabria in a bid to boost jobs and development.
""Keep strong, continue fighting,"" his supporters chanted Saturday as they gathered outside his window from where he raised a fist in support.
In addition to the charges of aiding and abetting illegal immigration to Italy, Lucano is also accused of misconduct for allocating contracts for the town's waste collection service to two social cooperatives without a public tender; but additional charges of embezzlement, fraud against the state, and bribery have already been dropped, according to La Repubblica.
The main charge arising from the investigation known as “Operation Xenia”, led by the public prosecutor for Locri and carried out by Italy’s Financial Police, centres on claims that Lucano falsified documents and facilitated sham marriages so that migrants could obtain permits to remain in Italy.
Police say they intercepted a conversation in which the mayor can be heard conspiring to obtain residency for a Nigerian girl who has been denied status in Italy by printing her an ID card listing her as resident in Riace, and advising his interlocutors to have her married as soon as possible to an Italian citizen.
“To disobey these crazy laws I go against the law,” he reportedly says during the conversation.
Lucano and his partner Tesfahun Lemlem have been placed under house arrest.
Riace, a small town in the Calabrian “toe” of Italy’s boot, has in recent years become a symbol of refugee hospitality in Europe and has drawn international attention for the “Riace model”, whereby migrants are given free housing in the town’s abandoned homes, and money allocated by the Interior Ministry is given to social cooperatives which provide the migrants with job training and a small salary.
In 2016 the mayor was profiled in Fortune Magazine's list of the World's Top 50 Leaders for his role in devising the novel system."

The March 4th general election saw parties promising mass expulsions of illegal immigrants make big gains, but in reality little will change for those huddled in the campsite. Their makeshift homes have been provided by the Baobab Experience, a volunteer organization which has been working with migrants since 2015 despite repeated evictions and police confiscating their materials.
Kicked out of their original home in an old glassworks near Rome's Tiburtina train station just before Christmas 2015, Baobab's present shelter for migrants is a campsite that is under constant threat.
""We have already been evicted more than 20 times,"" coordinator Andrea Costa told AFP. ""We often say in Italy that there's no limit to how bad things can get. But I wonder what could be worse than a tent camp.""
READ ALSO: Understanding the Italian election result, and what happens now?
More than 690,000 migrants, most from Sub-Saharan Africa, have arrived in Italy by boat from Libya since 2013. Migration study foundation ISMU estimates that around 500,000 -- 0.9 percent of the population -- are living in the country illegally.
No surprise
Baobab says that since 2015 it has worked with more than 70,000 migrants, of whom 95 percent want to leave Italy. Many come to them after leaving Italy's asylum reception system, either in an attempt to move north or because their asylum application has failed.
But those who are trying to stay in the country don't expect much to change.

Patrick, a 29-year-old undocumented Nigerian, has been in Italy for four years after arriving via Libya, and has remained despite his asylum application being rejected. He splits his days between his shared apartment on the outskirts of Rome, Italian lessons and begging outside a supermarket in a wealthy area of the city.
The election result, which saw a right-wing coalition headed by far-right, anti-immigrant iconoclast Matteo Salvini win the largest share of the vote, did not surprise him.
""Most Italians are racist. This is not news,"" he says. ""People don't let us sit on public transport, or they close their noses as though we smell bad. If there are only black people waiting at a bus stop, often the bus doesn't even stop.""
'They must stay'
However the promise of the right and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) -- who finished close behind the right -- to expel hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants is a hard one to maintain, given the reluctance of the migrants' countries of origin to take them back.
Despite a major effort from the outgoing government led by the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), just 6,514 people were repatriated in 2017, and that was a 12 percent increase on the previous year. The right's rhetoric has it that the PD has allowed an ""invasion"" to happen, but that same government has also cracked down on arrivals after controversial agreements with Libyan authorities and militias that has cut the number of people landing on Italian shores by 70 percent since last summer.

Despite an increase in anti-migrant sentiment, there is some resistance to the idea of sending them all back, as Salvini and is allies would like. Stefano Calabro, the left-wing mayor of tiny Sant'Alessio in Aspromonte in the southern region of Calabria, has seen his village reborn with public funds, jobs and services that have arrived thanks to the migrant reception system.
His village has 330 inhabitants and welcomes about 30 to 40 asylum seekers and refugees for six-month integration programmes that give full-time or part-time jobs to ten locals.
""Italy cannot do without good reception centres,"" he says.
Luigi De Filippis, president of the Coopisa association which manages migrant reception in Sant'Alessio in Aspromonte and other nearby villages, says that even the people who voted for M5S or the League don't want to see the migrants leave.
""People say to me 'we must send the migrants home. But not the ones in the village, we know them and they should stay',"" he said.

Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini – who has vowed an uncompromising stance on the issue – paid a surprise visit to Libya on Monday. He called for processing centres to be set up in various unnamed African countries to deal with potential migrants in a move ""to help Libya as well as Italy block migration"".
Similarly, France has proposed setting up EU asylum processing centres in Africa aimed at discouraging people to attempt dangerous trips.
Libya is a key departure point for thousands of refugees and migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the perilous crossing over the Mediterranean in often rickety boats. Its coastguard said it had rescued nearly 1,000 people on Sunday, and Spanish authorities said they had picked up more than 600 others on Monday.
Salvini's visit came a day after emergency talks in Brussels between 16 EU leaders in a bid to break a longstanding deadlock over who should take in the migrants, the bulk of whom have been landing in Italy and Greece. A full summit is scheduled for Thursday and Friday.
EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos on Monday urged European nations to work together, saying: ""It's a moment of great responsibility.""

EU deals with Turkey and Libya, the main transit countries, have sharply cut, at least for now, the flow of migrants to Europe since a 2015 peak of over one million.
The current row came to a head earlier this month when Italy's new populist government turned away the Aquarius with 630 people on board. Salvini warned foreign charities to stop rescuing migrants off Libya, accusing them of ""causing trouble"" and saying Italian ports ""are and will be closed to those who aid human traffickers"".
The war of words saw French President Emmanuel Macron accuse Rome of ""irresponsibility"" for turning away the boats, while Italy denounced Paris for hypocrisy in pushing migrants back across their shared border.
The issue was raised during a meeting at the Vatican on Tuesday between Macron and Pope Francis, who has called for ""solidarity"" with migrants. Giving a bronze medal to Macron, the Pope said it was the ""vocation of those in government to protect the poorest"".
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing an ultimatum from her hardline interior minister who has given her until the end of June to find a European deal to curb new arrivals.

					14:57 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Catholic aid organization: Italy urgently needs more migrant carers for the elderly,"The Sant'Egidio community says Italy needs to raise its quotas for migrant carers from outside the EU if it is to meet the needs of the 3.8 million elderly who live alone in Italy.
In a meeting with Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in Rome, the president of the Catholic aid organization the Sant' Egidio Community called for 50,000 non-EU migrants to be granted work visas by 2019. The current quota is capped at 30,850.
Most of these work permits however are envisioned for seasonal workers in farming and hospitality. There is no quota for carers.
Many women from poorer eastern European economies are currently employed as carers in Italy, although demand outstrips supply, according to experts.
""Caregivers no longer come and this is a problem for the elderly. Without them, without home care or without the creation of alternative forms of co-housing they can no longer stay at home and there is a rising mortality rate,"" Marco Impagliazzo, president of the Sant'Egidio Community, said in a press conference, reports Il Sole 24 Ore.
More than 52 per cent of Italians aged over 85 live on their own – at least 250,000 alone in Rome.
Impagliazzo's plea to recruit more legal migrant workers follows a similar appeal two weeks ago by Tito Boeri, president of Italy's National Institute of Social Security (INPS).
""What we have done in recent years has been to close the door to regular immigration. This condemns us to have only irregular immigration and prevents us from receiving contributions that would be very important,"" said Boeri.
Italy's population has been growing steadily in recent years while the birth rate is declining. Legal migration to Italy is defined by the so-called 'decreto flussi' – the flow decree. While the law's quotas change each year, the legislation has not been updated since 2011 to reflect contemporary needs, according to Sant'Egidio's Impagliazzo.
Care for the elderly was traditionally provided by a family's younger generations but increased social mobility – and internal migration – in recent years has left a gap, which is mainly filled by foreign workers. According to figures cited by Il Sole 24 Ore, 33 per cent of the elderly in Italy need carer support.
While some of that demand is met by EU workers, INPS' president Boeri suggested many more non-EU economic migrants are needed.
La domanda di badanti delle famiglie italiane è in aumento. Ma in mancanza di decreti flussi con quote per badanti il numero di lavoratori domestici extra-comunitari iscritti alla gestione Inps tende a ridursi, non compensato da aumento dei lavoratori comunitari o italiani pic.twitter.com/C7wDMa9Q0g
— Tito Boeri (@Tboeri) July 4, 2018
""The demand for carers of Italian families is increasing,"" tweeted Boeri on July 4th. ""But in the absence of a flow decree with quotas for caregivers, the number of non-EU domestic workers enrolled in INPS' books tends to decrease, not offset by an increase in EU or Italian workers.""

They said about 3,000 people -- mostly Italian, French, German, Dutch and Spanish -- marched from the small Italian town of Ventimiglia the four kilometres to the border with France which has imposed tight restrictions in an effort to turn back an influx of migrants.

Migrant aid groups, which organised the march, said it was to denounce ""the brutality of the national and international policies"" recently adopted as European states seek to halt a fresh influx.
Italy's new right-wing government has cracked down especially hard, refusing permission for several ships carrying rescued migrants to dock in its ports.
Rome has also demanded that its European Union peers do much more to help Italy, which along with Greece has received most migrants, pressing efforts to stop them coming at source.

""France and Malta will respectively take 50 migrants each... other countries will follow very quickly,"" Conte said on his Facebook page on Saturday.
A German government spokeswoman later said in a statement that ""Germany and Italy have agreed that, in view of the ongoing talks on intensified bilateral cooperation on asylum policy, Germany is ready to take in 50 people"".
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte confirmed the deal on Sunday, writing on Facebook that 150 of the 450 migrants had now been accepted and the rest would soon be fairly distributed among other EU countries.
""This is the solidarity and responsibility we have always asked from Europe and now, after the results obtained at the last European Council, it is starting to become reality,"" Conte said.
""Let's continue on this path with firmness and respect for human rights.""
Italy has since Saturday requested that its EU peers take some of the migrants stranded aboard the Frontex ships off the Italian coast.
Earlier, Italy and Malta had been at loggerheads again over whose responsibility it was to offer the 450 migrants on board the two EU Frontex vessels a safe harbour.
Conte said he had spent the day in contact with his 27 EU peers, reminding them that they had agreed at their end-June summit on the need to share the burden of dealing with the migrant influx.
In a letter addressed to European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker and EU President Donald Tusk, Conte demanded others should help and not leave Italy in the lurch.
""In this context which always sees Italy in the frontline of saving lives at sea, I ask you for a clear sign on sharing the responsibility of managing the migrant issue and to envisage the possibility of a port taking in, or to take charge of some of the 450 migrants picked up,"" he said.
There was no immediate confirmation from the French.
The migrants, like thousands of others, had set sail from Libya in a single wooden vessel which was identified early Friday while passing through waters under Malta's jurisdiction.
But Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has authority over the country's ports, on Friday refused to let them dock in the latest demonstration of his no-go stance on accepting more migrants.
Salvini insisted instead that the two Frontex vessels be instructed to ""head south, to Libya or Malta"".
""We need an act of justice, of respect and of courage to fight against these human traffickers and generate a European intervention,"" he said in talks with Conte, according to reports carried by Italian news agencies.
Cited by the Italian media, cabinet sources said Conte was going to push for them to be immediately transferred to other European countries, otherwise they would not be allowed to land.
In an exchange of messages, emails and phone calls on Friday, Rome had pushed Valletta to take responsibility for those on board the wooden boat.
But Malta said the ship was much closer to the Italian island of Lampedusa, and on Saturday, insisted it had respected ""all of its obligations under international conventions"" concerning those rescued at sea.
On Saturday morning, as the two Frontex vessels approached the boat, several migrants threw themselves overboard, prompting immediate efforts to rescue them from the water, Italian sources said.
Eight women and children were taken to Lampedusa for medical treatment.
The latest standoff came just hours after 67 migrants were allowed to disembark from an Italian coast guard ship in Sicily late on Thursday.
Salvini, who took office when Italy's new populist government came to power on June 1st, wants to block any further migrant arrivals by boat and has banned NGO rescue ships from docking in Italian ports, accusing them of aiding human traffickers.
Last month, the French rescue ship Aquarius and the German boat Lifeline, who between them were carrying hundreds of migrants, were forced to divert to Spain and Malta respectively after Italy turned them away.
Italy, Greece and Spain have been on the front line of the migrant crisis, with Europe deeply divided over how to share the burden of the massive influx of people seeking a new life in Europe.
Separately, Spanish rescuers saved more than 340 migrants in the Mediterranean on Saturday.

					08:37 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy says Spain should take 'next four' migrant boats,"Italy's far-right interior minister on Wednesday accused Spain of failing in its commitments to receive migrants, saying it should take ""the next four"" rescue boats after Madrid welcomed one rejected by Rome.
Minister Matteo Salvini targeted Spain with a criticism he had earlier levelled at France, alleging the countries had received only a fraction of the migrants they had agreed to take under a European Union deal.
Spain ""can therefore receive the next four boats"" of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean, Salvini told a press conference.
Salvini drew criticism from France last week for refusing to open Italy's ports to the Aquarius, a rescue ship carrying 630 migrants. Spain stepped in to receive them instead.

Salvini spoke after a meeting on Wednesday with his Austrian counterpart, Herbert Kickl. Austria's conservative and rightwing coalition government is also taking a hard line against migrants. The country takes over the rotating EU presidency on July 1st.
Salvini took office last month in a populist government formed following elections marked by the migration issue. Italy is one of the main entry points for thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa, and Salvini called for more help from other EU countries to deal with them.
""We ask Europe to provide more men and resources to defend the Mediterranean,"" he said.
Tensions over migration are expected to dominate an EU summit on June 28th.
""If Europe thinks that Italy will continue to be a refugee camp, it is mistaken,"" Salvini said. ""Italy only wants to help Italians.""

					14:20 CEST+02:00				",The Local,Fresh chaos as Italian border town sees new migrant influx,"Authorities in the Italian-France border town of Ventimiglia are struggling to find accommodation for migrants after a spike in arrivals over the last seven days.
More than 300 people arrived in the Ligurian town after making their way up from southern Italy after a week that saw 13,000 rescued at sea.
The spike comes a year after Italy and France became embroiled in a standoff after hundreds of migrants were stranded in Ventimiglia because they were refused entry into France.
With the border still being stringently monitored, just 20 of the 300 migrants who arrived in Ventimiglia have attempted to cross, with the majority now housed in the town's main refugee centre, run by the parish church of San Antonio, where numbers have swelled to over 600.
“The situation has become unsustainable,” parish priest Father Rito Alvarez told San Remo news.
Volunteers at the centre are now preparing 700 meals a day.
“We're trying to welcome everyone, but there are so many and the number keeps growing,” Maurizio Marma, a volunteer from Caritias, the church-run charity, told Ansa.
“Many of them are now sleeping on the floor outside; we are looking for another solution.”
The problems are not just logistical. The spike in arrivals is also creating a headache for guards at the French border.
Although the majority of the arrivals have been identified in Italy and therefore must stay, some have been caught trying to cross the border into France, with a reported 20 migrants being removed from France-bound trains on Monday morning alone.
The sudden influx has also caused sanitation problems inside the refugee centre.
An outbreak of chickenpox last week saw four refugees hospitalized and a further 80 given vaccinations against the disease.
Ventimiglia Mayor Enrico Ioculano is set to meet with religious leaders on Monday in the hope that more Church structures can be freed up for use as welcome centres.
In June last year around 250 migrants camped out in Ventimiglia for four days, protesting that they should be allowed to enter France on their way to their desired destinations in northern Europe.
Italy's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano described the dramatic scenes as “a punch in the face of all European countries that want to close their eyes”. The migrants were eventually forcibly moved.

					17:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy's interior minister refuses to let migrants on coastguard ship disembark,"Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said over 60 migrants on board an Italian coastguard ship that docked in Sicily on Thursday were ""not authorized to disembark"", pending an investigation into a reported mutiny.
The 67 migrants – including women and children – stuck on the Diciotti at the port in Trapani are at the centre of a row after a handful reportedly revolted after their rescue amid fears that they would be returned to Libya.
""I am not giving permission to anyone to disembark from Diciotti: if anyone does so, they will take responsibility for it,"" said Salvini on the sidelines of a summit with his European counterparts in Austria.
Initially picked up by a supply vessel, the Vos Thalassa, over the weekend, the migrants were subsequently transferred to a coastguard ship after staff made emergency calls to authorities in Rome.
According to Italian media, sailors aboard the Vos Thalassa locked themselves in the control room and called for help after two migrants with mobile phones and GPS realised that the boat was heading south back towards Libya, sparking a furious reaction from some on board.
Migrants trying to reach Europe are desperate not to be returned to Libya, where they face abuse and rape in detention centres.

""If there was violence [on board the Vos Thalassa], the perpetrators will go to prison and if there was no violence, because someone lied, then they [those who supposedly lied] will suffer the consequences,"" Salvini – who is also the leader of the hard-right League party – said.
The Diciotti will be blocked ""for as long as necessary"" to clarify the situation, Salvini added.
The nationalist minister – who has authority over Italian ports – initially refused to allow the Diciotti to dock in Italy, despite previously saying that ports would remain open for Italian naval and coastguard ships carrying migrants.
Salvini has banned charity rescue boats operating in the Mediterranean from docking in Italy, accusing them of aiding human traffickers to bring migrants to Europe.
The latest tussle over migrant arrivals comes as 28 interior ministers meet in the Austrian city of Innsbruck for a summit focused on finding a common migration plan as tensions over the contentious issue rise in Europe.
The case of the Diciotti has also highlighted a split within Italy's government coalition, which includes the League and Luigi Di Maio's Five Star Movement, whose left fringe is opposed to the closing of Italian ports.

""The alternative cannot be to resign ourselves to the impossibility of managing migratory flows and hand human traffickers the keys to European democracies,"" Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday the United Nations lambasted the EU's policy – led by Italy – of helping the Libyan authorities intercept migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and return them to ""horrific"" prisons in Libya.
The human rights issue ""is, was and will be a question we will not relinquish, but we know that condemning [abuses] is not enough, we must act,"" Minniti said, without entering into details.
Libya has long been a major transit hub for migrants trying to reach Europe, and many of them have fallen prey to serious abuse in the country at the hands of traffickers and others.
""The suffering of migrants detained in Libya is an outrage to the conscience of humanity,"" the UN said.

But Italy's foreign ministry said that Rome had been calling ""for months"" for those involved ""to multiply actions and efforts in Libya to ensure acceptable and dignified conditions"" in detention centres.
The UN had criticised the international community for turning a blind eye to the horrors endured by migrants in Libya and said it should not pretend the situation could be remedied by improving detention conditions alone.
But Minniti said Italy was doing its part by supporting a project to relocate 1,000 of the most vulnerable migrants from Libya to third countries.
His comments to parliament followed heavy media coverage in Italy of a CNN undercover report on migrants being sold as slaves in Libya.
""These auctions are just a variation of the horror we know,"" former Italian foreign minister Emma Bonino said.

The news comes a day after three babies were found dead and 100 more went missing in a shipwreck off Libya that Proactiva Open Arms, whose charity rescue boat was in the area, said could potentially have been avoided.
It also follows a controversial deal reached by EU member states to stem the influx of migrants. The accord struck Friday includes the setting up of secure centres for migrants in the bloc, ""disembarkation platforms"" outside the bloc and sharing out refugees among member states.
Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms said on Twitter the 59 migrants were now on board their ship ""heading for a secure port"".
""Despite the hurdles, we continue to protect the right to life of invisible people. Their stories on what they experienced (in) Libya are terrifying.""

Italy's hardline Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Facebook that the NGO's boat had reached the migrants' vessel before Libyan coastguards inside Libya's rescue operation zone.
""The nearest port is Malta, the organisation and flag are Spanish: they can forget about coming to an Italian port,"" he added.
Malta's interior minister retorted on Twitter that the migrants had been rescued between Libya and Italy's Lampedusa.
""Stop spreading incorrect information by pointing the finger at Malta without any reason,"" Michael Farrugia said.
In the end, the NGO said they had been given authorisation to dock in Barcelona, adding they would arrive on Wednesday.
Italy's new populist government and Malta earlier this month refused to let dock French NGO rescue ship Aquarius carrying 630 migrants. The move triggered an international outcry before Spain stepped in to help.
Malta then let another charity rescue boat, Lifeline, dock with 230 migrants aboard.
Proactiva Open Arms also accused coastguards in the area of hindering their work as countries such as Italy take a hardline stance against the arrival of migrants.
The NGO said Friday's shipwreck could potentially have been avoided as the official call for help from Italy's rescue control centre only came one hour after Open Arms overheard an EU plane warning Libyan coastguards that a migrant boat was in trouble."

After Salvini wrote on Facebook about the non-government organisation's cargo of ""human flesh"", the NGO responded: ""Dear Matteo Salvini, we have no meat on board, but humans.""
""We cordially invite you to convince yourself that it is people we have saved from drowning. Come here, you are welcome!"" said the charity's reply.
The Lifeline rescue vessel Sunday remained in limbo west of Malta, with 239 people aboard, including 14 women and four infants, who were rescued near the Libyan coast, said the group.
They had received food and water from Malta, and medical supplies and blankets provided by two other German rescue ships, the Sea-Eye and Sea-Watch, said Mission Lifeline spokesman Axel Steier.
Lifeline said it was also hoping to rendezvous in the waters off Malta with Danish container ship Alexander Maersk, which had rescued 113 migrants off southern Italy.
The larger cargo ship could provide some protection to the smaller Lifeline in case of bad weather, while the rescue ship could help with its on-board medical facilities, he said.
Salvini two weeks ago turned back another rescue vessel, the Aquarius of French group SOS Mediterranee, which eventually docked in Spain. The move sparked protests from France and other EU countries and deepened ruptures in the bloc on the flashpoint issue of immigration.
As 16 EU countries were to meet on the issue at a mini-summit in Brussels on Sunday, the German charity expressed hope other European countries may help out.
Steier hoped for ""positive signals"" from the meeting and said ""our hope is that (EU) states offer to take in the people, in solidarity with the concerns of Italy""."

In a message marking the anniversary of the 1956 Bois du Cazier mine disaster on Wednesday, Milanesi reminded people that Italy was once “a nation of emigration”.
The colliery fire in Marcinelle, Belgium, killed 262 people, including 136 Italian migrant workers.
""We have been a nation of emigration, we went out into the world looking for work as foreigners,"" Milanesi said, adding that it was necessary to remember this “when we see the migrants of our troubled age arriving in Europe.”
His message also came after 16 African farm workers were killed in two separate road accidents in the southern Puglia region, where thousands of foreign nationals spend the summer season harvesting tomatoes.
But he was blasted by Riccardo Molinari and Massimiliano Romeo, politicians from the far-right League.
“Comparing Italians who emigrated across the world, who never received gifts or free lunches and dinner in hotels, to the illegal immigrants arriving today in Italy is disrespectful to the truth, history and common sense,” they said.
The smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, also took aim at the minister's comments.
“Italians who emigrated brought work and quality to those who hosted them, and respected the rules,” the party said.
Milanesi, a professor and lawyer, was picked by coalition allies, the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, as foreign minister.
Roberto Fico, the M5S politician and president of the lower house of parliament, has also repeatedly spoken out against the anti-migrant policies of the League. Fico said his party is “different from the League” despite leader Luigi Di Maio and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supporting hardline moves by Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and leader of the League, to stop migrants arriving in Italy.
Millions of Italians, particularly from the south, emigrated between 1870 and 1920 and then again after the second world war until the early 1970s. Today, a lacklustre economy and high unemployment has led to more than a million young people fleeing to other European countries in search of work and better prospects within the last five years."

The Aquarius, chartered by SOS-Mediterranée and Doctors Without Borders (MSF), was informed by the Italian coastguard of the presence of an overloaded boat off the coast of Tripoli, reported the photographer on board the NGO boat.
But Rome also alerted the Libyan coastguard which took charge of coordinating the rescue operation and banned the NGO ship from approaching, also ordering it to move away when migrants jumped into the water to avoid being picked up by the Libyans.
The Libyan navy later announced it had rescued more than 300 migrants in three separate operations, reporting one dead and three missing.
The two victims were with 114 other migrants including 21 women and four children, said a Libyan navy spokesman, General Ayoub Kacem, although he declined to say whether they had been aboard the boat seen by the Aquarius.
And he warned that tensions between the Libyan coastguard and the NGO boats could worsen over coming days if they continued to approach stricken boats.

The Libyan coastguard has previously accused NGOs of causing panic and confusion by their presence during rescues as the migrants all surge to reach the charter boats to avoid being returned to Libya.
But Italian MP Riccardo Magi, who was present on board the Astral, a boat chartered by the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, earlier Sunday when it rescued 105 migrants, accused the Libyans of being heavy-handed.
""The Libyans act as pirates in international waters demanding that they be recognized as an authority. They act outside the law and they do so with the means provided by the Italian government,"" he said on Twitter.

On Saturday, the Libyan coastguard also forced the Astral and another ship to move away from a boat carrying 38 migrants.

The mayor of the hilltop hamlet in Calabria was hounded out of town earlier this week for favouring illegal immigration, but Domenico Lucano has vowed to fight on to protect the way of life here.
He will have to do it from afar as he is banned from Riace, once a ghost town before Lucano, 60, opened the door to migrants and asylum-seekers.
""I'm not going to give up. Riace represents an idea which counters barbarism and we'll go on even without state aid,"" Lucano said in an interview with AFPTV.

Under the programme he started, Riace's abandoned houses were restored, artisan shops were opened and the tourists flocked to see a place where around 400 of its 1,800 inhabitants are foreigners, from Africa to Pakistan and Syria.
But last week the Italian interior ministry ordered the programme shut down after an investigation, which was launched in 2016, uncovered alleged administrative wrongdoing. A judicial inquiry has also raised suspicions of ""marriages of convenience"" for asylum purposes.
Lucano was placed briefly under house arrest, before a court allowed him out but banished him from Riace.
The state had already turned off the tap, withholding the €35 it pays migrant centres daily for each person, affecting roughly a third of the migrant population in Riace.
The bustling alleyways of the village which overlooks the Ionian Sea have gradually become quiet and empty. The shops in the so-called ""global village"" have shut one after another.

Not everyone is as gung-ho as Lucano about soldiering on without the government's subsidies.
""We haven't been receiving money for months now, we are tired and feel abandoned,"" said Rosine, a woman from Cameroon who worked in a textile shop funded by the project and, like other migrants, did not want to give her surname.
""They cut the electricity off because we could not pay and this summer we were finally forced to close,"" she said.
Even though the town's difficulties began before Italy's anti-immigration League joined a coalition government in June, she accuses its head -- interior minister Matteo Salvini -- of wanting to ""stir up trouble over the migrant question"".
Salvini, who has taken a hardline on immigration to Italy, has accused Lucano of seeking to ""replace Italians with Africans"", saying he is ""not the modern hero"" people claim.
The mayor's supporters say that if he broke the law he did so to protect the vulnerable, not for personal gain.

The inhabitants have been living in limbo since his arrest. The air of gloom lifts slightly as volunteers from a neighbouring town arrive with gifts of food, clothes and toys for the youngsters.
Johnjoy, a 35-year old Nigerian, is worried about her four young children. ""The mayor is like a second father to them. What's going to happen to us now he's gone?"" she asked.
Lucano says he still has many cards up his sleeve. ""Over the years we have created structural aids to integration, with projects for organic farming, an oil press and a number of artisan shops,"" he said.
""But what really makes the difference is the solidarity tourism we experienced at the start, attracting people from across Europe to come and spend their holidays here,"" he said.
""It's that type of tourism we need to rekindle.""

Campaign co-founder Michela Locati said they had the idea for the project after Salvini put out a message in late June vowing that NGO migrant rescue ships would “see Italy only in a postcard”, having announced a policy to block the ships from docking on the country's shores.

Locati and her friends Nicole Romanelli, Pietro Gregorini, and Verdiana Festa, who all work in the country's creative industries, put together the campaign within three days and subsequently received more than 300 different designs for political commentary “postcards” from graphic designers and NGOs across the country, after their call to action was publicised by La Repubblica, Ansa, Vanity Fair, and Huffington Post Italia.

The friends travelled across Italy to publicise the campaign, stopping by Bari in the south and Turin and Como in the north, before holding day-long signings in the centres of Italy's two metropolises of Rome and Milan.
The signings were held from 10am until 6pm Sunday outside the Pantheon in Rome and at Piazza Duomo in Milan, timed to coincide with the latter city's “Zero Tolerance” demonstration against racism organized by the Sentinels of Milan.

Speaking at the group's stall outside the Patheon in Rome, local artist Bruna Esposito said she came to sign a postcard after she saw the event advertised in a local online news outlet.
“It looks like a minor initiative but I think this is a very good way for younger people to channel a pacifist message against the increasing brutality and violence, which starts verbal but then becomes physical, against not only immigrants but then the Roma, homosexuals, and the Jewish,” she told The Local.
“It doesn't look like it – you think ah, the Pantheon, there are tourists, it's sunny, there's ice cream, but it's not only that. It's happening again”.

The response wasn't universally positive, however.
“People die all the time!” shouted one woman eating at a restaurant patio on the street when some members of the team went to drum up support with a megaphone.

Gregorini, an art director who created the campaign's website and logo, said he was excited to put out a call to the country's artists and graphic designers because “most of the time creative people don't take a position on political arguments, but we felt it was time to not stay silent anymore.”
“It's a subtle message to say, hey, there are at least 10,000 of us saying what you're doing is not right, just think about that,” he told The Local.
“Italians were mostly emigrants in the last century, sometimes people don't recall that,” he added.
“We also needed to go abroad and find our fortunes.”

					08:58 CEST+02:00				",AFP/The Local,Italy demands new regulations for migrants at tense EU summit,"At a mini EU summit on migration, attended by 16 countries on Sunday, the Italian government proposed a new 10-point plan for dealing with migrations flows in the Mediterranean.
Italy on Sunday called for migrant ""protection centres"" to be set up in several EU countries to relieve overcrowding in its facilities and demanded more aid for African countries that fight human trafficking.
Italy's hardline new government, which has rejected two migrant boats in the past two weeks, complains that Rome has been left alone to rescue tens of thousands of migrants each year in the Mediterranean and process their asylum requests.
In a ten-point plan presented to EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Sunday, Rome proposed greater burden sharing. ""Whoever lands in Italy lands in Europe.....Schengen is at risk,"" says the document seen by AFP, referring to Europe's passport-free zone.
It said the EU's priority should be stemming the influx of migrants into the bloc, not regulating the ""secondary"" movement of migrants across the EU's borders.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel take a different view. Noting that migrant landings in Italy have fallen dramatically this year, Macron said Sunday the main issue was how to distribute asylum-seekers around the union.
Italy said the EU's so-called Dublin rule, whereby asylum seekers are processed in the EU country of arrival, was no longer fit for purpose. ""The rescue obligation cannot become an obligation to process applications
on behalf of all,"" it said.
""Italy and Spain cannot take everyone. Protection centres are needed in several European countries to safeguard the rights of those arriving and to avoid problems of public order and overcrowding,"" it added.
Italy, the main landing point for migrants this year, ahead of Greece and Spain, also called for ""protection centres"" in migrant transit countries in Africa.
Rome also backed calls by France and Spain for EU members that do not accept refugee quotas to face ""financial sanctions"" -- referring to Hungary, Poland and other central European countries.
Italy's new proposal, titled European Multilevel Strategy for Migration, would lead away from an ""emergency approach"" to a more ""structural"" system, said Italy's PM Giuseppe Conte at the meeting.

					08:47 CET+01:00				",AFP,Italy steps up investigation into charity-funded migrant rescue boats,"An Italian prosecutor has stepped up his investigation into charity-funded migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean after claims they are acting as a de-facto taxi service for people traffickers.
Vessels chartered by private organizations are in the spotlight amid accusations they not only encourage traffickers to set migrants out to sea by sailing as close to Libyan waters as possible, but also come to the rescue when the smugglers call.
Prosecutors are looking into how the rescue vessels are funded following questions over the amount of money being spent.
Rescuers say they are forced to patrol near Libya to save lives because the migrants are being loaded into overcrowded dinghies that are so flimsy they are destined to sink shortly after departure.

""It is impossible to rule out direct contact"" between the non-governmental rescue vessels and traffickers in Libya, said Sicilian prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro, who has been leading the probe but has not yet opened an official judicial inquiry.
'Abnormal'
""I am convinced that it is not always the operational centre that calls on the NGOs,"" he told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, referring to the centre in Rome which is supposed to coordinate all rescue operations in this stretch of the Mediterranean.
""It is a question that needs investigation,"" he said, as it would suggest traffickers either on land or onboard the migrant boats may be calling the rescue vessels directly, leaving them open to accusations of complicity.
SOS Mediterranee, which was named by the prosecutor, told AFP it was not in contact with smugglers.
""We do not have any autonomy in terms of operations, we do what we are told to do"" by the Rome operations centre, spokeswoman Amelia Giordano said.
Prosecutor Zuccero said his office was probing the ""abnormal"" level of funds that have allowed even small agencies to deploy ships.
The Maltese organization Moas was the first to launch a private rescue vessel in the summer of 2014.
By last summer close to ten different NGOs, financed mainly through private donations, were taking part in migrant relief operations off Libya.
Those with one or more boats in the area in 2016 included German NGOs Sea Watch, Sea Eye and Jugend Rettet, as well as the Dutch Lifeboat Project, the Spanish Proactiva Open Arms and Moas.
Floodlights acting as beacons
Italian admiral Enrico Credendino, commander of the EU's anti-trafficking operation Sophia, said the NGOs do attract migrant boats, at least in the dark.
""At night they use large floodlights, the traffickers see them and send the dinghies (carrying migrants) towards the lights,"" he said in an interview with the Corriere della Sera daily.
Most of the rescue boats were docked at port through the winter, but the Aquarius - charted by SOS Mediterranee and Doctors Without Borders (MSF) - continued to pull thousands of people to safety, along with the Golfo Azzuro, run by Proactiva Open Arms.
In a report cited in December by the Financial Times daily, the EU's border control agency Frontex raised the possibility that traffickers were putting migrants out to sea in collusion with the private ships that recover them and bring them to Italy ""like taxis"".
The allegation was slammed by MSF as ""extremely serious and harmful"". It said the NGOs were ""not the cause but a response"" to a humanitarian crisis, and had been forced to act because Frontex was failing to prevent migrant deaths at sea.
Despite rough winter seas, the departures from Libya have continued unabated. Over 5,000 migrants have been saved since Sunday, bringing the number brought to Italy since the start of 2017 to over 21,000, a sharp rise on the same period in previous years.

					10:43 CET+01:00				",The Local/AFP,Italy to step up deportations after migrant death protest,"Italy on Wednesday pledged to step up deportations of migrants whose asylum applications have been rejected, following a riot in a northern Italian reception centre which ignited political debate.
The country has been on the frontline of migrant arrivals from across the Mediterranean, and in recent years has struggled to provide accommodation for the thousands of newcomers.
""We have saved many lives but we cannot accept rule-breaking. We need to speed up deportations,"" Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, the country's former interior minister, said in an interview with La Stampa daily.
He was ""working to tie up agreements which will reduce arrivals and prevent departures"" from the coast of North Africa, he said after a record 181,000 people were rescued from the Mediterranean and brought to safety in Italy in 2016.
Clashes broke out over living conditions in the Cona migrant centre in the Veneto region following the death of a 25-year-old woman of a blood clot on Monday. An investigation has been opened into the death of the woman, named by Italian media as Ivory Coast native Sandrine Bakayoko, amid reports that workers at the centre waited several hours before calling an ambulance.
During the protests, asylum seekers set fire to furniture and objects inside the facility, and cut electricity. Italian media reported that 25 staff members had to barricade themselves inside a room overnight, though no injuries were reported.
A parliamentary delegation had visited the centre last November, where over 500 migrants live in the former military base.
The MPs presented a report to the Interior Ministry at the time denouncing ""serious structural deficiencies"", Repubblica reported.
One member of the delegation, Nicola Fratoianni, condemned the poor living conditions including lack of water and light, and and said the centre had been a ""ticking timebomb"".

There had been protests in early 2016, when a small group protested about poor hygiene and sanitary conditions. And a peaceful sit-in was held in August, to protest long waiting times for asylum decisions.
Over 1,400 people were housed in the space originally intended for just 15.
On Wednesday, 100 people were transferred from the Cona centre to Bologna, where they were destined for other facilities.
They were met by a small group of Italian demonstrators holding banners reading: ""Solidarity with those who revolt"".
Political debate
The violence at the centre was condemned by politicians from all of Italy's main parties, with far-right leader Matteo Salvini taking advantage of the incident to call for support.
""When I'm in government, there will be mass expulsions, centre closures, and the navy ships will send people back after saving them,"" the head of the Northern League wrote on Facebook. ""Enough! 2017 will be the year of sending them back.""
MP Marietta Tidei of the Democratic Party responded to Salvini's comments, saying that while the violence at the centre should be condemned, Italians should reject ""the reprehensible exploitation of Matteo Salvini, always ready to fuel a dangerous climate of migrant hatred"".
There were also renewed calls from organizations which work with migrants to restructure the reception centre system, because the so-called 'maxi-centres' are unmanageable.
According to the latest government figures, 175,485 migrants currently live on Italian territory, spread out between reception centres, 'hotspots', and migrant and refugee centres.
A total of 14,669 of those live in temporary accommodation centres (CPA), of which there are seven in Italy, including the one in Cona.
These centres are only designed for migrants to live in for a short period, however the average time spent there has increased throughout 2016, particularly since neighbouring France, Austria and Switzerland closed their Italian borders, making it impossible for many migrants to make their planned journeys on to northern Europe.
Three countries 'key'
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said at least one ""Centre for Identification and Expulsion"" (CIE) will be opened in every region of Italy in the coming weeks, where those who have had their asylum request rejected will be held before deportation.
Returning migrants is a costly, time-consuming process that requires bilateral agreements with the countries of origin. Alfano said three countries were ""key"" to tackling the biggest migrant crisis since World War II: Libya, Niger and Tunisia.
The EU believes just over half the migrants arriving in Italy travel first through Niger and last month it offered Niamey 610 million euros ($635 million) to curb transit towards Europe.
Alfano said Italy was ""close to sealing an agreement"" with the West African country, while Minniti spent Tuesday in Tunisia for talks on ""renewing"" a repatriation agreement between Rome and Tunis.
Italy's police chief Franco Gabrielli vowed at the weekend to deport more migrants who have no right to be in the country following the shooting in Milan of the suspected attacker behind the Berlin Christmas market tragedy.
Tunisian Anis Amri had arrived in Italy by boat in 2011. He spent time in a detention centre and several prisons in Sicily for violent behaviour after Italy tried but failed to deport him back to Tunisia, and was finally ordered to leave the country in 2015.
His return to Italy - where he was shot dead - after the Berlin attack raised fears he was attempting to contact jihadist plotters here.

The protesters marched in silence from the remains of the encampment to the town hall, according to the USB, a union that campaigns for migrant workers' rights and which organized the demonstration.
Some of them held photos of Becky Moses, the 26-year-old Nigerian woman who died in the fire that broke out in the night between Friday and Saturday. Two other women were badly hurt and dozens of others received treatment for less serious injuries, La Repubblica reported.

According to the newspaper, Moses had only been staying in the encampment for a few days before her death. She was previously a resident in Riace, a small town on the other side of Reggio Calabria province that has rehoused refugees from all over the world as part of a widely praised resettlement programme.
However, having recently had her application for political asylum denied, Moses was obliged to leave Riace and had been sleeping instead in a tent in San Ferdinando.

The encampment, on the outskirts of San Ferdinando in an area called Rosarno, is home to around 1,000 people living in tents and shacks. Most of the residents work as labourers on local farms.
The shantytown sprang up after violence broke out between locals, migrants and police in 2010, leaving more than 50 people injured and prompting hundreds of foreign workers to flee the centre of town. Tensions have remained high in Rosarno ever since.

According to the Italian aid group Doctors for Human Rights (Medu), as many as 3,000 labourers – the majority of them with valid residence permits for Italy – live in the camp at the height of the harvest, working for minimal wages and sleeping without electricity or running water in conditions that the NGO describes as “shamefully inhumane”. It calls the tent city “one of the biggest ghettoes in Italy”.
The cause of the fire last weekend is unclear, though smaller blazes in the past have resulted from residents lighting bonfires for warmth.
As a result of Monday's march, USB said, regional authorities have agreed to allow people living in the camp to register as local residents. Anyone whose documents were destroyed in the blaze will also be given an official certificate of loss to help them obtain replacements, the union said."

The arrival of almost 700,000 migrants on Italian shores since 2013 has thrust the issue to the forefront of the election campaign.
Authorities estimate 500,000 people are living here illegally. Many are impoverished or homeless, unable to work or integrate.
Racial tension has risen sharply in the election run-up, emboldening Italy's far-right groups.
Over the past year there have been widespread reports in Italian media of neo-fascists attacking migrants.
Just over a week until the vote, a right-wing coalition headed by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is leading in the polls.
The group, which contains two far-right parties, has promised to stop migrants arriving and deport hundreds and thousands.
""I don't feel safe walking home by myself in the evening anymore,"" says Giuliana, a 48-year-old Esquilino resident (an area of the capital close to the central Termini train station) who would not give her last name.
""I'm not against foreigners, I just want immigration to be controlled. Those with criminal records should be kicked out, but our state has not taken care of this.""

An average of the last major pre-election polls published in Italian media indicated that one in five Italian voters is expected to vote for a far-right party on March 4th.
Not everyone appreciates CasaPound's night-time neighbourhood patrols, however.
""CasaPound is dangerous because their political programme excludes a whole series of people considered 'different' and this leads to divisions in society that are damaging to everyone,"" says local resident Michele Vacca, 32.
""To solve the migrant issue, we need progressive, reformist policies.""
Although polls indicate that CasaPound is unlikely to garner the three percent of the national vote needed to enter Italy's parliament, the group has experienced a series of successes at local level.
They now have local councillors elected in several regions, largely thanks to their grassroots community work to help the poor.
On the other side of Rome, CasaPound has organized a community event at a council estate, dishing up pasta for locals despite the rain.
""Through the help we offer, we have made friends,"" says CasaPound member Alessandro Calvo. ""So we decided to throw a little party to celebrate this friendship.""

Calvo says its network of members distributes food gathered from donations, offers free legal support by volunteers and organises community activities for Italians in need.
The number of Italians living in absolute poverty reached 4.7 million in 2016, according to the national statistics institute (Istat) -- some two million more than when the crisis began in 2008.
Calvo says that the group has seen an increasing number of families approach them for help.
""I'm unemployed. I'm waiting to receive benefits, which is a long process in Italy, and I found myself with absolutely nothing,"" said Ana Maria, a 38-year-old mother who would not give her last name.
""CasaPound gives me food packages and organises events for our children,"" she says, wiping away tears.
""It's really important, they create a sense of community that has been lost.""
Paola Menegat, a local cleaner, says she and others received help and advice from CasaPound.
Now she is an activist for the party.
In her circle, ""originally there were four of us here who wanted to volunteer with CasaPound. Today we could open a committee with over 50 people,"" she says.
CasaPound is like a ""family"" for her, she adds.
""When you are abandoned by the state you have to find the strength to cope on your own,"" she says.

The activists' ""Defend Europe"" mission has been financed by a crowd-funding initiative organised by young anti-immigration campaigners from France, Italy and Germany.
Their 40-metre (130-foot) ship named C-Star, hired by ""Generation Identity"", arrived on Saturday in an area where tens of thousands of migrants have been rescued from unseaworthy trafficker boats over recent months and years.
The boat spent 30-45 minutes tracking the MS Aquarius at a distance of a few hundred metres, before continuing to follow it from further back.
The Aquarius, a converted coastguard patrol boat, is operated by French aid group SOS Mediterranee and the international humanitarian organisation Doctors without Borders (MSF).
Its crew would not comment on whether they regarded the C-Star's proximity as intimidatory. Maritime charts indicated the NGO boat's speed doubled in the time the far-right vessel was close to it.
The two boats were about 20 nautical miles off Libya in an area east of the capital Tripoli.
On its website, the Defend Europe alliance accuses NGOs of ""smuggling hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants to Europe, endangering the security and future of our continent"" and vows to ""do something against it.""
French activist Clement Galant posted a video from the boat on Twitter on August 1st, in which he says the C-Star will accompany any migrant boat it comes across back to the African coast.
The Defend Europe initiative has been denounced by humanitarian organisations as a potentially highly dangerous publicity stunt.

Forcing a migrant boat that had reached international waters back to Libya, where most depart from, would be illegal under international law.
NGO-chartered boats have rescued over a third of the nearly 100,000 people who have been picked up from often distressed trafficker vessels off Libya this year and taken to Italy.
But the involvement of privately-funded boats in an operation mainly conducted by Italian navy and coastguard vessels has become subject to increasing scrutiny.
Critics say the NGOs are making it too easy for the traffickers to guarantee would-be migrants safe passage to Europe, creating a ""pull"" factor at best and operating a taxi service at worst.
Italian authorities last week impounded one NGO boat, the Iuventa, which is operated by German association Jugend Rettet, and accused its crew of being in direct contact with traffickers to organise pick-ups of boatloads of migrants from locations very close to the Libyan coast.

The NGO is challenging the seizure of its boat, saying it wants its crew to get back to saving lives as soon as possible.
Other organisations say they are happy to comply with tighter operational rules set by the Italian authorities but insist they will not give up their missions, saying thousands more people would have drowned but for their presence.
Some 600,000 mainly African migrants have reached Italy from Libya since the start of 2014, leaving the country's asylum facilities stretched and politicians under pressure to end the influx."

					14:44 CEST+02:00				",AFP,The changing face of the Mediterranean migrant crisis,"From waves of dinghies setting off from Libya to the appearance of privately-funded rescue ships, the face of the migration crisis in the Mediterranean has changed greatly over the past few years.
Overcrowding dinghies
Up until 2014, people traffickers took migrants headed for Europe out into international waters on ""mother ships"" before transferring them to smaller boats.
But when Rome launched Mare Nostrum in late 2013, Italy began to catch smugglers in international waters, forcing the criminals to change tactics, stay in Libyan waters and put people out to sea in expendable rubber boats which easily sank.
Their business model changed too. In early 2015 many Syrians - who had previously accounted for about 25 percent of passengers departing from Libya and could afford to pay more for the journey - switched to the Balkan route.

To recover their loses in the central Mediterranean, traffickers upped the number of passengers per vessel. They also largely stopped issuing satellite phones, meaning those in trouble could not call for help.
In 2015 Italy's coast guard registered 676 dinghies - 80 percent of which had a satellite phone on board - carrying an average of 103 people. By 2016 the number of dinghies had risen to 1,094 - with only 45 percent carrying a satellite phone, but each with an average of 122 passengers.
Mass departures stretched rescue resources to the limits: over 13,000 people were saved in five days at the end of May 2016, another 14,000 in four days in August - including a record of 7,000 in one day - and 10,800 at the start of October.
Tragedies bring rescuers
In 2014, about 70 percent of migrants were rescued by the Italian navy and coast guard, and 24 percent by commercial ships. But amid complaints it was serving as a ""bridge to Europe"" for migrants, Italy axed Mare Nostrum.
The safety line was cut, but departures continued, and after two shipwrecks killed 1,200 people in April 2015 the European Union beefed up its Frontex border control's Operation Triton and launched the Sophia anti-smuggling operation.
The tragedies also prompted the launch of privately-funded rescue vessels, with up to a dozen boats taking part at present.

The larger boats combined rescued 26 percent of migrants in 2016, while the smaller ones handed out life jackets and gave emergency care to those in distress while help from bigger vessels arrived.
Italy's navy and coast guard still perform 40 percent of rescues, while the Sophia operation carries out 13 percent and Frontex 7.5 percent, according to the coast guard.
Despite their efforts, over 4,500 migrants died or were missing and feared drowned in 2016, and another 1,000 have met the same fate this year. Some succumb to the cold or dehydration, or are suffocated by fuel fumes, or trapped in overcrowded boats.

A profitable business
In total, nearly 550,000 migrants arrived in Italy between 2013 and 2016, and 37,000 have landed in the country so far this year.

According to Sophia, some Libyan coastal areas derive 50 percent of their income from smuggling migrants. A dinghy with 100 passengers can fetch up to 67,000 euros ($73,000), while a wooden boat with 400 people can earn up to 380,000 euros.
Frontex estimates the business has a turnover of between four and six billion euros.

EU's strategy
The European Union is in the process of training and equipping Libyan coast guards so they will be able to prevent departures or at least stop boats reaching international waters.
So far this year over 4,000 migrants have been intercepted, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
The idea is that they be escorted back to camps in Libya, and then returned to their home countries where possible.
But human rights organizations have said the chaotic situation in crisis-hit Libya makes it impossible to declare it a safe place to return migrants, while many of those fleeing war or persecution cannot be simply returned home.

At the time the US Navy reported seeing around 12 bodies in the water, but were unable to locate them after the rescue.

Matteo Salvini, also deputy prime minister and leader of the nationalist League party, continued the hardline approach to migrants crossing the Mediterranean that has already seen him clash with Malta and other EU nations over a fishing vessel currently taking 450 people towards the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Meanwhile, Valetta said the ship was closer to Italy and those on board wanted to head for its shores.
Last month Malta was forced to take the German NGO boat Lifeline carrying over 234 migrants, just days after a standoff between the island nation and Italy led to the French rescue ship Aquarius being diverted and taking 630 people to Spain.
""As promised, I will not give up. Malta, the smugglers and the do-gooders should know this boat will not land here,"" Salvini said on Facebook.
According to a statement from Italy's foreign ministry the boat, carrying ""minors in urgent need of assistance"", alerted authorities in Rome in the early hours of Friday while travelling in waters which fall under the jurisdiction of Malta.
The ministry claims that Malta took charge of the operation and asked Italy for ""naval help"" while not sending any of its own vessels ""capable of providing assistance"" to the area.
On Tuesday, Italy's transport and infrastructure minister Danilo Toninelli said on Twitter that maritime laws dictate that Malta should send ""its own rescue ships and open its own ports"".
He added that the Italian coastguard would be available to offer support to the island, but that ""Malta needs to do its duty"".
However, the Maltese government claimed that it had ""satisfied all obligations under the applicable international conventions on coordination of Search and Rescue events"".
Spokesman Kurt Farrugia said on Twitter that when Valletta was notified of the ship's presence it was 110 nautical miles from Malta and 53 nautical miles from Lampedusa.
He added that the people on board said that they preferred to go to Lampedusa, and that seeing as the ship was on the high seas, Malta ""did not have the authority to give it instructions"".
Salvini's refusal to allow the ship to dock in Italy comes after the decision Thursday to allow 67 people to disembark an Italian coastguard ship that had docked at the Sicilian port of Trapani after a row that caused friction within the country's anti-establishment coalition government.
The migrants had been held at port as a row brewed over reports that a handful of the group revolted after they were rescued, amid fears that they would be returned to Libya, but were eventually authorised to leave the ship by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte despite the Salvini's insistence that they only be allowed off the vessel ""in handcuffs"".

					09:15 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Aquarius ship arrives in Malta after migrant-sharing deal,"The Aquarius rescue ship arrived in Malta on Wednesday after EU countries thrashed out a deal to take in the 141 migrants onboard, defusing another diplomatic standoff in the Mediterranean.
Loud cheers could be heard from the ship as it pulled into the Grand Harbour in Valletta, five days after the migrants, most of them Somalis and Eritreans, were rescued off Libya. Some flashed peace signs and waved from the deck.
Malta and Italy both initially refused to let the Aquarius dock in a re-run of the standoff seen in June when the vessel was at the centre of a heated diplomatic crisis between European governments.
But Malta on Tuesday agreed to reverse its decision as France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain offered to take in the ship's latest passengers, along with 114 others who arrived on the island on Monday.
The Maltese government said later that Italy had agreed to take some of the migrants but did not say how many.
The Aquarius was allowed to dock despite Malta having ""no legal obligation to (allow it to) do so,"" the government said in a statement later.
The migrants were unloaded from the Aquarius straight onto police buses to be taken to a reception centre, officials said.
Dozens of children were on the ship -- more than 30 of them unaccompanied, according to a Maltese government source -- while two heavily pregnant women were taken to an ambulance.
The Maltese authorities said separately that a military patrol vessel had rescued about 35 migrants on a small boat southwest of the island.
The Aquarius, chartered by French charity SOS Mediterranee as well as Doctors Without Borders, suffered a setback this week when Gibraltar said it would not longer be able to operate under the British territory's maritime flag.
But SOS Mediterranee's German wing said Wednesday that it would likely continue operating under a German flag if the dispute is not resolved.
""The Aquarius of course has the intention and obligation to set sail again as soon as possible, back into the rescue zone off the Libyan coast,"" said the group's Germany chief Verena Papke.

					16:50 CEST+02:00				",The Local/AFP,"One of Italy's largest migrant centres was mafia-run, say police","One of Italy's largest migrant reception centres was in the hands of a mafia clan for ten years, police said on Monday.
A police operation in the early hours of the morning led to 68 arrests, many of whom belonged to the Arena clan, part of the powerful Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta mafia.
The clan reportedly made millions through its involvement in the running of a reception centre for migrants in Isola di Capo Rizzuto, Calabria - one of the largest in the country.
""Over 500 agents overnight arrested 68 people... accused of mafia association, extortion, carrying illegal weapons, fraud, embezzlement to the detriment of the state, (and) theft,"" police in Catanzaro said in a statement.
Their investigation revealed ""that the clan controlled, for profit, the management of the reception centre"" at Isola di Capo Rizzuto - which has held up to 1,500 migrants at a time - and had been doing so for over a decade.

Police arrested Leonardo Sacco, head of the Catholic Misericordia association which officially runs the centre. The 35-year-old has boasted of links to high-powered political figures.
Local priest Edoardo Scordio was also detained in the sting, according to Italian media reports.
Police believe that it was thanks to Sacco that the clan won contracts for supplying catering and other services to the centre, allowing it to syphon of millions of euros of EU funding destined for the migrants' care.
It also provided food services to the reception centre on Lampedusa, the Italian island which for several years was the frontline of the migrant humanitarian crisis, the biggest influx in Europe since World War II.
'Ghost' migrants
The head of the country's anti-mafia commission, Rosy Bindi, said the sting was ""an important result in the fight against the 'Ndrangheta and the infiltration of mafia in the management of migrants"".
About 175,000 people are currently living in reception centres, where the state provides food, clothing, Italian lessons, psychological support, health care and a small amount of pocket money.
Italy's finance ministry has estimated the 2017 budget for migrant reception at three billion euros ($3.3 billion), depending on how many people are rescued in the Mediterranean and brought to the country.
More than 45,000 people have arrived so far this year, a 44 percent increase from the same period in 2016.
The Calabrian centre had long been on the authorities' radar: In 2015 Italy's L'Espresso magazine published an investigative report alleging that managers at the camp were stealing funds earmarked for migrants and making money by starving them.
The Crotone prefecture said in 2014 that it appeared the official number of people recorded at the centre was grossly inflated, with management pocketing funds from the state for ""ghost"" migrants.
L'Espresso said it had got hold of a police report putting the figure at over 10,000 euros a day.
A health inspection in 2013 revealed that asylum seekers were being given miserly portions of out-of-date food, and that the centre was illegally hosting 70 unaccompanied minors who went barefoot and slept in a hangar with only two toilets.
The Arena clan hit the headlines in 2012 after police seized assets from them worth 350 million euros, including one of Europe's largest wind farms.

The crew on the Aquarius ship had rescued 946 people and was travelling to Italy when the mother, Taiwo, went into labour.
Mercy - as the little girl was named - is the fourth baby to be born aboard the Aquarius.
The birth went smoothly and Mercy, weighing a healthy 3.7kg (8 ounces), disembarked in Catania with her mother later on Tuesday. Italian authorities and relief organizations were on hand to assist the rescued migrants.
""Giving birth to a child is one of the most intimate moments in a woman's life, and she had to go through it on a boat surrounded by complete strangers”, said midwife Elizabeth Ramlow, who was aboard the boat.
Monday and Tuesday's rescues came after a busy weekend, which saw over 3,000 people rescued in one day as migrants take advantage of milder weather to attempt the risky crossing.
The total of 947 brought to shore on Tuesday - including Mercy and 200 unaccompanied children - was a record for the Aquarius boat, coming as aid organizations have raised fears that spring could see a further increase in the number of migrant arrivals.

Worsening conditions in Libya are thought to be driving the surge in arrivals, together with fears that the oversea route could soon be closed.
In February, Italy and Libya signed an EU-backed memorandum of understanding under which Italy's coast guard will help train and equip its Libyan equivalent to make it more effective in stopping boats.
But this may have had the immediate effect of encouraging more migrants to make the risky journey, as they fear the Libyan coastguard would simply bring them back to Libya.

""Diciotti ship finally lands in Pozzallo taking 522 people to safe port,"" UNHCR Italy tweeted.
""They were rescued in multiple operations, 42 of them survived drowning and they need urgent medical care and psychological support,"" the UN refugee agency said, adding that it was at the scene along with Italian authorities and humanitarian organisations.
A dozen very dehydrated migrants, including six children, three women and one man, had already been sent to Pozzallo and taken into care by the Italian Red Cross.

It is not known whether they were part of the group of 41 migrants rescued from a vessel in distress off Libya last Tuesday by the USNS Trenton, which transferred them to the Diciotti. The crew of the US fast transport ship also spotted 12 bodies in the water but were unable to locate them during a search after the rescue, the US Navy said.
A nearby ship from the NGO Sea Watch offered to help provided it could dock with the migrants at an Italian port, which the Italian authorities refused.
Italy's hardline interior minister Matteo Salvini has warned that NGO migrant rescue ships would not be allowed to unload their ""human cargo"" in Italian ports. The new anti-immigration government last week banned the French NGO-operated vessel Aquarius, with more than 600 migrants on board, from docking in Italy, causing uproar and a sharp spat with France.
Salvini, who took office on June 1st, accuses the charities of being complicit with human smugglers operating in Libya. ""These people should know that Italy no longer wants to be any part of this business of clandestine immigration and they will have to look for other ports to go to,"" he said at the weekend.
An Italian court, however, on Tuesday dropped due to lack of evidence a case in which two NGOs, including Sea Watch, had been accused of having links with human smugglers and facilitating illegal immigration to Italy.
Salvini said on Tuesday that Italy would submit a proposal on migration policy to its European partners in ""two or three days"".

					11:08 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy shutters tiny town's landmark migrant model,"Italy's interior ministry ordered Saturday that all migrants be transferred out of a tiny southern town that had welcomed them but which triggered a national debate on integration after its mayor was
arrested.
Domenico Lucano, the left-leaning mayor of Riace, made headlines around the world for welcoming migrants to the sparsely-populated town in Calabria in a bid to boost jobs and development.
But earlier this month, he was placed under house arrest on charges of involvement in organising ""marriages of convenience"" for asylum purposes.
Known as Mimmo, the mayor has also been accused of skipping a tender process to award a rubbish management contract to co-operatives with ties to migrants.
His arrest was hailed by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini and his far-right League party as proof that the ""government of change has declared war on the immigration business"".
But it sparked an outcry from supporters who say the ""Riace model"" - funded since the 2000s with Italian and European funds - is a simple but effective way to both revive depopulated villages and house hundreds of asylum seekers.
The transferral of the migrants to other centres will begin next week, according to the ministry, which has been investigating ""clear irregularities"" in the town's reception system since 2016.
The state gives small centres 35 euros a day for each resident with the bulk of the money spent on providing accommodation, food and language lessons.
A small amount of pocket money is also given to the migrants.
Model for integration
Lucano said his lawyers were preparing an appeal against the ministry, which has demanded a breakdown of all expenses.
""How is it possible to think of destroying the 'Riace model', which has been described by innumerable people, politicians, intellectuals and artists, as an extraordinary experience?"" he asked.
""They want to destroy us,"" he added. ""I am immensely bitter.""
His migrant programme has seen abandoned houses restored and craft workshops reopened in Riace, attracting tourists, and has been lauded by many as a model of integration.
Lucano was even named one of the 100 most influential personalities by Fortune magazine in 2016 and inspired a docu-fiction by Wim Wenders.
Salvini, who wants to reduce projects inspired by Riace and group asylum seekers in large centres, has seen his popularity increase since the coalition government came to power in June.

""I still remember what happened during the New Year's Eve celebrations in Cologne in 2015, and also elsewhere,"" he added.
Hundreds of women suffered sexual assaults by groups of mainly north African men that night in scenes that shocked Germany and inflamed debate about Merkel's decision that year to allow in a large number of asylum seekers at the height of Europe's migrant crisis.

Several high-profile crimes committed by migrants since then have further hardened the public mood, fuelling the rise of the far-right, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Most recently, far-right extremists have rallied in the eastern city of Chemnitz after a German man was stabbed to death on August 26th, with an Iraqi asylum seeker the prime suspect. Images of far-right protesters chasing down foreign-looking people in violent demonstrations and of neo-Nazis giving the Hitler salute in front of lines of police officers have stunned the nation.
""Violence is never a solution,"" Salvini told Deutsche Welle. ""Violence calls for violence, but the German government has been underestimating the problem for years, and the rise of the AfD is clearly a reaction.""
Salvini has taken a tough anti-immigration stance since his hard-right League party formed a government with the populist Five Star Movement last June.
He has refused NGO migrant rescue ships access to Italian ports, and accuses Brussels of having abandoned Italy as it struggles to deal with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants since 2013.

					08:32 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Italy's Salvini in Libya as migrants disembark Danish cargo ship,"Italy's new government took its fight to block migrants to Libya on Monday as a new boat with hundreds on board remained stranded at sea, deepening a crisis shaking Europe.
With European leaders at each other's throats over the large number of migrants arriving from North Africa, Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini paid a surprise visit to Tripoli.
There, he called for the establishment of processing centres in various unnamed African countries to deal with potential migrants in a move ""to help Libya as well as Italy block migration"".
Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.
Salvini's unexpected trip came a day after emergency talks between 16 European Union leaders in a bid to break a longstanding deadlock over who should take in the migrants, the bulk of whom have been landing in Italy and Greece.
The crisis came to a head earlier this month when Italy's new populist government turned away a rescue boat carrying 630 people, which was also rejected by Malta, forcing the vessel to remain at sea until Spain offered them safe haven.
But the relief was short-lived, with Italy and Malta refusing a second vessel carrying 234 migrants who were rescued on Thursday.
The move left Germany-operated rescue boat Lifeline stranded in international waters near Malta.
""Let's see if Europe remembers that it actually exists because there is still a boat loaded with migrants in Maltese waters waiting for a port to welcome it and we can tell you again, it won't be in an Italian port,"" Salvini said.
However a Danish cargo ship owned by Maersk, the world's leading container shipping company, with 108 migrants on board was allowed to dock at the southern Sicilian port of Pozzalo after waiting offshore for three days for instructions from the Italian authorities.
A tugboat pulled the ship into the harbour at around 11pm, an AFP reporter said.
It had changed course early Friday to help 113 people off of Libya, of whom five including four children and a pregnant woman disembarked in Sicily.
Danish Immigration Minister Inger Støjberg, herself a hardliner on immigration, said earlier she would send a letter to Salvini to ask him to act on their situation.

Ramping up the rhetoric, Salvini earlier warned foreign charities to stop rescuing migrants off Libya, accusing them of ""causing trouble"" and saying Italian ports ""are and will be closed to those who aid human traffickers.""
His remarks came as Libya's coastguard said it had rescued nearly a 1,000 people on Sunday, and Spanish authorities said they had picked up more than 600 others off their coast on Monday.
Salvini has insisted Italy will not take in ""one more"" refugee, vowing to close its ports to all foreign-flagged rescue ships and demanding that Europe shoulder the burden, warning the migration crisis could threaten the bloc's future.
""We will jointly support, with Libyan authorities, the setting up of reception and identification centres south of Libya, on the external border of Libya, to help Libya as well as Italy block migration,"" Salvini told a news conference in Tripoli.
Ahmed Maiteeq, deputy head of the Government of National Accord (GNA), said Libya would host a migration summit in September.
Earlier, he told Italy's La Repubblica daily that Europe ""must think of structural measures to take in African countries to stop migrants.""
On his return to Rome, Salvini said a technical team would be set up this week with representatives from Italy, Niger, Chad and Mali.
He dismissed calls by France and Spain for asylum-seekers to be kept in closed centres until their claims are processed -- a proposal Rome fears would turn Italy into ""a refugee camp for all of Europe"".
""Welcome hotspots in Italy? It would be a problem for us and for Libya itself because it would not stop these deadly waves (of migration). We have proposed reception centres south of Libya to avoid Tripoli becoming a funnel, like Italy,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""The only way to really counteract the traffickers' criminal interests and avoid these voyages of death is to stop these boats putting out to sea,"" he added in a separate statement.
The crisis has seen France's Emmanuel Macron accusing Rome of ""irresponsibility"" for turning away the boats, and Italy denouncing Paris for its hypocrisy in pushing migrants back across their shared border.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing an ultimatum from her hardline interior minister who has given her until the end of June to find a European deal to curb new arrivals.
Sunday's emergency EU leaders meeting had aimed to clear the air between member states ahead of a scheduled full summit on Thursday and Friday.
Both Macron and Merkel have vowed to forge ahead with like-minded leaders on ways to reduce migrant flows, but the EU's top migration official warned that Europe would solve the crisis only by working together.
""We must find a way to adopt a shared policy and a shared strategy to face this situation, otherwise the European project is in danger,"" Dimitris Avramopoulos told AFP on a visit to Tehran.

Police and coastguards escorted some of the migrants off the ""Diciotti"", according to an AFP reporter at the scene, while Italian media showed them boarding black buses waiting for them on the quay.
The 67 migrants -- including three women and six children -- were earlier held at the port in Trapani as a row brewed over reports that a handful of the group revolted after they were rescued, amid fears that they would be returned to Libya.
Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said earlier on Thursday night that they would be allowed off the boat once identification procedures had been achieved ""in particular for those who may have committed a crime"".
Initially picked up by a supply vessel the ""Vos Thalassa"" over the weekend, the migrants were subsequently transferred to a coast guard ship after staff made emergency calls to authorities in Rome.
According to Italian media, sailors aboard the Vos Thalassa locked themselves in the control room and called for help after two migrants with mobile phones and GPS realized that the boat was heading south back towards Libya, sparking a furious reaction from some on board.

Migrants trying to reach Europe are desperate not to be returned to Libya where they face abuse and rape in detention centres.
The incident comes as tensions over migration rise in Europe, with 28 EU interior ministers meeting Thursday in the Austrian city of Innsbruck for a summit focused on finding a common migration plan. Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini -- who has authority over the country's ports -- initially refused to allow the Diciotti to dock, despite previously saying ports would remain open for Italian naval and coast guard ships carrying migrants.
""If there was violence (on board the Vos Thalassa), the perpetrators will go to prison and if there was no violence, because someone lied, then they (those who supposedly lied) will suffer the consequences,"" Salvini -- who is also the leader of the far-right League party -- said on the sidelines of the Austria summit.
According to Italian media the standoff was resolved after a call in the afternoon from President Sergio Mattarella to Conte.
A group of charities, including Unicef and Save the Children, earlier issued a joint statement calling for the disembarkation of ""refugees and migrants, including women and children, who have been at sea for four days"". Although the number of migrants fleeing war and poverty has fallen sharply since a 2015 peak, the issue remains deeply contentious in Europe, with the summit in Austria discussing tough new proposals but failing to reach a firm agreement.
Salvini, who wants to stop migrants arriving at Italian coasts, has banned charity rescue boats operating in the Mediterranean from docking in Italy, accusing them of aiding human traffickers to bring migrants to Europe.
The case of the Diciotti has also highlighted a split within Italy's coalition government, which includes the League and Luigi Di Maio's Five Star Movement whose left fringe is opposed to the closing of Italian ports."
