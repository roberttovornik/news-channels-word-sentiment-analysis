					16:46 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Swiss teachers expect too little of migrant children: study,"A new study shows that teachers are failing school students with a migrant background by expecting too little of them.
“Those who demand too little of children, demand less and less of them,” said Markus Neuenschwander, author of the SCALA study, which was carried out by University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern's (FHNW).
One of the most surprising findings of the study was that teachers had lower expectations of students with a migrant background even when it came to mathematics, where there is no real different in terms of results achieved compared to students without that background.

In German classes, where a difference in results could be expected, teachers' expectations of migrant children were even lower.
Neuenschwander said the survey-based results meant a vicious circle: teachers' prejudices were confirmed.
“The difference in performance between migrants and non-migrants gets larger during their school career,” he told Swiss weekly NZZ am Sonntag.
The study's also results confirm the findings of research carried out overseas.
“Lower expectations lead to lower performance,” said University of Zurich education researcher Katharina Maag.
For Neuenschwander, the results of the study are clear: teachers need further education designed to question their preconceptions of migrant children.
“Most of them are not aware that they have prejudices,” he said.
A study of 15,000 students published late last year showed children of immigrants in Switzerland are more likely to fail when they start senior high school or vocational training because their parents don't know the Swiss system very well.
According to the study undertaken by the universities of Zurich and Bern, a huge 46 percent of teens born to immigrant parents fall behind after age 15. Either they drop out of continuing education, are forced to retake a year or take a gap year. That compares with just 31 percent of children born to Swiss parents.

					10:23 CET+01:00				", The Local,Switzerland’s tough stance on migrants criticized by Amnesty International,"Switzerland has been taken to task by the human rights group Amnesty International for its tough treatment of asylum seekers and migrants.
The country was violating international legal principles by returning migrants and asylum seekers with rejected asylum claims to countries where they are in danger of persecution, Amnesty said in its annual report published on Thursday.
The human rights group cited the examples ""of people with failed asylum claims or undocumented migrants"" being sent back to countries including Sri Lanka, Turkey and Sudan where they were at risk of ""serious human rights"" violations.
In its report into the state of human rights in 159 countries around the world, Amnesty also said concerns remained “regarding the use of disproportionate force during the deportation of migrants” while several asylum seekers had been returned to other Schengen countries under the Dublin regulation ""without duly taking into account their family ties in Switzerland"".
According to EU rules enshrined in the Dublin Convention, their applications for asylum should therefore be processed in the first EU country in which they arrive.
Amnesty International also expressed concerns over a highly-controversial initiative put forward for referendum by the right-wing Swiss People’s Party which calls for Swiss law to be given primacy over international law and would see Switzerland renegotiating or even renouncing international treaties, including those on human rights, if necessary.
The ‘Swiss law instead of foreign judges (initiative for self-determination)' has been heavily criticised by the Swiss government who say it would seriously threaten the country’s stability.
No date has been set for the vote.
Geneva Papyrus project
In related news, the first round of results of a pilot project being run in Geneva with the aim of ""regularizing"" the position of the city’s many undocumented workers has been cautiously welcomed by the State Secretary for Migration Mario Gattiker.
The so-called ‘Papyrus’ project – developed in secret in agreement with federal Swiss authorities in what Geneva's economy minister Pierre Maudet described as a bid to “lift institutional hypocrisy and put an end to the exploitation of people without papers” – has seen 1,093 obtain legal paperwork, Geneva daily the Tribune de Genève reported on Tuesday.
A total of 81 percent of those people are from Latin America with many working as nannies or cleaners.
""I agree that a solution needs to found for these people. The Geneva experience is interesting but I am waiting on the final evaluation,"" state migration secretary Gattiker said after the preliminary figures were released.
The Papyrus project is to run until the end of 2018 with some 2,200 to 2,500 people expected to benefit from the scheme. Conditions are strict. Applicants must be financially independent and have no criminal record. In addition, applicants with families must have lived in the canton of Geneva for five years, while that figure is 10 years for singles. A good level of French is also a condition.
Recent figures from the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) suggest there are 13,000 undocumented workers in Geneva and 73,000 in Switzerland."

Swiss federal authorities said they have drawn up three separate scenarios ranging from 10,000 arrivals inside a month to a worst case of 30,000 inside a few days.
The latter ""would necessitate army intervention,"" the government said.
In a statement on Wednesday the government said it had tasked the defence ministry with putting 2,000 troops on standby for such an eventuality.
The plans, agreed last Thursday, aim to coordinate state, cantonal and communal response in the event of a large influx of people.
While the government noted that for the moment no such military intervention is necessary, it said it wanted to be able to react quickly.
Given the current shifting state of migratory routes ""Switzerland could be faced in the coming weeks or months by an influx of people seeking protection,"" it told AFP.
During the Kosovo crisis in 1999 Switzerland received 9,600 asylum applications in a single month, it said.
The number of people requesting asylum in Switzerland has dropped in recent months, according to latest figures, however the Swiss federal migration office (SEM) said the situation in Europe was still ""volatile"" and it could envisage the number of asylum seekers to Switzerland rising again during the course of the year.
Under the emergency plans up to 9,000 beds would be made available for migrants under scenario three.
The SEM has already increased the number of places available from 2,200 to 4,600 over the past year, it said."

The 21-year-old migrant lacked the correct papers to leave Italy and had been smuggled onto a Switzerland-bound train at Milan's Central station by a friend who was travelling legally.
Once the train reached Chiasso, a town just over the Swiss-Italian border in the southern canton of Ticino, guards boarded the train to carry out checks.
But their suspicion was quickly aroused by the strange shape and extreme weight of the suitcase, which was removed from the train.
Guards placed the luggage on the platform, at which point the young migrant-contortionist calmly emerged. A video below, uploaded to YouTube on Monday, shows the feat.
The trick did little to impress border guards however, and the migrant and his friend were immediately sent back to Italy.

The incident came after far-right activists from the pan-European movement Generation Identity blocked the nearby Echelle pass in protest at the rise in migrant crossings of the Alps, as other routes around Europe have been shut down.

Both Switzerland and Austria insisted the influx of migrants should not be borne alone by the countries where they first arrive — Italy, Malta, Cyprus and Greece.
Sommaruga said Switzerland had already decided to take in another 3,000 Syrian refugees in addition to the 10,000 already in the country.

The figure from 2015 already dwarfs that of 2014, when 219,000 made the crossing throughout the entire year.
The majority of arrivals in Greece were Syrians fleeing the country's protracted civil war, while Eritreans topped the list of migrants who have landed in Italy.

""Unfortunately, we have now reached a milestone whereby over 2,000 migrants and refugees have died as of this past weekend,"" International Organization for Migration spokesman Itayi Virri told reporters in the Swiss city.
The organization said around 188,000 people had been rescued so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean, and warned the 200,000-mark could be crossed by the end of the week.
IOM said the latest toll confirms ""this route as the deadliest for migrants in search of a better life,"" and warned the situation was worsening.
Up until the end of July last year, more than 1,600 migrants perished trying to make the journey, with 3,279 dying throughout the whole of 2014.
Nearly all of the people crossing the Mediterranean so far this year, often in rickety boats and at the mercy of human traffickers, have landed either in Italy (97,000) or Greece (90,500), the IOM said.
Virri said the so-called central Mediterranean route had proved by far the deadliest, with just over 1,930 people dying trying to cross from Libya to Italy so far this year, while only about 60 had died trying to reach Greece.
The eastern route is shorter and IOM said that traffickers taking people to Italy tended to use more unseaworthy vessels, leading to the higher death toll.
Nineteen people lost their lives in the Channel of Sicily last week alone, with the bodies of 14 migrants brought to the Sicilian port of Messina on July 29th.
They had been travelling with 456 others who were rescued.
And on Monday, 550 migrants rescued in the Mediterranean over the weekend arrived in Sicily aboard a ship operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which also carried the bodies of five people who died at sea.
The victims, four women and one man, were found dead on a boat that was rescued on Saturday with 112 people on board, and appeared to have died of dehydration.
Tragic milestone
While lamenting the tragic milestone of more than 2,000 deaths, Virri pointed out that increased European Union efforts since April to rescue migrants at sea meant ""a lot of people have been saved who otherwise would have lost their lives.""
Many of those risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean travel on to other European countries, with a number of them setting their sights on Britain, which along with France is grappling with a migrant crisis of its own.
The migrant crisis in the northern French port of Calais has hit the headlines in the past week, with hundreds of people desperate to reach Britain making attempt after attempt to breach Eurotunnel defences, some paying for it with their lives.
Last week, a Sudanese man in his 30s died, apparently crushed to death by a lorry, and at least 10 people have been killed since June trying to get through the Channel Tunnel to Britain where many already have family and work is perceived as easier to find.
Police said some 600 attempts were made to get into the tunnel from the Calais side overnight to Tuesday, and around 1,700 attempts were made the night before.
Between 3,000 and 5,000 migrants are meanwhile reported to be camped out in Calais waiting for a chance to cross to Britain, and IOM on Tuesday urged Europe to seek broader, long-term measures to address the wider migrant crisis affecting the continent.
It cautioned that ""stop-gap measures such as fences and barriers being planned or erected in the EU"", including at Calais, would not stop irregular migration but would put vulnerable migrants more at risk of falling prey to smugglers.
""Europe has a moral and a historic responsibility to respond in a humanitarian way,"" IOM regional director for the EU Eugenio Ambrosi said in a statement."

""The number of people displaced by war and conflict is the highest seen in Western and Central Europe since the 1990s,"" the UNHCR said, referring to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia that decade.
Half of those who made it to Europe this year were Syrians fleeing their country's brutal civil war, the UNHCR said, underscoring the conflict's dominant role in fuelling Europe's migrant crisis.
Afghans made up 20 percent of the group, while seven percent of arrivals were Iraqis.
After Greece, Italy received the second highest number of migrants, with 150,317 people reaching its territory this year, all by sea.
This marked a slight declined from 2014, when 170,000 people landed in Italy after crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa.
Rounding out the group of European countries that saw migrant arrivals in 2015 was Bulgaria (29,959), Spain (3,845), Cyprus (269) and Malta (106).

In total, around 5,000 unaccompanied migrants aged under 18 at the time of arrival currently live in Switzerland, said the broadcaster, quoting the Swiss migration office (SEM).
However after saying they want to claim asylum, many then flee the official reception centres and disappear from the authorities' radar.
In total 539 young migrants went missing in 2016 – a figure that includes 81 who were aged over 18 but who are counted as minors because they claimed asylum when they were under 18.
The vast majority – 324 – were aged 16-17, while 134 were in the age bracket 6-15.
So far this year 310 minors have dropped off the SEM's radar.
Speaking to the broadcaster, Valentina Darbellay of Swiss child aid agency Terre des hommes said many of these young people risked ending up victims of trafficking or as delinquents.
Reporting practices vary from canton to canton, meaning young migrants are not always reported missing as non-migrant children would be, she said, adding that this discrimination was “shocking”.
Lukas Rieder, a spokesman for the SEM, recognized that young migrants going missing was a problem, but said the elevated numbers last year were proportional to the number of young asylum seekers now living in Switzerland.
The SEM intends to work with the canton of “harmonize” practices across the country, he told RTS.
The issue does not only concern the underage.
Last September the SEM confirmed that in the previous three months between 20 and 40 percent of asylum seekers had fled reception centres after claiming asylum.
A report in the media suggested that in some areas of the country up to 90 percent of asylum seekers flee while awaiting the outcome of their application.
The SEM said at the time that most of those who disappear from Swiss reception centres are thought to be heading for Germany.
As a result, there's nothing to suggest that there are more illegals living in Switzerland.
Under the rules of the Dublin agreement, refugees are only allowed to enter Switzerland if they say they want to claim asylum here.
Anyone who does not state their intention to claim asylum in Switzerland is refused entry and must return to the first European country they entered."

""Norway should also have a referendum on immigration,"" Keshvari said. ""I am quite sure that there is majority support for tightening immigration across Norway's political parties,"" he said. ""The polls show that."" On Sunday, the Swiss voted with a razor-thin 50.3 percent majority to limit immigration by drawing up immigration quotas, surprising the country's establishment. The decision has provoked calls for similar quotas from far-right parties elsewhere in Europe, with Germany's anti-EU party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), and France's National Front both calling for new Swiss-inspired immigration laws. Norway is the first country where a government party has backed the Swiss decision, however. Progress's position clashed with that of Norway's Conservative Party, which leads the ruling two-party coalition. Europe Minister Vidar Helgesen said her party supported open labour markets. ""We in Norway want to emphasize that the principle of free movement of people is essential for growth and prosperity in an open economy,"" she said after the Swiss result. Switzerland and Norway are both members of the European Economic Area (EEA), rather than the European Union, so any new immigration law Switzerland successfully negotiates within the EEA treaty could in theory be adopted by Norway. ""Progress has said many times that Norway should study the EEA agreement and use whatever room for manoeuver there is to limit immigration,"" Keshvari said. He accused Lithuanians and Poles of being drawn to Norway by the country's free health care and generous social security benefits. Keshvari said the party had yet to decide on what kinds of limits to immigration it wants to impose. ""We have not taken a position on quotas, either in the Progress program or in government policy,"" he said.

Among the modifications to be debated next month in parliament is a requirement that only holders of C residency permits would be eligible to seek citizenship. Holders of such permits are foreigners from the European Union or European Free Trade Agreement countries who have been granted a “settlement permit” after living in Switzerland for five or ten years. C permits are also available to foreigners from other countries who have been granted settlement permits after ten years of uninterrupted residence in Switzerland. The proposed revision will allow for eligible foreign residents to apply for citizenship after living eight years in the country, reduced from the current 12 years. But this will be more than offset by the C permit requirement, according to a study from the University of Geneva. The study was presented in Bern this week by the federal commission for migration issues (FCM). It concluded that the number of new naturalized citizens would drop by 3,500 a year if the new proposals are accepted. Switzerland’s citizenship requirements are among the toughest in the world. Almost a quarter of the country’s residents are foreigners. But even for children of these foreigners who are Swiss-born, citizenship is far from automatic, requiring approval at federal, cantonal and municipal levels. The FCM recommends that citizenship be handled by a single body and that children born in the country should be automatically eligible to carry a Swiss passport. “Obtaining (Swiss) citizenship allowed me to integrate in the country,” Fiametta Jahreiss, vice-chairwoman of the federal commission, told a press conference, according to the ATS news agency. This is the opposite of the idea that it is necessary to become integrated in the country before earning citizenship, said Jahreiss, who became a citizen through marriage. The University of Geneva study showed that most cases of naturalized citizenship were granted in urban areas. Between 2005 and 2010, the Zurich region recorded 61,852 “naturalizations”, the most in the country. A total of 62,077 foreigners became Swiss citizens over the same period in the Lake Geneva region, including the cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais.

Under Switzerland's direct democracy rules, any individual can push for a referendum on condition that he or she collects more than 100,000 from eligible voters to support the cause within 18 months.
The SVP said it would now begin the process of verifying the collected signatures with the aim of filing its initiative at the beginning of next year.
According to the initiative's draft text, the party wants Switzerland to ""manage the immigration of foreigners in an autonomous manner"".
In addition, it requires the country to impose a quota on the annual numbers of migrants admitted.
Any international treaties contravening these requirements ""should be renegotiated and adapted within a deadline of three years"".
Switzerland used to accept only a specific number of migrants annually. But after signing a deal with the European Union, citizens from the bloc are now free to reside in the country, provided that they are financially self-sufficient.
If accepted by the population, the SVP's initiative would therefore have an impact on the free movement of people treaty with the EU.

On Wednesday the lower house of parliament decided that Switzerland should not put the brakes on EU immigration by imposing strict quotas unilaterally, reported Swiss media.
The majority of MPs reached such a conclusion after five hours of fierce debate over how Switzerland should implement the 2014 initiative, which saw the public approve the principle of limiting immigration.
Instead of fixed quotas, the lower house favours a ‘light' solution which would mean prioritizing Swiss nationals for jobs and only taking more drastic measures if Brussels agrees.
Since the controversial but legally binding referendum more than two years ago, the government has been grappling to find a way to limit immigration while preserving its bilateral agreements with the bloc, which are dependent on maintaining the free movement of people.
It has until February 2017 to find a solution that the EU considers acceptable, but as yet negotiations with Brussels have not borne fruit.
After Wednesday's heated debate on the subject – broadcast live on Swiss television – the majority of MPs voted to back a 'light' solution proposed by a parliamentary commission, said news agencies.
Only the SVP dissented. The hardline party, which supported the 2014 popular initiative, claimed such a solution waters down its original intentions since it does not allow for fixed quotas or give Switzerland autonomy over immigration.
With tensions running high, the SVP's Adrian Amstutz said the proposal was a “violation of the constitution in all its splendour” and the “death of direct democracy”.
Others accused the commission of abusing its function in suggesting such a solution.
But the majority of MPs felt it was more important to maintain the country's relationship with the EU than apply the 2014 initiative to the letter.
Speaking on behalf of the parliamentary commission, Socialist Cesla Amarelle said it was essential to preserve Switzerland's bilateral agreements with the EU and a ‘light' solution would unblock the impasse with the bloc.
Dismissing the SVP's complaints, she said their own proposals were “mediocre” and that the constitution allowed MPs some room to manoeuvre, reported Le Tribune de Genève.
Matthias Jauslin of the Liberal-Radicals said his party did not want to jeopardize Switzerland's bilateral agreements with the EU and therefore the 2014 initiative could not be applied to the letter.
To do so would be fatal for the economy, added another MP.
Despite Wednesday's vote, the debate is far from over. Parliament will now consider the detail of the commission's proposal, with many other suggestions still on the table.
The senate must also consider the proposal, scheduled for December."

					16:03 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Mediterranean migrant death toll hits new high,"More than 3,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, more than double the previous peak in 2011, the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said on Monday.
Europe is by far the most dangerous destination for ""irregular"" migrants, the organization found in a report, with 3,072, or 75 percent, of the 4,077 registered migrant deaths worldwide since January happening in the Mediterranean. In the 216-page report titled ""Fatal Journeys: migrant fatalities across land and sea"", IOM said more than 40,000 people had perished since 2000 while migrating — 22,000 of them while trying to reach Europe. ""It's time to do more than count the number of victims,"" IOM chief William Lacy Swing said in a statement. ""It's time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants,"" added Swing, whose agency is not part of the United Nations but works closely with the world body. The IOM report comes just weeks after one of the deadliest wrecks on record, when a ship carrying some 500 migrants, including Syrians, Palestinians and Egyptians and an estimated 100 children, sank. The 11 known survivors have said the traffickers organizing their dangerous crossing from North Africa deliberately sank the vessel off Malta. That catastrophe came less than a year after two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa left more than 400 migrants dead, catapulting the issue into international headlines. The grim tally of Mediterranean deaths during the first nine months of 2014 is already more than double the previous peak of 1,500 during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and nearly five times the prior peak of 630 in 2007, the organization said. The soaring number of deaths ""likely reflects a dramatic increase in the number of migrants trying to reach Europe,"" the report said. More than 112,000 ""irregular migrants"" were detected by Italian authorities during the first eight months of this year — nearly three times as many as in all of 2013, it said. ""Many are fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty,"" the report said, with people trying to escape Syria's bloody civil war and Eritreans fleeing their repressive regime and forced, decades-long conscription accounting for the largest groups arriving in Italy this year. The deteriorating security situation in Libya, a transit country for many migrants, is also pushing up the numbers of people trying to make it to Europe by any means possible, it said. Elsewhere in the world, more than 6,000 migrants perished along the US-Mexican border between 1998 and 2013, meaning nearly 400 people died there annually over the 16-year-period. Around 100 people have also died on average each year since 2000 in the seas bordering Australia, while thousands of others have succumbed in Africa's Sahara Desert and in the Indian Ocean."

					21:08 CET+01:00				",Malcolm Curtis,Moody's: Swiss migrant vote ‘credit negative',"Curbs on immigration from the European Union will hurt Switzerland's economy and its banking sector, ratings agency Moody's said in a statement issued on Tuesday.
Swiss voters on February 9th supported an initiative to reintroduce quotas on immigrants from the EU in a move that has already led to retaliation from the 28-country bloc. “Limiting immigration is likely to affect the country's growth potential, wealth and overall economic strength,” Moody’s said, noting that the effect of the vote was “credit negative”. The agency noted that Switzerland has benefited over the past decade from the “strong inflow of highly qualified workers”. Moody's said it believes that this has “helped mitigate the adverse effects of population ageing and skilled labour shortages, thereby positively contributing to employment and economic growth.” It said that immigration curbs would also have an adverse impact on the “asset quality” of Swiss banks and potentially on their capitalization. The quotas “could reduce housing demand, thereby exerting pressure on residential house prices, and potentially leading to a faster-than-anticipated slowdown in residential housing markets,” Moody’s global credit research department said. “In addition, negative repercussions on Swiss-EU trade may put pressure on export-oriented businesses, thereby leading to weaker corporate asset quality.” Moody’s added that the degree of impact of the immigration initiative would depend on how it is implemented over the next three years. The actual level of quotas was not determined in the initiative and it will be up to the government to establish this. So far the reaction of investors to the immigration vote has been muted. The Swiss franc has actually strengthened against the euro (trading at 0.81837 cents late Tuesday) since the referendum results were announced and UBS is predicting strong economic growth for the country of 2.1 percent for this year. Switzerland’s key SMI stock index, meanwhile, has risen since the vote. The federal government has emphasized that the freedom of movement agreement with the EU remains in effect until a new system is put in place. But the EU has responded by freezing research grants to Swiss universities and funding for the Erasmus student exchange program. It has also suspended talks on electricity exports. Moody’s warned that “if there are strictly binding limitations on (Swiss) immigration that dismiss existing bilateral agreements, current trade facilitations between Switzerland and the EU could be partially withdrawn"". ."

IOM's announcement came just a month after the 100,000-mark was passed, and the United Nations warned the surge in arrivals was creating humanitarian crises that required a ""collective and far-reaching"" European response.
Nearly all of the people who have crossed the Mediterranean so far this year have landed in Italy, which has counted around 75,000 arrivals, and Greece, which has seen the numbers explode.
So far this year, more than 77,000 people have landed on Greek shores, compared to only 34,442 for all of 2014, according to the UN refugee agency, which on Friday warned the country was facing a ""growing humanitarian crisis"".
""On average, 1,000 arrive every day on the Greek islands,"" UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told reporters in Geneva, adding that most of them were fleeing from war-ravaged Syria.
""The numbers of people arriving are now so high that despite all efforts, the authorities and local communities can no longer cope,"" he warned, insisting ""urgent response from Europe is needed before the situation deteriorates further.""
""Greece urgently needs help and we expect Europe to step forward,"" he said.
EU leaders agreed last month to redistribute 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum-seekers already in Europe to help take the load off countries like Greece and Italy, but on a voluntary basis after many member states objected strongly to proposed mandatory quotas.
The crisis is being felt further afield as well.
Nearly all of the migrants and refugees who arrive in Greece, where the reception capacity is ""completely overwhelmed"", move on, trying to reach western and northern Europe by passing through the western Balkans region.
Spindler said that in June, the number of people crossing from Greece into Macedonia and Serbia had soared to an average of 1,000 per day.
""The capacity of these countries to effectively respond to the emergency situation is severely overstretched,"" he said, insisting though that ""the tightening of borders and building of walls (as Hungary is planning to do) are not the solution.""
""We would expect the European Union to activate its emergency response, because Greece is part of the European Union, and this is happening in Europe.
""It is happening on the doorstep of Europe,"" Spindler said, also demanding more assistance to countries in the ""immediate EU neighbourhood"" like Macedonia and Serbia.
As Europe grapples with how to handle the massive numbers who make it to its shores, IOM pointed out that 1,914 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year — more than twice as high as at the same point in 2014."

Thousands of workers cross the border daily from Germany, France and Italy to work in Switzerland — a practice Sunday’s vote could imperil. Jean-François Besson, the secretary general of ""Groupement Transfrontalier Europeen"", which represents tens of thousands of French nationals working Switzerland, told The Local on Monday that the vote was a ""rejection"" of French workers and it will inevitably spark concern and uncertainty. “Of course we are worried. It’s not good news. Firstly psychologically it sends a negative message to foreigners in Switzerland. It says ‘the people of Switzerland have voted against you’. It’s a rejection of foreigners,"" Besson said. “Secondly they are anxious about their economic situation. Although there are no immediate consequences, the French people who work in Switzerland will be worried about their future status. They will now enter a period of insecurity. Find out how the French are reacting on The Local France. People living in the border areas of Italy were also looking for reassurance from Switzerland on Monday. Italy’s economic woes have made Switzerland’s Italian-speaking canton of Ticino an increasingly popular destination for workers and business owners from northern Italy in recent years: “There has been a strong increase in the number of daily commuters, and seasonal workers, from Italy in Ticino,” Ferruccio Pastore, director of the International and European Forum for Migration Research in Turin told The Local. “And many Italian companies have moved across the border, bringing their own workers with them.” The irony is that “many Italians have voted against Italians”, Pastore added, pointing out that Ticino was one of the areas most strongly in favour of restrictions. Find out more about the Italian reaction on The Local Italy. In Germany, one of the biggest sources of foreign workers in Switzerland, the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper said the referendum showed the Swiss weren’t afraid of cheap labour - but the more expensive kind: “The Swiss are not angry about 'social tourists' but more about the influx of highly qualified, skilled workers that causes rents to rise, and the cheap labourers who give Swiss minimum-wage workers a tougher time finding jobs.” Germans who cross the border could find themselves seeing the experience through the eyes of Bulgarians and Romanians entering EU countries, it concluded.
Find out what the Germans think on The Local Germany. The referendum will not take effect immediately — the Swiss government has three years to incorporate it into law. Copycat laws? The result also brought calls for copycat laws from Eurosceptics in Germany and France. Germany's anti-EU party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) Monday picked up the baton and called for a similar law in Germany. ""Independent of the content of the Swiss referendum, we should also create an immigration law in Germany which is based on the qualifications and integration abilities of the immigrants, and effectively prevents immigration into our social support systems,"" Bernd Lucke, AfD spokesman said on Monday. In Italy, Roberto Santalucia, mayor of border town Bellano, said he feared the spread of restrictions. He said the vote will “reinforce right-wing policies” and is only intended to “exclude others”, something that could have a worrying impact on the rest of Europe. French political analyst Jean-Yves Camus from IRIS (Institute of International Relations and Strategies) told The Local on Monday that France’s National Front will use the Swiss referendum to its own advantage as it campaigns for the upcoming local elections. “The National Front will try to show French voters that there is already one country where people voted against Europe and against immigration,"" Camus said. ""They will argue that if the Swiss people who are well educated and in a financially strong position can vote against Europe and immigration then so can you’”.

According to a statement by Bern police, the family was due to be deported from Switzerland under the Dublin rules, which state that a person must claim asylum in the first EU country they enter, a policy to which Switzerland adheres.

Friday's protest comes after Bern announced in April it planned to review the status of 3,200 of the 9,400 Eritreans granted temporary residence in Switzerland.
That decision came after the Federal Administrative Court ruled in August last year that it was reasonable to return Eritrean citizens who had already previously performed military service to the African country as they were unlikely either to be required to re-join the military or to face other punishment.

Swiss authorities stressed in April that all people affected by the new rule changes would have the right to a judicial hearing and that cases would be dealt with on an individual basis.
But on Friday, protesters carried banners with messages such as “Eritrea is one huge prison”, “Stop negotiations with the dictator” and “We did not flee for fun”.
Annelies Djiellal-Müller, one of the organisers of Friday's protest, stressed that the act of returning to Eritrea was highly dangerous. She told Swiss daily Der Bund that all people who left the country did so illegally, risking being shot when they did so then facing a dangerous journey to Europe across the Sahara Desert.

When people did choose to return, the Eritrean embassy then demanded the names of family members and friends. Once back in Eritrea, returnees faced possible punishment for having left the country illegally.
“Would you take that risk for yourself and your loved ones?” Djiellal-Müller said.
Switzerland currently has no treaty with Eritrea regarding the return of migrants but State Secretary for Migration Mario Gattiker said in April that this did not mean such returns were not possible.
Switzerland only has a returns treaty with every second country, he said, and while Eritrea does not accept the forced return of migrants, voluntary returns were possible, he told Switzerland's Le Temps newspaper."

					08:22 CET+01:00				",AFP,Switzerland helps fund programme to identify migrants lost at sea,"An organization that helps relatives trace loved ones who have gone missing in conflicts and disasters is launching an ambitious project to identify the thousands of migrants lost while trying to reach Europe.
Thanks to a donation of $400,000 (340,000 euros) from Switzerland announced on Monday, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) will work over the next two years to set up a programme to locate and identify people who have died during perilous journeys across the Mediterranean.
In October the organization, which was born out of conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, completed its move to The Hague from Sarajevo, unveiling state-of-the-art laboratories which will help trace missing people through sophisticated new DNA tests, as the non-governmental body broadens its work around the world.
About 8,000 migrants are known to have died on Italian shores alone in the past decade, ICMP director Kathryne Bomberger said.
With the new Swiss funding, the ICMP will work with Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta ""to take stock of where they stand"" in efforts to trace the missing.
""The numbers are huge,"" she told AFP, adding that finding ""the survivors of those who are missing is going to be difficult ... it does take an international organization to connect the dots.""
The first phase of the programme will be to assess the situation -- such as finding out how many unidentified bodies have been found in those four countries and where the remains are held or have been buried -- and boost cooperation among all nations and agencies involved.
A second phase -- which would most likely begin after 2019 depending on whether the programme secures funding -- would allow the organisation to start the laborious work of taking DNA samples and trying to match them with relatives who have reported a missing family member.
The ICMP also hopes to help track down thousands of children believed to have been trafficked after being separated from their families en route.
There is no complete estimate of the missing, dead and trafficked and ""so far no one has really been found because the issue is falling between the cracks,"" Bomberger said.
Last month, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 3,033 refugees had died crossing the Mediterranean this year, a 40-percent drop from last year's record of 5,000 known or suspected drownings.
""Italy and most likely Greece now are confronted with an abnormal situation, which absolutely exceeds their capabilities,"" said Bomberger.
She hopes the ICMP can help ""alleviate the burden"" on national police and forensic authorities by taking over the DNA analyses."

""These are the circumstances that migrants are increasingly fleeing. The trauma they have suffered is appalling, (and) they deserve the international community's sympathy and compassion,"" he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council's main annual session in Geneva.
Instead, they were being met by ""a rising roar of xenophobia"", he said.
""To keep building higher walls against the flight of these desperate people is an act of cruelty and a delusion,"" he said.
His comments came against the backdrop of Europe's spiralling migrant
crisis, after more than one million people arrived on the continent last year, with the influx showing no sign of abating.
On Monday morning, Greek police said more than 7,000 people were massed at the border, in a buildup triggered by Austria and Balkan states capping the numbers of migrants entering their territory.
Zeid rejected such policies and the accompanying growing anti-immigrant and anti-minority rhetoric, warning that while this ""may offer instant political gratification in some quarters, (it results) in divisions that cut deep"".
""When leaders express, or ignite, waves of hate speech, as we have seen in recent months – hate speech against migrants, and specific ethnic and religious groups – they are setting off shockwaves whose impact will lead to violence,"" he said.
He warned against the ""distorted image of so-called invasion by people who are manifestly fleeing countries no longer safe for human life.""
""While I do not belittle the logistical difficulties (the arriving migrants) may create, they are a threat to no society,"" he insisted.
Zeid also cautioned against allowing the fear of terrorism to push countries to throw away the hard-won rights of their citizens.
""Crushing human freedoms will not protect us from terrorism,"" he said, pointing to the fear surrounding the brutal Islamic State (IS) jihadist group in particular.
""We must not throw our principles and our reason overboard because we are petrified by the grotesque abuses of a few thousand fanatics,"" he said.
Zeid said that while IS clearly ""is a powerful force for ill... Its behaviour and its mindset are so inhuman that it can only thrive in an atmosphere of deprivation and hate.""

					17:08 CEST+02:00				",Nina Larson/AFP,Swiss parliament tilts right over migration fears,"UPDATED: Initial Swiss election results and projections on Sunday showed the populist right significantly strengthening its already dominant position in parliament amid concerns over migration and asylum rules.
The first results ticking in from Switzerland's 26 cantons showed the country's largest party, the populist right-wing anti-immigration Swiss People's Party (SVP), making gains that were expected to tip the scale in
parliament towards a slight centre-right majority.
Observers had predicted that SVP would gain ground from the 26.6 percent of the vote they won in 2011, but initial regional results showed their support swelling more than expected and even possibly passing their all-time high in 2007 of 28.9 percent.
In all, 246 seats are up for grabs — 200 in the lower chamber and the remainder in the upper chamber.
The expected shift comes as surging numbers of migrants and refugees moving through Europe have heightened the focus on the issue in Switzerland, even though the wealthy Alpine nation is yet to be significantly affected by the crisis.
About a quarter of Switzerland's eight million inhabitants are foreign nationals, and immigration and asylum policies tend to figure among voters' top concerns.
'A lot at stake'
The latest survey from the gfs.bern polling institute showed that nearly 50 percent of voters considered migration the most important issue facing the country.
""I think there is a lot at stake, not only when it comes to the reception of refugees, but also the entire problem of the large numbers on the move,"" Colette Morel, a 69-year-old retired teacher, told AFP as she cast her ballot in the central canton of Fribourg.
SVP vice president and its most outspoken member, Christoph Blocher, insisted earlier this month that his party was the only one that could solve Switzerland's ""asylum problem"" and ""eliminate the chaos"".
Blocher, a multi-billionaire who served in the Swiss government from 2004-2007 before being pushed out over his confrontational style, saw his daughter Magdalena Martullo Blocher win a parliamentary seat Sunday in the eastern canton of Graubunden, the early results showed.
The SVP, which has previously sparked outcry with campaign posters such as one showing three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag, has in its national push this year been less provocative, resorting mainly to posters featuring pictures of candidates with the slogan ""Stay free"".
But some regional divisions of the party have gone much further, with the Vaud youth unit putting out a poster featuring a caricature of a jihadist, wearing an EU armband, preparing to decapitate a bound and gagged blonde woman wearing a Swiss flag tank top, flanked by the caption: ""Keep your head on your
shoulders"".
That poster also plays to the second top concern among the Swiss, according to the latest gfs.bern poll.
Nine percent of those questioned in the survey said they were most concerned about Switzerland's relationship with the European Union, which was badly hit by a narrow Swiss popular vote in February 2014, championed by the SVP, in favour of restricting immigration from the bloc.
The centre-right Liberals, in third place, were also seen gaining ground, according to the first results, helping move the pendulum in parliament towards the right.
The party, which largely sees eye-to-eye with SVP on economic and energy issues, takes a very different stance on a range of subjects, including on the question of immigration.
Magic formula
The Socialists, Switzerland's second largest party, were meanwhile seeing mixed results Sunday, snatching an extra seat in Zurich but losing one seat in Valais and another in Vaud, early results showed.
The Christian Democrats, the Greens and other smaller parties were seen taking a hit.
Power-sharing and consensus rule are the norm in Switzerland and elections rarely lead to major shifts in parliament or the makeup of the government, which does not directly reflect the power balance in the house.
Once the new parliament is in place, it will in December elect the government, with the seven posts traditionally shared among the major parties from right to left under a tacit decades-old agreement dubbed ""the magic formula"", aimed at ensuring political stability."

A report in the SonntagsZeitung this weekend suggested that in some areas of Switzerland up to 90 percent of migrants allocated to reception centres to await the processing of their asylum application flee the centre shortly after arriving.
Responding to the paper, the Federal Migration Office (SEM) did not confirm exact numbers but acknowledged that in the last three months between 20 and 40 percent of asylum seekers have left the system in this way, their whereabouts now unknown.
Confirming the information to news agency ATS, SEM spokeswoman Chloe Kohlprath said phenomenon was not new, and that many migrants took advantage of the system by saying they wished to claim asylum in Switzerland and then disappearing before their request could be formally registered.
Under European rules, refugees are only allowed to enter Switzerland if they say they want to claim asylum here. All those who do are allocated to a SEM reception centre to be registered.
Anyone who does not state their intention to claim asylum in Switzerland is refused entry and must return to the first European country they entered.
The Swiss have been under fire over the summer for turning back thousands of migrants at the border with Italy at Chiasso. Its strict adherence to the rules is an attempt to stop it becoming a ‘transit’ country for migrants who wish to pass through Switzerland on their way Germany in order to apply for asylum there.
According to the SEM, most of those who disappear from Swiss reception centres are thought to be heading for Germany, reported ATS.
As a result, there’s nothing to suggest that there are more illegals living in Switzerland, it said.
But Christoph Neuhaus, head of the justice department in the canton of Bern, told the SonntagsZeitung that the increase in ‘disappearing’ migrants over the summer was “highly problematic”.
“We cannot be sure that they really migrate further and register elsewhere as asylum seekers,” he said.
Albert Rösti, president of the Swiss People’s Party (SVP) called for the border to be shut down altogether, saying the situation was “a massive security risk”."

According to the “Tagesschau” programme of public broadcaster SRF, this is the lowest figure since the free movement of people accord with the ""old"" EU members came fully into effect in 2007.
The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) confirmed the figures, which were first published in the Sunday papers.
The figures show the number of citizens of EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries coming to Switzerland last year was 20 percent lower than the year before.
The peak year for immigration was 2008 when net migration – the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants – stood at almost 100,000 people.
Immigration has been steadily decreasing since 2014, when Switzerland voted to approve the initiative “against mass immigration” that sought to limit the number of migrants through quotas.
The SEM said the fall in immigration was clearest among the European countries that have traditionally supplied the labour market: Germany and Italy.
Daniel Bach of the SEM said this was connected to the economic situation in those countries.
“Spain and Portugal have seen a normalization of their economic situation with more jobs available and less unemployment, and Germany's strong growth means there is a high demand for labour there,” he said.
Bach said that the development of the Swiss economy and the economies of the EU countries would determine whether the trend towards lower immigration continued.
A little over two million foreigners lived in Switzerland last year, making up one quarter of the population."

					12:08 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Amnesty fears for child migrants at Italian border,"Amnesty International has asked the Swiss federal government to investigate reports that child migrants arriving at the Swiss-Italian border are being prevented from joining family in Switzerland.
For the past few weeks the Italian city of Como has seen hundreds of migrants camped out by its rail station after being sent back from the Swiss border at Chiasso, in the canton of Ticino.
If refugees apply for asylum when they arrive at the Swiss border they are allowed to stay and will be registered as an asylum seeker in Switzerland.
But many don't want to, wishing instead to travel through Switzerland and apply for asylum in another country, such as Germany.
Applying EU rules, Switzerland is sending those people back to the country they travelled from, in this case Italy.
But this strict adherence to the rules has not impressed Italy, with Como officials saying in July that the Swiss stance was turning the city into “an open-air refugee centre”.
Now the Swiss branch of Amnesty International has expressed concern after hearing reports that children were being turned back from the Swiss border.
“We are concerned about reports from minors who tell us they have been sent back to Italy from the Swiss border and therefore prevented from joining relatives in Switzerland,” the organization said in a statement obtained by The Local.
“We are asking for clarity from the Swiss authorities regarding the practice of sending back minors to Italy.”
But the Swiss authorities stressed that the rules haven't changed, and that any migrant has the right to request asylum at the Swiss border, reported news agencies on Thursday.
Martin Reichlin of the Swiss migration office (SEM) told news agencies that any child arriving at the border to join family members in Switzerland would be taken into the care of the SEM.
Speaking to The Local on Thursday, a spokesman for Amnesty International said they were “monitoring the situation closely” but “cannot make further comments in this volatile situation”.
Quoting figures from the Swiss border guards office, news agencies said 3,560 people were sent back from Switzerland to Italy in July alone.
Speaking to Swiss paper 24 Heures, MP Cesla Amarelle said Switzerland found itself “stuck in the middle”.
“Italy can't welcome all the migrants that reach its coasts and Germany has specifically asked Switzerland to not become an open corridor, as Austria has done.”
However, though the situation in Como “is not Calais”, it shouldn't be allowed to get worse and Switzerland should work with Italy to avoid that happening, she said."

the Mediterranean since the start of 2015, a 30-fold increase over the same period last year, the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said on Tuesday.
The grim new statistic followed the deaths of some 800 people on Sunday when a boat packed with migrants capsized near Libya in the deadliest Mediterranean shipping disaster for decades.
""IOM calculates the 2015 death toll now is more than 30 times last year's total at this date . . . when just 56 deaths of migrants had been reported on the Mediterranean,"" spokesman Joel Millman told reporters in Geneva.
""IOM now fears the 2014 total of 3,279 migrant (deaths) on the Mediterranean may be surpassed this year in a matter of weeks, and could well top 30,000 by the end of the year, based on the current death toll,"" he said.
UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said Sunday's migrant boat tragedy was ""the deadliest incident in the Mediterranean we have ever recorded.""
Edwards said there had been 1,300 deaths in April alone, making it the deadliest month on record.

The IOM spokesman said traffickers were increasingly packing in more people on overcrowded vessels, thereby greatly adding to the risk factor.
""The way we see it is that if there were 800 people on that fishing boat that sank . . . we can imagine that the same boat last year would have had 200 people on it,"" Millman said.
""If there's a real shortage of crafts they're going to do these reckless things,"" he said.
""If that's the case, and it appears to be, there is no reason not to be afraid that death rates could soar astronomically, because they are taking these measures to move people.""
Volker Turk, the director of international protection at the UN refugee agency, said most of the migrants taking the perilous journey were refugees.
""If you look at the numbers last year, over 50 percent of the people who crossed the Mediterranean were people in need of international protection — mostly Syrians, Eritreans, some Somalis,"" he said.
Italy, one of the frontline European states for illegal immigration, suspended its Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation late last year in protest over its rising cost.
That was replaced by a smaller and much more restricted EU-led mission called Triton.
""With the end of Mare Nostrum, we indeed unfortunately predicted the types of scenarios that are playing out today, and we hope that the European council meeting on Thursday will give adequate attention to the search and rescue dimension of this issue,"" Turk said."

Lisa Bosia Mirra, a Socialist party MP in Ticino's parliament, was arrested on Thursday at an unguarded border point at Stabio along with a 53-year-old man from the canton of Bern, police said in a statement.
The man was driving a van with Bern licence plates that contained four African refugee minors, said the statement. Mirra, in another car, is thought to have met them at the border.
They were both arrested just before 9am on Thursday after entering Swiss territory.
Mirra was released later that day but police said in a second statement she is “still under in investigation for breach of the Foreigners Act, in particular aiding and abetting illegal entry”.
The man who was driving the van remains in custody.
According to news agencies Mirra is the founder of a refugee aid organization, Firdaus, and has been critical of Switzerland's treatment of refugee children trying to enter the country at the border with Italy at Chiasso.
She also works with SOS Ticino, a non-profit aimed at promoting social justice with a particular focus on migration.
Switzerland has been under fire in recent weeks for turning back migrants, including children, at the border if they do not claim asylum.
The authorities want to stop the country becoming a route for migrants in transit who wish to pass through Switzerland and claim asylum in Germany.
As a result, thousands of refugees have been turned back from Chiasso and have ended up camping out in the Italian city of Como.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have expressed concern that child migrants wanting to reach family members already in Switzerland are being prevented from doing so.
And the Swiss Refugee Council recently said confusion at the border was making it difficult for refugees to claim asylum.
The Swiss border guards need to put more translators and child protection specialists in place to ensure those seeking to lodge an asylum request are able to do so, it said."

				19:15 CEST+02:00			 
					19:15 CEST+02:00				",Pierre Taillefer/AFP,SVP election result a 'triumph' for Blocher ,"The record performance by Switzerland's rightwing populist SVP in Sunday's elections marks a new triumph for its charismatic leader Christoph Blocher, a maverick politician known for his blustering speeches and virulent campaigns against immigration and closer ties with the EU.
The multi-billionaire art lover has become the SVP's godfather in recent years, remaining largely aloof from day-to-day party business in favour of defining the party line.
At 75, he is officially the vice president of the Swiss People's Party (SVP).
He did not run in the October 18th elections.
But he was heavily involved in the campaign, tirelessly criss-crossing the country to rally the crowds.
The SVP won 65 of the 200 seats in the lower house, up from 54 previously, and saw its support rise to its highest-ever level.
The party's gains were expected to tip the scale in parliament from the centre-left towards a centre-right majority.
But, true to his nonconformist image, Blocher afterwards avoided joining the politicians lining up to appear before television cameras.
The son of a Protestant preacher and the seventh of 11 children, he is widely credited with bankrolling the SVP and transforming it from a rural group into a powerful political machine anchored to the hard right, and today, Switzerland's largest party.
Until the 1990s, the SVP was the smallest of Switzerland's four leading parties, with just around ten percent of the vote, but since then it has soared to first place.
'Fake refugees'
Blocher has helped cement SVP's brand of populist nationalism focused heavily on purported threats from immigrants, in a country where a quarter of the population are foreign nationals.
Europe's current migrant crisis has given the party an additional boost, as it warns that the so far modest numbers of migrants and refugees arriving in Switzerland are set to balloon.
""Our country is in a better situation than its neighbours, in terms of the economy, freedoms and quality of life, but our prosperity is always threatened by the desire of other parties to make us enter the European Union,"" he said during the election campaign.
""The free movement of people, the chaos of asylum are also at the heart of my concerns.""
An opponent of the Schengen accords, which permit citizens of 26 European states to travel without passport formalities and to which Switzerland is a signatory, he said recently that ""we must set up border controls; it is not a question of closing the border but controlling the border.""
But he has also publicly softened some of his views recently.
""For people whose physical wellbeing or lives are threatened there will always be a place in Switzerland,"" he said at a meeting in Lausanne, referring to the wave of refugees arriving in Europe, but not for ""fake refugees"" who are motivated by economic reasons.
Pascal Sciarini, a political science professor at the University of Geneva, said the SVP ""is seen as the party which is most concerned about (immigration), and they don't even need to campaign because this migrant crisis is itself a campaign.
""The SVP has been quite clever in moderating its line a little bit, so as not to be too aggressive, because there is some solidarity with the migrants . . . but in anticipation of a change, they vote for the (SVP) to protect themselves against the risk of an invasion of migrants.""
After Blocher
In another success for Blocher, one of his three daughters, Magdalena Martullo-Blocher, was elected to parliament for the first time from a district where she had been forecast to lose for refusing to live there and quit as head of the family's chemicals business in the town of Ems, where she took over from her father.
""She brings business experience that a lot of lawmakers don't have,"" SVP president Toni Brunner said on Sunday night.
""I could well imagine Magdalena Martullo-Blocher on the Federal Council"", Switzerland's seven-member governing executive, said Brunner.
However, he believes ""it is definitely too early for her,"" as ""she has just arrived"" in the lower house of parliament.
It seems then that Blocher must still wait for family honour to be avenged.
When he was finally elected to join the Federal Council in 2003, Blocher was accused of not fitting into the Swiss government system, where ministers are drawn from all the major parties and are meant to seek consensus and stability.
And in 2007, the Swiss parliament, which picks the government ministers, did not reelect him.
A 50-year-old journalist, Roger Koeppel, editor-in-chief of the weekly Weltwoche, is now viewed as the party's heir-apparent.
He was elected for the first time on Sunday with 178,000 votes in Zurich, the largest votes of any lawmaker on Sunday.
""It is the end of the Blocher generation in Zurich,"" said Tages Anzeiger on Monday."

""The lack of concern that we see in many countries for the suffering and exploitation of such desperate people is deeply shocking,"" UN High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said at the start of talks on the issue in Geneva. He added: ""Rich countries must not become gated communities, their people averting their eyes from the bloodstains in the driveway."" A record 348,000 migrants and refugees took to leaky boats this year in search of a better life in Europe, South-East Asia, the Caribbean and the Middle East, 4,272 of them dying in the process, according to the UN refugee agency. Most of these were in the Mediterranean, where more than 207,000 made the crossing since January, almost three times the previous high of 70,000 during the Libyan civil war in 2011. A record 3,419 lost their lives. For the first time in decades, almost half of those hoping to make it to Europe are refugees rather than economic migrants, including 60,051 Syrians and 34,561 Eritreans. Others -- men, women and children — are being driven by lack of jobs, food and water, as well as natural disasters. ""If entire families are risking their lives at sea today, it's because they have already lost everything else and see no other option to find safety,"" said the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. ""In their place we would probably do the same thing,"" added Zeid. 'Sea of death' Many of those crossing the Mediterranean are towed on overcrowded boats behind ""mother ships"", which abandon them miles off the coast of Italy to sink or be rescued. The Italian navy saved about 160,000 people under its Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation, which ran between October 2013 and October this year, admiral Giuseppe De Giorgi told delegates. Rome ended the operation after fellow EU nations refused to help fund it, handing over to a more limited EU-run search and rescue mission known as Triton. Some critics argued that saving the migrants was simply encouraging them to try their luck. De Giorgi, the commander of the Italian navy, said his forces would continue to pursue smugglers. ""The Mediterranean Sea must not become a sea of death,"" he told delegates, calling for tougher measures against traffickers as well as more help for destination countries. Address the root causes Guterres convened the two-day meeting involving governments, NGOs and shipping groups in a bid to find ways to stop so many people taking to the seas. He said cracking down on traffickers was not enough -- efforts must also increase to address the reasons why people are fleeing their homes, and to improve the official channels through which they can move countries. An arc of conflict around Europe's southern, eastern and southeastern borders, in Libya, Ukraine, Syria and Iraq, is one reason so many people are heading to the continent. At the same time anti-immigration rhetoric is growing across the EU, fuelled by concerns about faltering economic growth and prompting calls for tougher border controls. ""At a time when an unprecedented number of people are forced to flee conflict and persecution across the world, barring them from accessing protection further afield is the opposite of what is needed,"" Guterres warned. He said: ""Any effective response must also address the root causes of this phenomenon."" While the Mediterranean is the most deadly route, it is by no means the only one. At least 242 people died in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden out of 82,680 people making the journey, most of them travelling from Ethiopia and Somalia to Yemen or onwards to Saudi Arabia or the Gulf states, the UNHCR said. About 540 people also died this year crossing the Bay of Bengal, out of a total of 54,000 making the journey, while another 71 deaths out of 4,775 crossings were reported in the Caribbean, the UNHCR said."

					18:14 CEST+02:00				",Morven McLean,Hiring discrimination dogs Swiss job market,"You apply for a job where you meet all the requirements but don't get called for an interview — is it because you are foreign, female or over 50?
Discrimination is not just a Swiss phenomenon but statistics as well as anecdotal evidence suggest it is common in Switzerland's job market. It can also be hard to prove.
Foreigners and second-generation immigrants tend to have more problems finding work than Swiss do, men earn more than women, and older workers are less desirable to employers. These are some of the ways in which discrimination is perceived.
A recent conference at Bern University of Applied Sciences got to grips with the issue, bringing together academics and Swiss policy makers to address gender and anti-migrant bias on the labour market and how to combat it.
One of the clearest ways in which discrimination is seen is in the differing wage levels of men and women in Switzerland.
Wage inequality may result from the fact that women take time out from their careers to have children, or work part-time as their children grow up, affecting their career development.
Panellist Christa Markwalder, a Liberal Party MP and National Council first vice-president, says there is a difference of 21 percent in the pay levels of men and women.
“Some of this difference is explained by maternity leave but a gap of nearly nine percent is unexplained,” the politician says, adding that even on first entering the labour market women are being paid at a lower level than men.
This applies to the better educated too. Federal Statistical Office data from 2011 shows that as early as one year after graduation women were earning less than men.
While there is evidence that the gender pay gap starts with the first job, it widens as employees take on more responsibility and move up the professional ladder, says Sylvie Durrer, director of the Federal Office of Gender Equality.
No wage transparency
Wage inequality persists into the 21st century in Switzerland partly because it is frowned upon to talk about what you earn, unlike in Israel, for instance, where people discuss salaries openly, one panellist commented.
“There is no tradition of talking about salary in Switzerland,” Markwalder agrees.
Durrer says that the lack of wage transparency in Switzerland meant it was very hard to know if the wage offered was compliant with the law on equal pay for equal work.
And employers are not helping in this respect.
“Many companies never make checks on wage equality,” says Durrer, whose Federal Office of Gender Equality has developed a tool for companies to ensure they treat staff equally.
“It's very important that companies make the analysis,” she says.
But there is no obligation under law for them to do so.
While a political debate is taking place over instruments to ensure equality on the labour market, Markwalder argues that government regulation should be kept to the minimum.
“The liberal labour market is one of Switzerland's assets,” she says, urging caution in introducing new instruments.
Instead, the onus should be on firms to take responsibility for treating employees equally, the Liberal MP says.
Problems of migrants
But discrimination may begin even earlier, at the job application stage.
Sascha O. Becker, professor of economics at the University of Warwick in the UK, says a study shows that youth with a migration background are less successful when it comes to applying for jobs.
The 2006 study involved sending fictitious CVs from equally qualified people of different ethnic backgrounds in response to job ads. While Portuguese in French-speaking Switzerland suffered a low level of discrimination, Albanian-speaking Yugoslavs were discriminated against in 59 percent of cases in the German part of Switzerland.
Foreigners also run a higher risk of joblessness in Switzerland, the study shows.
“Unemployment rates are much lower for Swiss citizens across the board. It seems to be harder for foreigners to find a job,” Becker says.
Felix Mbakaya, sitting in the audience, provides a perfect example of the problems experienced by young migrant workers in the Swiss labour market.
Despite having Swiss citizenship, the business administration student at Bern University of Applied Sciences has found it impossible to find suitable work.
Even offers to work for free in return for job experience have drawn a blank.
“I can't prove it's discrimination, but maybe my colour has something to do with it,” he tells The Local.
Mbakaya has lived in Switzerland for nine years, has had his Kenyan credentials accredited and speaks German. He says that all he wants is a chance to prove himself.
The panellists stress the importance of migrant workers for the Swiss economy, and suggest that their key to success on the labour market is a high level of education or completed apprenticeship.
Policy suggestions include a voluntary programme whereby job applicants from a migration background with a completed apprenticeship would receive two years employment by a company if they agree to pay back one month's salary per year of employment over a five-year period.
Mbakaya responds that companies should be free to employ who they want, but that they should be prepared to give migrant workers a chance.
“If someone is educated and wants to make a career here, why not give them a chance even if they don't have a Swiss background?”"

					10:58 CET+01:00				", The Local,Geneva reveals secret operation to legalize illegal workers,"In a first for Switzerland, nearly 600 illegal workers have been ‘regularized’ since 2015 in a secret operation in Geneva.
Code-named operation Papyrus, it aims to “lift institutional hypocrisy and put an end to the exploitation of people without papers,” said Geneva’s economy minister Pierre Maudet when the scheme was finally revealed to the press on Tuesday.
The Geneva authorities, workers’ unions and immigrant associations have for more than 15 years been striving to find a way of dealing with the numerous undocumented migrants working in the canton.
Most are from Latin America, the Balkans and the Philippines. Three quarters of them work in domestic service, others in restaurants or construction.
Many have been living and working in Switzerland for some time, supporting themselves and their families.
Operation Papyrus has been developed in secret over the past six years with the cooperation of federal authorities including justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga to help these people become legal and therefore end exploitation including low salaries and bad working conditions.
Since a test phase began at the end of 2015, 590 illegals from 147 families have been granted a B permit, a residency permit normally given to immigrants arriving to work.
A further 297 applications are being processed.
“The people we speak of today are certainly undocumented, but they lead a normal life,” Maudet told the press.
“They are financially autonomous and often have children educated in our schools. Despite that, they are sort of ghosts without a legal existence. This is about ending hypocrisy and validating what is already established”.
Papyrus has not required Geneva to change the law, but to soften certain criteria that are only vaguely defined in the Swiss law on foreigners, said Le Temps.
To apply for ‘regularization’ through Papyrus – which is not open to asylum seekers – candidates must have a job and be financially independent. Families with children must prove they have lived in Switzerland for five years; single people must have been here for ten.
They must not have broken the law and must be integrated, with a good level of French.
“Papyrus is not a collective regularization or an amnesty,” Cornelia Lüthy of the Swiss migration office (SEM) told the press. “Each case will be examined individually, with Bern having the final say”.
There is, therefore, a risk to the applicant that in applying for the scheme, they could be turned down and deported.
Consequently, organizations involved in the rights of foreigners will work with potential applicants to determine if they meet the criteria, before putting them forward officially, said Le Temps.
Those that are regularized must then give the authorities details of their employer, who may then be subjected to checks to ensure they are complying with employment law.
Potentially, the scheme could help 13,000 people in Geneva.
It will run for two years initially, with an evaluation mid-way through to assess in particular whether the scheme has caused an influx of unauthorized migrants to the canton.
Indeed, with around 76,000 undocumented workers in Switzerland as a whole, the risk is that some will seek to move to Geneva to take advantage of the scheme.
But speaking to Le Temps, Denise Efionayi-Mader, migration specialist from the University of Neuchatel, said that was unlikely.
“Employment is the anchor point for many illegals. The job market is not inexhaustible... it’s difficult to imagine that an illegal will quit their job and move to Geneva.
“Remember that it’s also difficult for someone without papers to move around easily,” she added.
Efionayi-Mader said she hoped the rest of Switzerland would eventually follow Geneva’s lead, so immigrants living in the country illegally would be treated equally across the country.
However, while some cantons such as Zurich may be inspired by Geneva’s project, others, such as the cantons of Ticino and Valais, which already have a hardened attitude towards foreigners, may become even more restrictive, she said.
Unions and immigrant groups involved in the development of the scheme hailed Papyrus as ""revolutionary"" and ""the best news for the rights of foreigners in a very long time,"" reported La Tribune de Geneve."

The ongoing debate in Switzerland over whether the Swiss football team is ‘Swiss enough' has been given unwanted new life by a key figure in the sport's national federation.
“Maybe it should be asked: do we want dual nationals?” said the federation's general secretary (SFV) Alex Miescher in a recent interview with the Tages Anzeiger newspaper.
Read also: Increasingly international - number of Swiss dual nationals soars
The comment came after three Swiss footballers, including Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri who have a Kosovo Albanian background, celebrated goals scored against in a World Cup match against Serbia with a hand gesture representing the “double eagle” of the Albanian flag.
The gesture divided the increasingly international Swiss public, many of whom are dual nationals.
Some supported the players whose families had come to Switzerland during the 1998-1999 war between Kosovo ethnic Albanian pro-independence guerrilla and Serbian forces. Others, meanwhile, said it showed that the players loyalties were divided.
The controversy appeared to die down but the comments from SFV general secretary Alex Miescher have escalated the situation.
“The incident with the double eagle shows there is a problem,” said the federation's second in command, suggesting only players who gave up their second nationality should be entitled to participate in trainee programs.
Although these comments were authorised by the SFV, the federation backtracked on Saturday. In a statement, it distanced itself from the debate by saying no one within the SFV had spoken out against dual nationality.
But it appears the damage has already been done. With around two thirds of the Swiss national team having a foreign background, and many having dual nationality, the comments have been greeted with anger.
“I hear in his [Miescher's] words that he doesn't trust dual nationals to give their all for Switzerland,” said Granit Xhaka in an interview published in the Blick newspaper.
“Just after we experienced a tough defeat in Russia, you don't do that,” he said.
“We are all Swiss and give everything for the Swiss national team – all of us, because we know, and are thankful for, everything Switzerland had done for us and our families,” he said in response to what he described as “Stone Age commentary” by the SFV general secretary.
Miescher's comments are unlikely to put an end to ongoing debate about the status of the Swiss football team, often attacked by conservatives as being too foreign.
The comments are also part of a larger debate over dual nationals in Switzerland.
While more than one in five Swiss citizens now holds a second passport – a number that has soared 40 percent to 1.48 million in the last decade – members of the conservative Swiss People's Party have periodically called for the right to dual nationality for Swiss people to be either limited or scrapped, arguing that the holding of two passports can mean reduced loyalty to Switzerland."

Switzerland narrowly voted for the unspecified curbs in early 2014 with implementation to be made before February 2017.
The issue is newly topical as Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War and Britain seeks migrant restrictions of its own to stay in the EU.
Swiss Federal President Simonetta Sommaruga said after talks in Brussels with European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker that both sides wanted an accord but it was easier said than done.
""We have cleared the ground but we have no solution . . . there is still a difficult way to go and a lot of work to be done,"" Sommaruga told reporters.
""We might succeed, we might not.""
Juncker said it was in the interests of both sides to find agreement.
""We hope that by February we will be able to set out what progress has been made,"" he said.
""We are confident of reaching an agreement.""
The Swiss vote in February 2014 jeopardized years of close ties with the 28-nation European Union, which is founded on the core principle of free movement for all its citizens.
Switzerland is not an EU member state but it signed the Schengen agreement, agreeing to become part of Europe's passport-free zone which has come under huge pressure as the migrant
crisis has deepened this year.
In February, the Swiss government presented legislation to try and reconcile voters' wishes with EU rules by allowing in migrants under specific exceptions to some of the restrictions.
Around 80,000 immigrants, most from the EU, have settled in Switzerland annually in the past few years and almost a quarter of its 8.2 million people are foreign nationals."

On Thursday the Swiss upper house of parliament backed a motion by Liberal-Radical Damian Müller in which he asked the Swiss government to examine the problem, reported news agencies.
According to the text of Müller's motion, some migrants are refused asylum but then manage to avoid being deported, including some who are criminal offenders or may have jihadist sympathies and therefore pose a terror threat.
The Swiss government should find ways to improve current deportation rates and ensure that potentially dangerous people whose deportation is delayed are sufficiently monitored, he said.
The report should also examine whether the costs for this should be borne by the federal government rather than the cantons.
Addressing the issue, justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga said there was no “recipe” for combatting terrorism and that just because someone is refused asylum doesn't mean they are a terrorist.
But the Council of States supported Müller's request.
It will be addressed by the Federal Council as part of a report on police measures related to the fight against terror."

The growth rate for foreigners in Switzerland (2.6 percent) was slightly higher than in 2015, however it has been much higher in the recent past, reaching 4.2 percent in 2008.
More foreign babies were born in Switzerland last year than ever before (26,313) while fewer foreign residents died in 2016 than in the previous year, resulting in a ‘natural growth’ – the difference between the number of births and deaths – of 20,060.
In addition, 167,407 foreigners chose to make Switzerland home in 2016, while just over 90,000 left the country.
In comparison, the number of Swiss who left the country in 2016 was higher than the number who came back.
What’s more, due to the wider age demographic of Swiss citizens, their ‘natural growth’ was only 2,859.
Italians remain the largest diaspora within Switzerland, followed by Germans, Portuguese and French.
Since babies born to foreign citizens in Switzerland do not automatically get Swiss citizenship, the figures in the table below also include Swiss-born foreigners.

The saga surrounding the Chelsea owner's attempt to relocate to the country was first reported by the Tribune de Geneve (TdG) newspaper, which claimed Abramovich was turned away after Swiss police claimed he posed a security risk.
In a rare move, the TdG newspaper published the article in both French and English, highlighting Abramovich's high profile internationally. The story was also published in English by other newspapers in the Tamedia group, which owns the TdG,
Abramovich had applied for residency in Valais canton, which includes the luxury ski resort of Verbier, Jacques de Lavallaz, the head of the cantonal migration service, told the AFP new agency in an email.
Valais gave Abramovich the green light, de Lavallaz said, but federal authorities have the final say on Swiss migration decisions.
""The (federal) secretariat of migration was going to make a negative decision but Mr. Abramovich's representatives withdrew their client's application before a decision was issued,"" de Lavallaz said.
The migration secretariat's decision was based on an analysis conducted by Swiss federal police, de Lavallaz explained, without discussing details of their conclusions.
He stressed that the application was withdrawn before a final decision was rendered.
According to the TdG, Abramovich applied to move to Verbier in 2016.
The newspaper said that police argued he was linked to ""alleged money laundering and alleged contacts to criminal organisations.""
Police claimed ""that Abramovich's presence in the country would constitute a reputational risk for Switzerland – and possibly even a public security risk,"" the newspaper further reported.
The newspaper also posted a statement from an individual identified as Abramovich's lawyer, criticising Swiss officials and the release of his personal information.
""We have filed a request for correction of facts to the Swiss Federal Police and will be filing a criminal complaint against unknown persons responsible for dissemination of this confidential information,"" the lawyer, Daniel Glasl, said in the statement.
""Any suggestion that Mr. Abramovich has been involved in money laundering or has contacts with criminal organisations is entirely false,"" he added.
It also noted that Abramovich has no criminal record.
The TdG said Swiss police raised concern over a commodities trading company that had been controlled by Abramovich called Runicom, which was the subject of a money laundering investigation by Geneva prosecutors in the 1990s.
Glasl stressed that the company was ""long-ago cleared of any wrongdoing.""
The TdG said that Switzerland's federal court gave it permission last week to publish the story, after a seven month legal battle with Abramovich's lawyers.
Abramovich, who bought Chelsea in 2003, was granted Israeli citizenship earlier this year after the British authorities reportedly delayed approving a visa for him."

According to figures received by news agency ATS from the Swiss border guards office (EZV) on Monday, 1,321 people entered Switzerland illegally via a border in the canton of Ticino between July 4th and 10th.
Of those, the largest number (665) were Eritrean.
In 996 cases they were sent back over the border, since those who enter the country illegally are not considered as having refugee status.
Those who requested asylum were sent to one of Switzerland's asylum centres for processing.
In total, 14,602 people tried to enter the country illegally in the first four months of 2016, up from 10,362 during the same period last year.
Most of them came through the border with Italy in the canton of Ticino.
The border at Chiasso has long seen high numbers of people attempting to enter Switzerland illegally, and numbers are on the rise.
In late June, the situation led the president of Ticino's government, Norman Gobbi, to call for the border to be shut altogether.
Speaking at the time, Gobbi said other countries including Italy were not properly abiding by the Dublin system, which requires immigrants to be registered at their first point of entry to the Schengen zone, of which Switzerland is a part.
Other cantons are also considering sending border guards to Ticino to help out.
Last week Ticino's border guards made international headlines when an Eritrean immigrant was busted trying to smuggle himself over the border in a suitcase.
Switzerland has around 24,000 Eritreans living in the country (2014 figures), the largest diaspora outside the North African country itself."

On the Move, a nationwide survey on immigration, is due to be published next year but initial results were revealed by Blick on Monday as part of the paper’s week-long focus on foreigners in Switzerland.
Led by the universities of Neuchâtel and Geneva, the survey asked 6,000 immigrants of 11 nationalities (from across Europe, North and South America, India and West Africa) how they felt about living in Switzerland.
Some 35 percent said they had experienced discrimination here, not always because of their status as a foreigner but also due to their gender, race and age.
Nevertheless, the vast majority (90 percent) said they were satisfied or very satisfied that they came here, according to Blick.
Some 70 percent of those questioned said coming to Switzerland had been a professional advantage and they were in a better situation than in their home country.
The figure was higher (75 percent) for people from the southern European countries Portugal, Italy and Spain, but less pronounced for British people and those from North and South America.

Most immigrants (62 percent) said they came to Switzerland for professional reasons, with 38 percent saying it was to change their lifestyle or have new experiences. Twenty-nine percent cited family reasons and eight percent education.
But the stats varied widely depending on the country of origin, with 65 percent of Brits saying they came here for professional reasons compared with only around 20 percent of West Africans and South Americans.

The survey also questioned immigrants about their feelings towards Switzerland and their home countries.
Despite living in the alpine country, over half (52 percent) said they still felt a strong attachment to their home country.
Two notable exceptions were the French and the South Americans, a majority of whom said they felt a stronger attachment to Switzerland than to their home country.
The Portuguese, Austrians and Germans felt least attached to Switzerland, at 30 percent.
Speaking to Blick, researcher Philippe Wanner said the strength of feeling towards Switzerland depended on how the immigrant viewed their move – for example, if migration is considered a professional opportunity, the feeling of connection to the adopted country is stronger.
That explains why the French, who often come to Switzerland because they are dissatisfied with France, feel a strong attachment to their adopted country while the Portuguese, who usually come out of necessity, do not.
“The degree of affinity with Switzerland does not say anything about the level of integration of migrants,” he stressed.

Just under half of those questioned said they wanted to become Swiss, though the results varied considerably depending on where the immigrant was from.
West Africans and South Americans were more likely to want to pursue Swiss citizenship (69 percent and 62 percent respectively). At the other end of the scale a majority of Austrians and Portuguese said they did not want to become Swiss. The Austrian result could be partly explained by the fact that Austria does not allow double nationality.
Among those who said they wanted to become Swiss, 26 percent said it was because they wanted to vote, 25 percent because they felt attached to Switzerland, while 22 percent cited practical reasons.
Introducing its series of articles on foreigners in Switzerland, Blick editor Andreas Dietrich said “we should not forget the contribution that foreigners make” to the country.
“There are Swiss people who would prefer to live without foreigners,” he added. “Such a Switzerland has never existed and thankfully will never exist. That would be a country where we would feel alien.”

Pascale Baeriswyl of the Swiss foreign affairs department stood before the panel in Geneva to defend Switzerland's human rights record as part of the UN's universal periodic review system, a four-yearly process in which every member state must outline what it has done and is still doing to improve human rights.
The Swiss government's plan to establish a national human rights institution – a draft bill for which was opened for consultation earlier this year – was hailed by several UN member states, reported news agencies.
An independent body attached to one or more of Switzerland's higher education institutions, it would serve to protect and promote human rights in the country.
However several countries called on Switzerland to work harder to combat racism, xenophobia and intolerance, pointing to the rise of the “extreme right”.
A national plan or even a new law to protect against discrimination, particularly towards migrants, should be considered, said some, a suggestion Baeriswyl rejected, saying current legislation was sufficient.
Switzerland was also criticized for not yet adopting the European convention on preventing and combating violence against women, though parliament is currently working towards its ratification.
Speaking to the panel Baeriswyl said Switzerland considered itself to have a good level of human rights but that “no country should be complacent” and protecting these rights was a continual process.
The review panel will compile a report, due next week, before Switzerland must say which of the panel's recommendations it agrees to pursue."

In December Fifa -- based in Zurich -- asked John Ruggie, a former UN special representative on business and human rights, to assess its human rights efforts as the organization faced mounting criticism over the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
""Fifa has been beset by allegations about human rights abuses in connection with its events and relationships,"" said the report by the Harvard University specialist.
""Prominent among them have been reported deaths among migrant construction workers in Qatar, which was awarded the 2022 Men's World Cup, and the country's kafala system that often leaves migrant workers in situations of bonded labour.
""Other tournaments have raised concerns about forced evictions of poor communities to make way for stadiums and other infrastructure, and clamp-downs on freedom of expression among citizens and journalists.""
Ruggie raised tough questions about Fifa's consideration of human rights when choosing tournament hosts and highlighted a decision to stage the Women's Under-20 World Cup in Papua New Guinea in November-December this year.
""Papua New Guinea is known as one of the world's worst places for sexual violence against women and police are often among the perpetrators,"" said the report.
Fifa's decisions have ""left individuals and communities vulnerable and Fifa's own reputation exposed,"" Ruggie said as he exposed gaps in Fifa's management and policies.
""At this time, Fifa does not yet have adequate systems in place enabling it to know and show that it respects human rights in practice,"" he said.
Fifa 'not doing enough'
Ruggie said the world body, also facing widespread condemnation over corruption scandals in football, must quickly integrate human rights principles into its practices for the selection of the 2026 World Cup host.
The bidding campaign has been suspended because of the bribery scandals that have beset football. It is due to start this year however.
""Fifa is not responsible for all human rights abuses by organizations it works with, or any country in which its events are staged,"" said Ruggie.
""But it is responsible for its own involvement with such risks, whether the connection is through its events, commercial subsidiaries and business partners, members or other parties.""
Ruggie said that Fifa is not doing enough to put human rights in accords with the host countries of World Cup and other events, nor to put pressure on those countries when there are problems.
Without naming any current World Cup host country, Ruggie said: ""Where Fifa is unable to reduce severe human rights impacts by using its leverage, it should consider suspending or terminating the relationship.""
If it could not do this it had to clearly explain why, he added.
Ruggie said Fifa should work with ""local stakeholders, sponsors, international organizations, and others"" to put pressure on governments.
""The option of ending a relationship itself is an important source of leverage and should be clearly communicated to bidders, suppliers, licensees and other relevant entities,"" said the report.
""Like any other enterprise, Fifa needs to be able to terminate a relationship if peoples' human rights are abused. This means writing it into its agreements for World Cup tournaments from the start,"" Ruggie told AFP.
""Fifa is fully committed to respecting human rights,"" Fifa president Gianni Infantino said in a statement welcoming Ruggie's report. But he acknowledged that ""of course challenges remain"".
Infantino said that Fifa wants to be ""a leader among international sports organizations."""

The total number of foreign citizens, permanent and non-permanent residents, reached 2,068,455, according to figures released on July 26th by the Swiss government.
With 407,453 foreign residents, the canton of Zurich hosts by far the largest foreign community. The cantons of Vaud, Geneva and Bern also host a large number of foreign residents.

The news will be a relief to several cantons that earlier this year demanded an increase in permits, saying the low number available was damaging to businesses.
Unlike foreigners arriving in Switzerland from the EU, who have the right to work here under a bilateral agreement granting free movement, workers from outside the EU – so-called third states – are subject to quotas.

However after the 2014 anti-immigration vote, the Swiss federal government reduced the quota of third-state permits for 2015 and 2016 by a quarter.
The number of permits was raised for 2017 but still fell short of 2014 levels.
In a joint letter to the government in August, the cantons of Geneva, Basel-City and Zurich – which together make up a third of Switzerland's economy – said they had used up their quota of permits by the end of the first trimester of this year and demanded the number be increased.
“The low level of quotas leads to uncertainty for the authorities and businesses, which isn't favourable to our economic development,” they said.
While domestic and EU workers make up a large part of the workforce, companies must be able to call on workers from third states, particularly specialists in research and development, added the letter. If not, there would be an “increased risk that projects will be moved abroad or that companies decide not to come to Switzerland”.

Brussels said the vote would further complicate thorny negotiations over a national vote in early 2014 in which Switzerland voted for similar curbs, despite them violating the EU's free movement rules.
""The EU and Switzerland have been in intense talks for months now in order to find a solution on how to implement the Swiss popular vote on free movement in a way that respects obligations under the free movement agreement,"" said Margaritis Schinas, spokesman for commission head Jean-Claude Juncker.

Switzerland is not an EU member but is signed up to the bloc's Schengen agreement, which allows passport-free travel and free movement of workers.
The referendum in Ticino was presented by the conservative Swiss People's Party. The vote's result still requires approval from the Swiss federal government.
However Bern is unlikely to look kindly at the Ticino vote, as it struggles to repair frayed relations with the EU and figure out how to apply the 2014 vote.
The EU is keen to take a hard line on Switzerland shirking its duties from bilateral agreements ahead of the bloc's negotiations with London over its departure from the bloc.

					23:07 CET+01:00				",AFP,Report confirms Nestlé ties to slave labour,"Swiss food giant Nestlé is vowing to stamp out any forced labour used in its supply chain in Thailand after a probe confirmed workers were toiling in slave-like conditions to catch and process fish for the company's products.
""Nestlé is committed to eliminating forced labour in our seafood supply chain in Thailand,"" executive vice president of operations Magdi Batato said in a statement sent to AFP on Tuesday.
Vevey-based Nestlé had commissioned non-governmental organization Verité to investigate working conditions among its suppliers of fish in Thailand following allegations they were using slave labour.
The Verité report concluded that forced labour and other human rights abuses were ""endemic"" and posed an ""urgent challenge to any company sourcing seafood"" in Thailand.
In some cases, impoverished illegal migrants trafficked from places like Myanmar and Cambodia were tricked and ""sold"" to fishing vessels where they worked virtually non-stop in dire conditions, receiving little or no pay.
The workers questioned for the investigation, conducted over three months at six production sites, testified to ""horrible and dangerous"" conditions, describing physical violence, intimidation and threats.
Workers were sometimes forced to sleep on the floor when they were allowed to rest, and had limited access to water, medicine and sometimes food, the report found.
Their passports or ID cards were often taken to ensure they would not leave before their contract ends, and their wages were often withheld for months while they were at sea.
This sometimes resulted in them or their families taking high-interest loans from the employer, and landing them in debt bondage, the report said.
Verité faulted the lack of transparency in the supply chain, with boat workers often isolated at sea for months at a time at the mercy of their captain and no possibility to communicate with the outside world.
The NGO urged Nestlé and other companies to strengthen ""supply chain mapping and traceability efforts, making current monitoring and capacity building initiatives more robust.""
Nestlé commissioned the Verité report after pet food buyers in the United States filed a class action lawsuit in California claiming they would not have purchased Nestlé's Fancy Feast products had they known they had ties to slave labour.
The Swiss food giant countered at the time that it required ""all of our suppliers to respect human rights and to comply with all applicable labour laws.""
However, it said it would ask Verité to investigate, acknowledging that enforcing its strict code of conduct throughout the complex, multi-layered supply-chain in the Thai seafood industry that supplies some ingredients for its products was a challenge.
After seeing Verité's conclusions, Nestlé said it had launched a ten-point action plan, including setting up an emergency response team to quickly help individuals at risk.
The plan, which Nestlé said it would begin implementing immediately, also includes a programme aimed at verifying the working conditions on fishing vessels, a programme to train boat captains in best practices and a system aimed at improving the traceability of seafood ingredients used in the
company's products."

“If, for fear of their husband or ignorance of the Swiss legal system, migrants do not make police or doctors certify the abuse, their chances are minimal.” The report said that evidence from a women's shelter centre or the testimony of neighbours are still rarely taken into consideration by the authorities, even though there are signals that this will change in the future.
“We often meet women who continue to stay with their violent husbands so they won’t have to go back to their home country,” said Claudia Hauser of DAO (Organisation faîtière des maisons d’accueil pour femmes de Suisse et du Liechtenstein).
According to the report, figures from the Federal Statistics Office show that 22 women, both immigrant and Swiss, die every year following domestic abuse. Nearly 20 per cent of women living in Switzerland suffer from psychological or sexual violence in their life."

The 13-episode series is being filmed by a Nigerian film crew in Nigeria and Switzerland with the alpine country picking up the $450,000 price tag, news agencies reported on Monday.
The series, called Missing Steps, came out of a 2011 migration agreement between the two countries which saw Nigeria pledge to help citizens who want to voluntarily return to the African nation.
The story follows a Nigerian man who comes to Switzerland and realizes that life isn't as good as he thought it would be.
Speaking to The Local on Wednesday, SEM spokesman Lukas Rieder said it wasn't about dissuading Nigerians but giving them objective information.
“We have seen that a lack of information or false information is one of the main problems that leads to illegal migration,” he said.
""Human traffickers tell potential migrants that Switzerland is paradise, it's Eldorado. But that's not true. We want to provide objective information about the dangers of passage, and the dangers of living in Switzerland without a permit, for example"".
Official campaigns have a limited reach and people are often skeptical about them, he said. Whereas using the Nigerian film industry – known as ‘Nollywood' – could be an effective way of reaching as many people as possible.
However the plan hasn't convinced the Swiss Refugee Council, which told the media that awareness campaigns like these were not enough by themselves.
It would be better to treat the causes of migration, such as the human rights situation and economic issues, said a spokesman.
In 2009, the UN said Nollywood had surpassed Hollywood to become the second largest film producer behind India's Bollywood.
It produces some 2,000 films a year, most of them on a shoestring budget.
Its latest success is comedy The Wedding Party which has broken box office records in the country and was shown at international film festivals including Toronto."

					20:53 CEST+02:00				",AFP,Swiss minister calls for new asylum rules ,"A growing flood of migrants arriving in southern Europe is raising questions about the continent's system for dealing with asylum seekers, Swiss Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said on Thursday.
The Dublin Convention, which requires migrants to claim asylum in the first European country they arrive in, should be ""re-examined"", the minister told journalists in Bern, the ATS news agency reported. The migrant burden is being borne disproportionately, Sommaruga said, with Italy carrying the heaviest load. She said that, with between 1,000 and 2,000 asylum seekers arriving in Italy every day, the system — which non-EU member Switzerland is party to — had come under intense pressure. Sommaruga said asylum seekers could be spread more evenly across Europe, depending upon the wealth and population size of the host countries. But such a solution was unlikely to receive much backing, she acknowledged, even in wealthy Switzerland, following a string of referendums in recent years hostile to immigration. The country has faced a recent surge in the number of asylum seekers, with dozens arriving each day to already overflowing asylum centres. Altering the convention will not be easy, the Social Democrat admitted. ""I have never yet heard a reasonable proposal that could serve as an alternative."" There are currently no plans to revise or replace the convention. Switzerland's largest party, the populist rightwing Swiss People's Party (SVP), recently said it would push for a popular vote aimed at restricting the right to seek asylum to those who arrive in the country by plane. The SVP argued that since Switzerland is surrounded by EU countries, anyone arriving by land would necessarily be coming from a ""safe"" country, ruling out their asylum claim. Sommaruga rejected that argument as callous, insisting that such a restriction would stop fleeing migrants from coming to Switzerland. Swiss authorities have said they expect some 24,000 asylum seekers to arrive in the country this year, up 11 percent from 2013."

Speaking to Swiss tabloid Blick, SVP party president Albert Rösti said 125,000 signatures had been collected for the anti-freedom of movement initiative.
These will now need to be officially verified before the initiative is submitted, expected to be in September.
Under Swiss law, any group of at least seven citizens that collects 100,000 signatures within 18 months can demand a change to the constitution via referendum.

If the SVP referendum does go ahead and receives the backing of the Swiss people, it would mean EU citizens would no longer have the automatic right to work in Switzerland.
Rösti said freedom of movement “is damaging to prosperity [in Switzerland] in the long run” and denied that scrapping the freedom of movement deal with the EU would cause major damage to relations with Brussels.
The comments from the SVP chief ramp up the pressure on the Swiss government, coming as they do on the same day that Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis is expected to unveil a new deal designed to break the deadlock in stalled talks between Bern and Brussels on a new framework agreement regarding their bilateral arrangements.
Tensions between the Bern and the Brussels date back to 2014 when Swiss voters backed another SVP-powered referendum – the ‘against mass immigration' initiative –which aimed to impose limits on immigration from EU countries and therefore protect the rights, and high incomes, of Swiss workers.
Aware that implementing the measures restricting EU freedom of movement contained in the referendum text could seriously threaten Swiss access to the European Common Market, the Swiss parliament finally approved a watered-down version of the initiative.
This involved imposing new rules on unemployment which should limit the impact of foreign workers on the domestic job market.
But the parliament's decision to pass a “lite” version of the mass immigration initiative angered the SVP while it failed to fully satisfy Brussels over the issue of access of EU workers to the Swiss job market.
Under the new deal expected to be proposed by the foreign minister to the Swiss government on Wednesday, Bern would make concessions to the EU by tweaking its eight-day rule which requires foreign companies to inform Swiss authorities at least eight days before they carry out work in Switzerland so that the Swiss can ensure firms are not bringing in cheaper labour to undercut high wages in the Alpine country.
In exchange, Brussels would accept a more limited role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Swiss affairs."

Maurer, a member of the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP), told newspaper SonntagsBlick that he wasn't surprised about the Paris attacks and that such an attack in Switzerland “is no longer totally abstract, but conceivable”.
He spoke of the need to strengthen border controls using the help of the army, saying such measures were “politically taboo” but “necessary”.
He also told SonntagsBlick that the Schengen and Dublin agreements with the EU “obviously do not work”.
On Saturday the country stepped up police presence at rail stations and French diplomatic buildings, and increased border controls between France and Switzerland.
But these steps are not enough, according to the SVP, which met in Bern on Saturday.
In a statement published on its website, the party expressed its “deep worry over the terrible terrorist acts committed in Paris and also over the uncontrolled wave of immigration in Europe.”
The party said it was “in favour of a strong army to guard the security of this country and its inhabitants” and asked the federal government “to immediately guarantee the security of national borders and stop illegal entry.”
Some on the political left reacted in anger to the SVP's linking of the Paris attacks with the migrant crisis in Europe.
“I find it pitiful that the SVP uses the drama in Paris to recycle its obsessions,” Green politician Robert Cramer told the Tribune de Genève.
Socialist Pierre-Alain Fridez said the use of the army shouldn't be ruled out, the Tribune.
But he said such a move should only be made if it is proven that terrorists are using the same channels as asylum seekers and border guards are in real need of help.
“The most important thing is to continue to respect the rights and dignity of migrants,” he said.
According to Vigipol, a coordinated security plan implemented by police in French-speaking cantons, no concrete threat exists towards Switzerland at the moment but “the risk of isolated copycat actions by disturbed individuals cannot be completely ruled out”, reported the Tribune de Genève.
Since the federal elections on October 18th the SVP holds 65 of the 200 seats in the Swiss parliament's lower house, making it the country's biggest party.
The party also looks likely to get a key second seat in the country's seven-member cabinet after the resignation of finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf."

Part of the organization's Best Countries survey – in which Switzerland came top overall – the ‘Best Countries to be an Immigrant' ranking analyzed the responses to four specific survey categories relevant to immigration: ‘economically stable', ‘good job market', ‘income equality' and ‘is a place I would live'.
Countries were also scored on the share of migrants in their population and the amount of money earned, as well as a UN assessment of integration measures provided for immigrants, such as language training and transfers of job certifications.
Switzerland placed third, behind Sweden and Canada, partly due to its perception as having a stable economy and good integration measures, said US News & World Report in a press release.
The alpine country now has over two million immigrants – a quarter of its population – with many attracted by multinational companies promising high salaries and an excellent standard of living.
Relatively low unemployment, the strong Swiss franc and a need for highly qualified workers have all contributed to rising immigration.

However it's not all rosy.
A backlash against immigrants led by Switzerland's largest political party – the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) – resulted in a controversial anti-immigration vote in 2014 and two years of subsequent political wrangling over the rights of EU citizens in Switzerland.
And in a 2016 Expat Insider study 36 percent of immigrants in Switzerland said the Swiss attitude towards foreign residents was generally bad, compared to the global average of 17 percent.
Switzerland's ranking in that study fell sharply to 31st, after being as high as fourth in previous years, with immigrants particularly criticizing their adopted country for the difficulty of settling in and making local friends.
The country was praised for its healthcare, safety, transport and job security but slammed for unfriendly attitudes, the difficulty of integrating into local culture and the high cost of childcare.
Another 2016 survey painted a similar picture, saying while most foreigners in Switzerland earned high salaries and felt confident about the country's political and economic stability, they found it difficult to make friends and have a social life.

The Swiss National Science Foundation carried out research on over 5,000 children born in the German-speaking region of Switzerland. While they did not necessarily receive lower grades than their Swiss peers, they were still not often enrolled in high schools – expecting to go to university.
The main reasons for their failure to attend university were financial and cultural problems at home, where education might not be considered a priority, and added that often the language barriers also played a role.
Children of immigrants from Turkey, Portugal and the Balkans were singled out in the study as disadvantaged, while children born to immigrants from France, Germany and Austria are more likely to succeed thanks to their more comfortable socio-economic background, it said.
The Foundation said the failure of immigrant children to go to university was harmful to the Swiss economy:
“Individuals who would be able to achieve results but come from disadvantaged family backgrounds do not realize their full potential - which happens more often in Switzerland than in some neighboring countries.”
The study said there is no evidence that teachers or the school system in general are discriminating against migrant children."

The most powerful woman in the world will meet with Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga and three of her ministers in Bern where they will discuss the state of Swiss-EU relations 18 months after Switzerland voted in favour of limiting immigration, according to newspaper Le Temps.
The Swiss government is still grappling with how to deal with the repercussions of the February 9th 2014 referendum in which the Swiss people narrowly passed a proposal to introduce immigration quotas.
The vote contradicts Switzerland's participation in the Schengen agreement on the free movement of people, a fundamental EU principle, and places the future of many EU-Swiss bilateral agreements in question.
While Merkel is not expected to change her position on the issue, this rare official visit will be welcomed by the Swiss federal government as part of its diplomatic efforts to incur “a little understanding” from its influential neighbours in the hope of opening negotiations with the European Commission, said Le Temps.
Other topics on the agenda will be the worsening migrant crisis across Europe, the war in Ukraine and Swiss-German bilateral agreements in the fields of energy and transport.
Merkel and Sommaruga are expected to see eye to eye on the question of asylum and the current migrant crisis.
Both are pushing for a wide reform of the Schengen agreement and want European countries to commit to taking their share of refugees, said Le Temps.
Back in May Sommaruga said Switzerland would be willing to adopt an EU migration proposal for the even geographical distribution of asylum seekers across Europe.
In August she faced pressure from Lucerne cantonal authorities over what it saw as Switzerland's “overly generous” asylum policy and the subsequent influx of Eritrean refugees to the region.
But the Swiss President said it was “unthinkable” that Switzerland should send Eritreans back to their authoritarian home country.
Merkel, who last visited Switzerland in 2008, will also speak at the university of Bern where she will finally receive the honorary doctorate she was awarded by the university in 2009.

This is just one of the incidents described into a new report on racism in Switzerland.
In another example, the manager of a public swimming pool turns off hot water at the facility so that “dark-skinned” people can’t shower. Internal guidelines at the baths “warn” that migrants only come to the pool to shower and cause problems.
Both of the above incidents come from the report which examines racists incidents reported to a network of 27 bureaus assisting victims of racism across Switzerland.

The report, published jointly by the Federal Commission against Racism (FCR) and Swiss human rights portal humanrights.ch shows the number of racist incidents reported last year in Switzerland was a record high 301. That’s compared to 199 a year earlier and well above the previous peak in the last ten years of 249.
Commenting on the high figure last year, report co-author David Mühlemann noted that most racist incidents never go reported.
He also said the 2017 rise could possibly be due to greater awareness among people affected by racism or better access to advice bureaus.
But Mühlemann also warned the figure “could also be an indication of an actual increase in incidents.” He said far-right political parties across Europe had made extreme positions more socially acceptable, adding “Many people no longer feel bound to social conventions and are openly racist.”
Most of the incidents in the 2017 related to general hostility to foreigners (112), while racism against black people accounted for 95 cases and Muslims were the targets of incidents in 54 cases.
The vast majority of the incidents were verbal in nature: however, in two cases weapons were involved.

The reports’ authors also highlighted a rise in reported incidents in the sphere of education, which accounted for 42 cases, or twice as many as the previous year.
FCR President Martine Brunschwig Graf said the education system needed to do more to tackle the problem, noting that teachers received very little specific training and that the word “racism” did not appear once in the new Lehrplan 21 project which aims to harmonise school syllabuses across Swiss German-speaking Switzerland.
In one incident described in the 2017 report, a ten-year old who came to school with stomach pains was called “little nigger”, while classmates asked why he stank and told him he had Ebola.
“It’s exactly at this age that we can work well with children and young people,” said Giorgio Andreoli who heads up the “Together against Violence and Racism” group which visits schoolchildren in the canton of Bern to highlight the problem of racism.
Experts also warned that the police focus on Islamic extremism, even at the school level, meant the problem of far-right extremism was not receiving enough attention in Switzerland."

The report by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) paints a rosy picture of the impact of the free movement of people in the EU and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) on the Swiss job market and social security system.
Read also: Here are the jobs that need filling in Switzerland
It reveals the numbers of workers arriving in Switzerland from the EU and EFTA is falling as the economic situation across the EU picks up.
Falling numbers of foreign workers
In 2017, net migration to Switzerland from EU and EFTA countries was 31,250, down 11 percent on 2016 and 54 percent lower than the record number seen in 2013.
The report also highlights the fact around 50 percent of workers who arrived in 2009 had left by 2014. This is clear evidence that not all immigration into Switzerland from the EU is long-term, Seco said.
The agency also noted that forecasts for further economic growth in Switzerland were unlikely to lead to the arrival of more EU/EFTA workers because of the improving economic situation in the EU.
Read also: This is how much people earn in Switzerland
In its report, Seco also highlighted that the arrival of EU and EFTA workers had not pushed up unemployment among Swiss-based workers.
It had also done little to push down the wages of Swiss-based workers, according to Seco.
Switzerland experienced real wage growth of 0.7 percent a year from 2002 to 2017, the agency said. Nominal wage growth had been lower from 2009 to 2017 than in the years before the economic crisis but this had been offset by negative inflation.
The report showed that the unemployment rate among EU and EFTA workers in Switzerland was a relatively high 5.5 percent in 2017 against the overall Swiss rate of 3.3 percent last year.
But the Seco figures also show just 2 percent of EU and EFTA citizens in Switzerland were receiving other forms of social assistance, against the Swiss rate of 3.2 percent.
Highly-qualified workers
The Seco report talks about a highly-skilled workforce from EU and EFTA nations, noting that 54 percent of workers arriving in Switzerland from these countries have some form of higher education. By contrast, 17 percent of these arrivals have not completed upper-secondary level education.
The authors of the report also highlighted that most of the highly-skilled workers arriving in Switzerland were carrying out occupations in line with their qualifications.
This put paid to fears that foreign workers would work for lower wages than Swiss-based employees in positions that they were overqualified for, said the head of the Swiss Employers’ Association in comments cited by Swiss news agency SDA.
Lack of focus on cross-border workers
Unions did not contest the overall findings of the Seco report but argued it failed to properly taken into account the role of cross-border workers and foreign firms that provide services in Switzerland.
The Swiss Federation of Trade Unions (SGB) also pointed to the fact that around 120,000 self-employed foreign workers and employees on overseas postings carried out work in Switzerland every year. In many of these cases, workers were undercutting Swiss wages, said SGB chief economist Daniel Lampart.
Lampart pointed out that Switzerland has the highest wages in Europe and measures were needed to protect these salaries. He noted that one in five investigations into possible wage undercutting by foreign firms and workers in Switzerland in 2017 had revealed breaches.
Protecting Swiss wages
Switzerland has a range of measures designed to protect against foreign workers competing unfairly in the local job market by working for lower wages than their Swiss counterparts.
These special measures are a sticking point in current negotiations between Bern and Brussels over a new framework agreement on future bilateral relations.
For the EU, guaranteeing the freedom of movement of workers is considered essential for access to the Single European Market.
Bern now finds itself torn between trying to ensure high Swiss wages are protected through special measures and ensuring it can continue to access the European market.

In a latest version of a proposed framework agreement deal between Switzerland and the EU, the Swiss foreign affairs ministry is reported to be considering concessions over the so-called eight-day rule, including shortening this duration.
The eight-day rule requires foreign companies to inform Swiss authorities at least eight days before they carry out work in Switzerland so that the Swiss can ensure firms are not bringing in cheaper labour to undercut high wages in the Alpine country.
Unions say they are being sold down the river by Bern, arguing the Swiss government knows Brussels will never accept Switzerland's current regime of checks on foreign workers.
New rules for foreign workers
On July 1st, Switzerland introduced new rules designed to protect Swiss-based workers in occupations with high unemployment. Under the regulations, vacant positions for these jobs must first be advertised exclusively through a jobs portal that is only available to registered job seekers.
These new rules are part of watered-down reforms passed by the Swiss parliament in 2016 after the Swiss in 2014 voted in favour of a popular initiative calling for annual quotas on the number of residence permits handed out to foreign nationals."
