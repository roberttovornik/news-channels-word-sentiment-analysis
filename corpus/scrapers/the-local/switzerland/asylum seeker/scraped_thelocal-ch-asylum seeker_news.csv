					09:51 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Asylum seekers to be allocated to cantons using artificial intelligence,"The government is to launch a pilot project that uses artificial intelligence to decide where to place asylum seekers to improve their chances of finding a job.
From September 1,000 people who have lodged an asylum application will be allocated to different cantons using a computer algorithm developed by researchers at the ETH Zurich and Stanford University in the United States, SRF television’s 10vor10 news programme reported.
Instead of distributing applicants randomly, as at present, the authorities will be able to place them in the cantons where they have the best chances of employment.
At present only 15 percent of asylum seekers have managed to find a job after three years, according to SRF.
It is hoped that using the computer programme the number finding work after three years will increase to 30 percent.
The algorithm calculates the right canton for the individual applicant on the basis of a number of factors including their age, country of origin, language and gender.
It decides which local area provides the best fit, taking into account the language spoken and the presence of ethnic minority networks.
This could mean placing a French speaker in western Switzerland where they can communicate rather than in a German-speaking canton where they cannot.
At the same time legal guidelines stipulating that different nationalities be distributed evenly among the cantons will continue to apply.
Daniel Bach, a spokesman for the State Secretariat for Migration, said the algorithm would take these regulations into account when it made its recommendations.
It could mean, for instance, that young Syrians are more likely to be allocated to rural cantons where agricultural work is available whereas older Syrians would be sent to cantons offering employment in the services sector, the newspaper 20 Minuten reported.
According to Professor Dominik Hangartner, the idea behind the algorithm is to find solutions that improve the asylum process and the level of applicants’ integration, a news release on the ETH website said.
“At the end of the day it eases the burden on government, cantons and communes if migrants can find work,” he said.
Hangartner said other countries were also interested in using the technology.
Only those asylum seekers considered to have the best chances of remaining in Switzerland will be included in the project."

In the coming months, Swiss migration authorities are set to announce which services will be outsourced as part of sweeping changes to the country's asylum system. Those contracts are expected to worth a total in the hundreds of millions.
Among the reforms is access to free legal advice for asylum seekers, and it is this service that PWC has now said it may bid for.
The contract is thought to be worth 25–35 million francs a year.
The new reforms to the Swiss asylum system are designed to speed up the asylum process by guaranteeing faster deportation for people whose applications are rejected and more rapid integration into the job market for those given permission to stay.
To carry out these tasks the Swiss government has spent around 550 to 600 million francs on building and renovating 20 dedicated reception and processing centres.
Annual running costs are expected to be 150 to 200 million francs with many services going to external suppliers.

Around 20,000 asylum seekers arrived in Switzerland without passports or other official identity documents in 2016. This makes the task of verifying their identity or country of origin difficult.
The SVP believes accessing the mobile phones, tablets and laptops could aid in this process and it has now won the backing of a lower house parliamentary committee which supported the move with 17 votes in favour and seven against.
“I am relieved. Anyone who is being followed, and is risking life and limb has no legitimate reason not to reveal their identity to the state that is offering them asylum,” said SVP national councillor Gregor Rutz, who initially put forward the proposal.
Explaining how the measure could work, Rutz told Swiss tabloid Blick that anyone who claimed they were Somalian but made a lot of calls to the Ivory Coast was giving probably giving up information about their real origin.
Rutz told Blick that anyone who refused to comply with the measure would be sent home. “With this new possibility we are sending out a clear signal that we don't accept fake asylum seekers. Then fewer people will come here because Switzerland is less attractive,” said the politician.
But Greens national councillor Sibel Arslan was quick to slam the measure, saying it would be an intrusion into the private life of those concerned. She described it as “legally dubious” and “disproportionate.”
Arslan said it was unclear what would be done with any data obtained and who would have access to this. She also noted there was a danger this was the start of a slippery slope with the practice being used for other purposes.
The national councillor went on to note that people who really wanted to hide their identity could use apps where data was deleted instantly or change their SIM cards over. “The proposal is a fake populist solution,” she said.
The SVP proposal is still some way from seeing final approval. It must now be looked at by an upper house committee before a possible vote in the Swiss parliament at a later stage."

In the motion presented on Wednesday, SVP MP Andrea Geissbühler called for the Swiss government to begin talks with Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki aimed at facilitating the return of Eritreans to the Horn of Africa country. She cited a recent peace agreement between Eritrea and neighbouring Ethiopia as evidence the situation had improved in the region.
Currently, there is no bilateral agreement between Switzerland and Eritrea on the return of people to the African nation.
But Swiss Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga stated the Eritrean government had proved unwilling to negotiate on the return of people despite frequent attempts by Switzerland to build relationships and establish a diplomatic presence in the country, according to comments cited by Swiss state broadcaster SRF.
The senate on Wednesday also rejected a motion by a Geneva citizen's group calling for the Swiss government to relax the policy towards Eritreans living in Switzerland on a temporary basis.
However, the senate did end up accepting a motion from Liberals MP Damien Müller calling for Swiss authorities to push ahead as fast as possible of a planned full review of Eritreans living in Switzerland after seeing their bid for asylum turned down.
In comments made to Swiss tabloid Blick, Müller said the State Secretariat of Migration (SEM) was “doing good work” but that the agency needed to “hit the accelerator” to ensure the politicians did not lose their credibility in the eyes of the public.
In April, the SEM said it would conduct a full review of the around 3,400 Eritreans living as temporarily admitted persons in Switzerland following the recent court rulings regarding their status.
A recent pilot review of 250 cases found that around 20 Eritreans could be made to leave Switzerland, a decision criticised by rights group who argue the situation in Eritrea has not improved."

					10:27 CET+01:00				", The Local,Report: asylum seekers in Switzerland are too restricted,"Certain measures limiting the freedom of movement of asylum seekers in Switzerland are too restrictive and violate their fundamental rights, according to a new report.
Undertaken by the University of Zurich but commissioned by the Federal Commission against Racism (EKR), the report analyzed the legalities of limiting the freedom of movement of asylum seekers and found that it can only be done if it respects their fundamental rights.
Fundamental rights as laid out in the Swiss constitution “are conceived as human rights; they protect all human beings, and therefore asylum seekers, however precarious their right to stay in Switzerland,” said the report.
Measures restricting movement can only be applied to individuals who threaten security or public order, the EKR said in a statement .
Any such measures “should have a legal basis, be justified by public interest or serve to protect the fundamental rights of others,” it said.
Crucially, restrictions must also be proportionate.
As a result of the report, the EKR has laid out certain recommendations for federal, cantonal and communal authorities to follow, particularly specifying that an individual asylum seeker should only be subjected to a restriction on his movements if he poses “a concrete threat of a certain strength to security or public order”.
The report criticized current policy in federal-run centres for asylum seekers which fixes certain hours during which residents may leave the premises, a measure that, although it has a legal basis, is not proportional, it said.
“It serves to keep the centre running smoothly and helps the effective implementation of asylum procedures... but it goes beyond what is necessary,” it said.
What's more, imposing restrictions en masse that dictate where asylum seekers may or may not go when out in public “has no legal basis” and is not in the public interest, said the report.
The act of telling or showing an asylum seeker that he is not welcome in a certain public area, such as a park, can also be a violation of his fundamental rights, it added.
“Subjective feelings of insecurity and fear are not sufficient to limit the freedom of movement of asylum seekers,” it said.
“The public debate surrounding asylum seekers is too often used politically and to consolidate prejudices and negative stereotypes. ... Fundamental rights must remain at the heart of the country's asylum policy,” the EKR concluded.
In another report last week, human rights group Amnesty International also criticized Switzerland for its restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers."

The statement comes in the wake of a case of a Nigerian man who applied for asylum in Switzerland in 2016.
During a hearing into his application, the man who had no valid identity papers said he was being persecuted in his home country. However, he made contradictory statements about his background.
When his claims were investigated it emerged the man had not travelled to Switzerland from Nigeria but from Spain. Photos posted by his wife on Facebook showed that he had been living in Mallorca under a different name and had owned a business on the Spanish island.
Immigration authorities rejected the man's asylum claim and an appeal based on the fact the SEM had used Facebook posts as evidence was rejected.

""I really don't understand why this wasn't good enough,"" Arno Buergi says, furrowing his brow. Only two of the 12 male asylum seekers brought to this northwestern village last Friday are still staying at the makeshift centre. The others left shortly after they were ushered down the hard concrete driveway into the underground military shelter, heading to the train station in the nearby town of Solothurn in protest at living conditions they described as ""unworthy of a human being"". ""There's no air, no windows and 30 people sleeping together . . . that's not the way it should be,"" Turkish Kurd Abdullah Ochalan complained to public Swiss radio RTS before the protesters were cleared out of the train station early Tuesday. The protest made international headlines, especially as it came just days after revelations that another Swiss town was restricting access to some public spaces for asylum seekers. The men's quarters of the Kestenholz centre are cramped and the air is stuffy, but the living room, kitchen and bathroom are spacious and well-equipped. ""I think the accommodation is good,"" says Buergi, who took over as mayor just a week before the scandal broke. Walking around the shelter in a tee shirt, shorts and flipflops, he rests a hand on the flat-screen TV and nods towards the fussball table in the next room. ""The shelter is OK.,"" agrees Claudia Haenzi, the head of social affairs in the canton of Solothurn. ""It's completely new and renovated, so it's possible to live there."" The shelter, she says, is only a temporary solution while the village and canton search for more suitable housing. Human rights activists warn though that Switzerland, which in recent years has faced a spike in refugee numbers, is increasingly using its multitude of military shelters to house asylum seekers for ever longer periods. Denise Graf of Amnesty International's Swiss section says she knows of asylum seekers who were holed up for nine months in such shelters, which ""stink, there's no air, no light, and its always noisy."" But in the idyllic town of Solothurn, many people were outraged by the protest of the asylum seekers -- from Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey -- and Haenzi says police ended the demonstration because they feared the men would be attacked. ""Our system is the only one I know of where people are given an apartment, food and even money if they choose to go back home,"" says 50-year-old Maria Lutherbacher. ""Switzerland does too much already,"" she says. ""They shouldn't complain."" Fabio Jeger, also 50 and who heads a logistics company, agrees. ""I did my Swiss military service for several years, and lived in such buildings,"" he says. ""It's not a first class hotel, but you can live there."" The asylum seekers should be grateful for what they are given in Switzerland, he says, pointing out that ""it's surely better than the situation that they have at home"". Others though lament the lack of compassion. ""I think many are too quick to pass a harsh judgement on these people, who most often are really refugees,"" says 58-year-old Solothurn local Brigitta Huegin. ""Lots of people here say that if they're not happy they can just go back to where they came from, but often that is just not possible."" Matthias Schneeberger, 36, who is waiting for a train home to Bern at the end of his workday in Solothurn, meanwhile, says he understands that people might get upset at the protest. But it is wrong to compare housing conditions in the countries asylum seekers come from and the lodgings they are offered in Switzerland, which has been spared war and hardship for centuries, he insists. ""When you come here and see all of the wonderful infrastructure we have here,"" he says, ""it must be difficult to be asked to live (underground)."""

Over two thirds of the 100 residents at the Büren an der Aare centre have signed up for In Limbo, a voluntary scheme offering training in certain practical skills, such as repairing bicycles, doing laundry, growing vegetables or learning about beekeeping.
Volunteers may work on projects at the asylum centre itself – for example, cooking for residents, running a kiosk or doing the laundry – or in external businesses, such as a carpentry, garden centre or builder's yard.
The aim of the scheme is to give asylum seekers something useful to do while they await a decision on their asylum application, help them learn the local language and equip them with skills they could then use to find a job in Switzerland, if they are granted the right to stay, or to earn a living back in their home country if they return.
Those that take part in the programme will be given a certificate attesting to their new skills, which they can later use to help them find a job.
Participants also receive a small daily stipend for their work.
On a visit to the centre on Monday, justice minister Simonetta Sommaruga hailed the scheme as “very interesting and important”.
“Integration is a good thing both for the asylum seekers and for our country,"" she told news agency ATS.
""If they stay here... if they straight away start to learn our language and our way of life, afterwards it will be quicker for them to integrate in the world of work”."

Though the defendant denied the charges, the court found his testimony to be inconsistent and sometimes incoherent, said ATS.
In contrast the court found the Iraqi to be a credible witness, acknowledging that it was not easy – either linguistically or culturally – for him to speak about fellatio and homosexuality.
According to ATS it wasn't the Iraqi who reported the policeman's actions but a third person, a witness in another case that involved the plaintiff.
The Iraqi told a hearing on February 23rd that he had tried to forget about what had happened, because it upset him to talk about it.
In response to the charges, the ex-policeman said the asylum seeker had promised him information about drug trafficking and wanted to take revenge after realizing that he wouldn't get any help in return.

Centre-left politicians and human rights groups say such a ban is not lawful and cannot be enforced. The provisional centre – a former military barracks – is the first to open since Swiss voters approached tougher asylum laws in June. It will house up to 150 asylum seekers over a three-year period. The first 23 people moved in on Monday. The first group was made up of men, women and two children from Eritrea, Tibet, Sri Lanka and Sudan, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported. The Federal Office of Migration said the ban on asylum applicants entering certain areas of the town had been agreed with the Bremgarten authorities. The Tages-Anzeiger reported that it had now revised its earlier announcement and was saying that there was no formal ban.
It quoted Urs von Däniken of the Migration Office as saying instead that there were “sensitive zones, which asylum seekers should not enter”. “These zones were defined in the interests of a good co-existence between the population and asylum seekers,” von Däniken said. Apart from schools and swimming pools these include old people’s homes and homes for the disabled. “If someone goes to the pool and nothing happens they won’t face any sanctions,” the Migration Office official said, quoted by the paper. “But if an asylum seeker behaves badly or poses a threat to public order he can be served a ban on going out or entering certain areas.” Human rights group Augenauf condemned the move saying the Migration Office was calculating that the centre residents would not enter the areas defined out of fear of the consequences."

“At the train station in Aarau an asylum seeker and another unknown person harassed two young women and kissed one of the victims on the cheek,” the spokesperson said.
The man was fined 900 francs at the beginning of March after one of the young women made a formal complaint to police, she added. When he was unable to pay the fine, the asylum seeker was sentenced to nine days in prison.
The incident came to light after local officials requested information on the number of times police had been called in to deal with problems involving people using asylum seeker accommodation at a facility near the Aarau cantonal hospital. Police gave the number of incidents as 44.
The large upturn in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Europe has proved politically divisive in Switzerland but Swiss voters recently voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new initiative designed to speed up the country's asylum processes.
The conservative Swiss People's Party had said that speeding up the asylum process would make the country more attractive to “fake refugees” and migrants drawn by financial aid and free legal help.
But backers of the new reform said that argument didn't hold weight at a time when the number of asylum requests was actually falling.
The issue of asylum seekers and sexual abuse received global attention after the New Year's Eve mass sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany.

According to the Schweiz Am Sonntag newspaper, Eritreans also make more requests than any other nationality to bring over relatives under the family reunification programme. ""Identity papers or birth certificates must be considered as suspect"" when presented by people seeking residence under the family reunification programme, said Iris Rivas, head of migration services in the canton of Bern. She told the newspaper that in many home countries of asylum seekers, official papers are easy to forge and their embassies in Switzerland verify only whether the surnames given match those of the petitioners. The call for DNA testing is also supported by the canton of Lucerne's migration chief Alexander Lieb. ""Identity control in the case of family reunification is too lax,"" he said. Swiss law currently allows case-by-case requests for DNA tests when there is serious doubt that a claimant belongs to the same family. Switzerland is among the European countries that welcomes the most asylum seekers in proportion to its population, and numbers have soared in recent years, in part due to the Arab Spring uprisings. The country has faced a barrage of criticism over its treatment of asylum seekers, including segregation and poor living conditions. A fierce row broke out in early August amid reports that a small town was allowed to deny residents of a new asylum centre access to public facilities such as the swimming pool. Authorities maintain that this was a misunderstanding. Currently fewer than 20 percent of petitioners are granted asylum in Switzerland in a process that can take several years."

					11:54 CET+01:00				",Malcolm Curtis,Bern braces for influx of asylum seekers,"Swiss authorities are bracing for an increase in asylum seekers this year beyond what the federal government has budgeted for, according to a report from SRF, the German-language public broadcaster.
Last year the government budgeted for 23,000 asylum applications for 2013 but that figure is forecast to hit 30,000. Karl Schwaar told SRF that costs to deal with political refugees are expected to rise to 1.43 billion francs, 100 million francs more than has been budgeted through a three-year plan. That spending level would be the highest since 1999, marking an increase of half a billion francs in five years. The federal government will be forced to seek a supplementary credit in the autumn just to deal with extra expenditures for this year, the result of increased asylum applications. The government did not specifically pinpoint the cause of the increase, occurring despite tightened immigration regulations. But the UN Refugee Agency, based in Geneva, last week identified one potential source — refugees from the conflict in Syria. The number of Syrian refugees registered in neighbouring countries and North Africa jumped by 100,000 to 600,000 in the past month, the UNHCR said. That number is expected to rise to 1.1 million by next June if the war in Syria continues, the agency said. Meanwhile, the conflict in Mali has caused nearly 150,000 people to flee the country, the UNHCR said on Tuesday. The UN Security Council has unanimously supported France’s military intervention in the African country to fight Islamist rebels. France intervened on Friday over concerns that rebels would take over the country’s capital, Bamako, and destabilize the region."

“Deprivation of liberty is far from trivial. This is a serious violation of human rights,” the president of the Commission Against Racism, Martine Brunschwig Graf told newspaper Tribune de Genève in an interview.
Graf, a Liberal party member of parliament, pointed out that Switzerland already has the means for dealing with people who have broken the law or who refuse to return home. In particular, she pointed to the possibility in most cases of forcible returns.
However Graf acknowledged that there remains an issue for citizens of certain countries with whom Switzerland has no re-admission agreements in place. Nevertheless, she queried what would happen to these people should the internment idea succeed.
“Will we leave them locked up indefinitely with no prospect of getting out as it is impossible to return them? These people have not killed anyone!” she asked.
Graf believes that the issues are becoming further complicated by the political rhetoric used, particularly because the government is often seen as failing to deliver on its promises with regard to immigration. This in turn leads to disappointment and discontent, according to Graf.
She also said she could understand that people who had been in the country for four to five years would want to stay.
“This does not make them criminals,” she said.

The government envisages a strict separation of underage and adult asylum seekers. Minors will as far as possible be housed in groups.
In Switzerland the cantons are currently responsible for housing and taking care of unaccompanied teenage asylum seekers. Refugee groups have criticized the government over the lack of national coordination.
Many of the minors come from war zones and are traumatized.
According to government figures, just under 2,000 minors claimed asylum in Switzerland in 2016, just over seven percent of the total number of applications.
The latest figures from the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) show that 1,588 people sought asylum in Switzerland in January.
That is 10 percent fewer requests than were made in December and half as many as in the same month last year.
In addition 994 asylum seekers came to Switzerland by the end of January in the framework of a UNHCR resettlement programme, with a further 418 arriving as part of a European Union relocation scheme.
The SEM said the downturn in asylum applications could be put down to the closure of the Balkan route in March 2016.

Between January and June, 11,205 people filed asylum claims, mostly from Tunisia, Nigeria and Eritrea, the Swiss federal migration office said. Over the past three decades, Swiss voters have regularly backed tougher asylum laws, most recently in a plebiscite in June that removed desertion from the military as grounds for receiving a safe haven. The populist Swiss People's Party -- the largest single force in parliament -- has proven particularly skillful at leading the debate on the asylum issue. It pushes a message that Switzerland is a magnet for bogus asylum-seekers who are really seeking a better life in the wealthy nation. Critics on the left of the political spectrum reject that and say the country's rules efficiently filter out undeserving cases. It can take years to process an asylum claim, and less than 12 percent of those whose cases were handled in 2012 were granted a haven. The migration office said the 30.6 percent decrease in the number of asylum seekers in the first half of this year compared with the same period of 2012 was ""unusual"", notably because the rate of decline picked up pace with each passing month. The spring months normally see a rise in numbers, the office said, adding that claims across Europe have risen by 10 percent over the same period. But it is still too early to describe the fall in numbers in Switzerland as a trend, the office cautioned. It also made no comment on whether Switzerland's change of stance on military deserters may have led asylum-seekers to turn elsewhere for fear of having their claims rejected. Desertion has been the grounds for asylum most frequently cited by Eritreans, whose homeland imposes unlimited military service, with low wages, on all able-bodied men and women. Some 48,000 people are currently in the process of seeking asylum in Switzerland, including the 28,631 who arrived in 2012, a 10-year record.

More people requested asylum in the second quarter than the first, with June registering a bumper 3,805 applications.
The SEM said the increase in the second quarter was mainly down to the higher number of Eritreans arriving from southern Italy.
Weather conditions also played a role, with more people migrating in the summer months.
But it pointed out that the increase was modest in European terms. The Swiss share of asylum requests lodged in Europe had more than halved since 2012.

The regulation - which also only allows asylum seekers access on two days each week - had in fact been in effect for three weeks before Hagmann's visit. The municipality stated the reason as ""the size of the pool and the very limited space available"".

A controversial revision, which was ordered as an emergency measure by the government and went into effect last October, marked the seventh change of the asylum law in Switzerland — Europe's fourth most popular destination for refugees. The vote on June 9th — one of four Sundays this year set aside for popular votes on national, cantonal and communal issues — comes after a range of opponents of the revision collected the 100,000 signatures required to call a referendum. Also on Sunday, the Swiss will be called to vote on whether the people should elect the country's seven government members directly instead of having parliament pick them, as it has been doing for the past 165 years. According to recent polls though, that initiative appears set to fail. Opponents of the new asylum law revisions, including human rights advocates, religious groups and unions who have banned together a collective called ""Coordination against Exclusion and Xenophobia"", also appear destined to fall short in their bid to overturn the changes. Surveys show the Swiss are increasingly leaning towards giving their stamp of approval to the changes, as some balk at soaring numbers of refugees flocking to the country, which offers generous hand-outs throughout the asylum process. A poll by public broadcaster RTS in late May showed that 57 percent of those questioned were in favour of the revisions, up nine percentage points from a month earlier. There are currently some 48,000 people in the process of seeking asylum to Switzerland, including a full 28,631 who arrived in 2012 — the highest number in a decade. Only 11.7 percent of asylum applications were meanwhile granted last year, when most asylum seekers to the country came from Eritrea, Nigeria, Tunisia, Serbia and Afghanistan. Counting one asylum seeker for every 332 inhabitants, Switzerland ranks as the fourth most popular host country in Europe, trailing only Malta, Sweden and Luxembourg, and ranking far above the European average of one asylum seeker for every 625 inhabitants. Among the most controversial changes to the Swiss asylum law last year, was the decision to remove persecution due to military desertion as legal grounds for seeking asylum in Switzerland — a motive mainly used by Eritreans. The revision also removed the possibility, which had been unique in Europe, to apply for asylum in Switzerland from Swiss embassies around the world. That revision was harshly criticized by the Swiss Bishops Conference, which stressed recently it would force people ""to pay intermediaries and to embark upon high-risk trips"" to make their way to Switzerland. The bishops also said the revisions would mean people in real need of assistance would be rejected. ""Behind every statistic there hides the destiny of men and women,"" it said in a recent statement, insisting that ""no one leaves their country of their own free will without knowing what the future in another country or continent has in store"". Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga, who is in charge of the brief, however insists the changes were for the best of the asylum seekers themselves. She especially highlighted the speeding-up of the application process aimed to bring handling times down from several years to several months by removing the possibility of multiple appeals. ""Leaving people and their families for so long wallowing in uncertainty is unacceptable,"" she said recently, insisting that ""processes that drag on and the asylum-seeker tag blocks rapid integration"". The rejigged asylum law also clears the way for the creation of special centres for asylum seekers considered to be trouble-makers and limits the right to family reunification to spouses and children. As for the second issue to be voted on Sunday, it was proposed by Switzerland's largest party, the populist Swiss People's Party (SVP), which insists that allowing the electorate to choose its leaders directly would strengthen the government's legitimacy. All the other political parties have however come out against the initiative, maintaining it would weaken parliament, and a recent poll showed only 25-percent support for the shift among voters."

The Council of States, also known as Switzerland’s upper house, wants to stop asylum seekers being able to use desertion as a ground upon which to claim asylum, newspaper Tribune de Genève reported.
Some two thirds of asylum seekers from Eritrea now use their desertion as the basis for the asylum applications. The introduction of desertion as a valid ground for claiming asylum in 2005 led to a dramatic increase in applications.
Number rose from 200 in 2005, to more than 1,000 in 2006. In 2011 more than 3,000 applications were registered and the first quarter of 2012 has already exceeded the figures for the first quarter of last year by some 41 percent.
It is hoped that removing desertion as a ground for asylum will dramatically reduce the number of entrants to Switzerland, but critics say it will make little difference as Eritreans will still be able to claim at least temporary asylum for other reasons due to the continuing war with Ethiopia.
Swiss People’s Party representative, Heinz Brand, is optimistic that the move will yield results.
“The decline in Eritrean applicants will not happen overnight. But it will come because of the change in conditions,” he told the newspaper.
“Social welfare will decrease and family reunification will not be allowed.”
But Michael Glauser from the Office for Migration sees the problem differently.
“Already today we do not give asylum solely on the grounds of desertion,” he said.
Glauser thinks that this group will continue being granted asylum because the applicants risk their lives if they are sent home again.
Part of the drive to reduce numbers of Eritreans entering Switzerland is because of their poor integration into Swiss society. But some point to the experience of many Tamils saying they show that people who were at first poorly integrated can flourish and contribute to society."

According to figures from the Swiss federal migration office (SEM), 8,315 asylum requests were filed in the first quarter of 2016, 45 percent fewer than in the last quarter of 2015.
March saw 1,992 asylum applications, down almost 25 percent on February, said the SEM.
Nevertheless, the number of asylum seekers coming to Switzerland so far in 2016 was still far more than the same period last year, said the SEM.
“The migration context is still very volatile and therefore unpredictable,” it said in a statement.
While making reliable predictions for 2016 was “impossible”, the SEM said it could envisage the number of asylum seekers to Switzerland rising again during the course of the year.
In March the SEM dealt with the applications of 2,702 asylum seekers, of whom 875 were rejected in accordance with the Dublin regulation, 609 were granted asylum and 559 were given provisional admission to Switzerland. A further 363 applications remain on hold.
The same month, 847 migrants left Switzerland or were repatriated, said SEM.
Switzerland asked other states to take charge of 1,532 asylum seekers under Dublin rules, and 489 were sent to the countries in question.
In return Switzerland received 257 requests from other countries and accepted 48 migrants in this way.
Under EU migration rules – to which Switzerland also adheres – the Dublin regulation establishes the member state responsible for the examination of an asylum application based on, among other things, the route by which they arrived in the EU.
According to daily Le Matin, cantonal police authorities are set to agree a set of measures on Thursday to deal with a sudden rise in asylum seekers.
The measures, which aim to coordinate the tasks and emergency response of cantonal and communal authorities, will come in force should Switzerland receive 6,000 requests in a three-week period.
Although Switzerland has seen a sharp rise in asylum seekers over the past couple of years, the figures aren't nearly as high as in other European countries affected by the migrant crisis.
Last year Switzerland received 39,523 asylum requests in 2015, up from 23,765 the previous year, according to figures released in January.
Close to 1.4 million asylum requests were made across Europe as a whole in 2015, almost double the number as in 2014."

In a raft of changes, persecuted individuals may no longer seek refuge at Swiss embassies, and aid is to be cut drastically to refugees once they arrive in Switzerland.
Under the proposals, refugees are to be given ""emergency aid"": a bed for the night and between eight and 12 francs ($8.4-$12.5/6.7-10 euros) and a day.
This represents half the current allowance.
Further proposals voted on in the parliamentary lower chamber will also make it much more difficult for refugees to bring anyone but their spouses and children to Switzerland.
If the upper chamber gives this proposal the green light, parents of asylum seekers will not be admitted to Switzerland, unless a specific set of criteria is fulfilled.
These include a requirement for refugees to provide adequate housing and sufficient means to support extended family.
In addition, refugees will now have to wait 10 years before they receive their residency permit, doubling the existing five-year wait. At present the number of people seeing asylum in Switzerland is estimated at 40,000.
Left-wing groups expressed concern at the measures, particularly the removal of family refugee status, claiming it would make the process of integration even harder for those arriving on Swiss soil.
Voting on the measures follows a spike in the number of people seeking refuge in Switzerland in the first three months of the year, up 63 percent from a year ago, according to the Federal Migration Office.
For May, the FMO reported 2,331 requests for asylum, four percent down on April.
Eritreans made the biggest number of requests with 437 applications, 86 more than in April, followed by Tunisians (195, down 23 percent) and Nigerians (193, down 21 percent)."

The Kurdish youth activist, whose name was not given, had his asylum application rejected in 2011 since Switzerland's Federal Office for Migration (BFM) deemed he would not be in danger if he returned to Turkey, the ATS news agency reported. The man, a member of the now-banned Kurdish nationalist Democratic Society Party, had claimed he had been repeatedly threatened and beaten by police and that intelligence officers had once detained and tortured him for two days, including using electroshock and beating the soles of his feet. The migration office however concluded that Turkey had significantly improved its human rights record as part of its bid to join the European Union and that the Kurdish activist's story was not credible. It pointed out that the man had not filed a complaint or tried to make the abuse public, and also to the absence of a medical record detailing his injuries as an indication he had not been mistreated, ATS reported. The Kurd appealed the case to Switzerland's Federal Administrative Court, which ruled Friday that although Turkey had undoubtedly made significant progress since 2001, the human rights situation there remained ""problematic,"" ATS said. It could not be ruled out that the Kurd had suffered abuse and torture, or that he risked spending years in prison for his political activism if he returned to Turkey, the court said, ordering the BFM to grant him asylum. The court reportedly said vague legislation meant Turkish authorities could in some cases prosecute people merely practising their freedom of expression or taking part in legal political activities under the country's anti-terror laws. The ruling came amid international criticism of rights abuses connected with nationwide anti-government protests that have left three dead and thousands injured since the demonstrations began late last month. The Swiss court's decision also comes two days before a popular vote on whether to approve an emergency tightening of Switzerland's asylum law, as the country grapples with how to deal with an influx of refugees. Counting one asylum seeker for every 332 inhabitants, Switzerland ranks as the fourth most popular host country in Europe, trailing only Malta, Sweden and Luxembourg."

“In addition to beds, a cafeteria, a sports complex and training opportunities should be available in the villages,"" Christian Democratic Party councillor, Alexandra Abbt, told online news website 20 Minutes.
The proposals include the introduction of a bonus system, where bonus points would be awarded to migrants who behave well and cooperate with the authorities.
“This reduces the motivation of asylum seekers to move outside the village and the potential for conflict with the population,” Abbot said.
But the far-right Swiss People’s Party thinks that such a system would create the wrong incentives for would-be asylum seekers, as it could make asylum in Switzerland even more attractive.
Others consider the plans for the villages to be similar to a kind of apartheid.

The law -- dubbed Lex Brunner after its instigator, far-right SVP leader Toni Brunner -- was introduced in January last year to prevent asylum seekers from abusing the system and getting around rejections of their asylum applications by marrying Swiss nationals.
The problem with the new law is that it may infringe the human right to marry under the European Convention on Human Rights, newspaper Tages Anzeiger reported on Wednesday.
As a result of this discrepancy, certain cantons have started granting illegal immigrants the right to marry Swiss citizens.
In Bern and Vaud, for example, illegal immigrants with criminal records have been given the green light to wed in direct contravention of the law.
But a recent case in Zurich may lead to the re-establishment of the marriage rules.
In 2008, a young man entered the country illegally. His application for asylum was rejected and he was given until August 2010 to leave the country.
He failed to do so and recently requested permission to marry a Swiss woman.
His request was turned down and he appealed to the Department of Justice, which supported his appeal in part and instructed the registry office to review the pair’s application.
However, in order to prevent the law being set aside as it has been in the other cantons, the Federal Office of Justice has submitted the case to the cantonal administrative court.
This court has no discretion in its interpretation of the rules, which will mean that if the foreign fiancé is unable to present evidence of his legal residency in Switzerland, he will be refused permission to marry."

The asylum committee chairman said talks would take place with the other communes in the canton over the housing of asylum seekers. The rental agreement with the hotel had now been cancelled.

The canton had planned to transform the empty Löwen hotel into a centre capable of accommodating 60 asylum seekers in the village.
But on Tuesday the Uri government announced a u-turn, saying in a statement that for the moment the canton had enough places to meet the needs of its asylum seekers, since it had been assigned fewer than previously forecast.
The plan had incensed the population of Seelisberg – a village near the historic Rütli meadow where Switzerland is thought to have been founded – who felt it should not have been presented as a fait accompli, reported news agencies.
It also objected to the number of refugees planned for the centre, saying 60 was too many in a commune of just 700 people.
Feelings ran high at a public meeting in early August, attended by more than half the village, which ended early after many people walked out in protest at the plans.
During the meeting insults were thrown at Uri social affairs minister Barbara Bär.
She later made a complaint to police after it was suggested her husband was connected to an estate agency involved in the plan, reported news agencies.
The president of the commune Karl Huser-Huong said it was the manner in which the plan was presented that riled the village, reported Le Temps on Tuesday.
“We are ready to take on our responsibilities and welcome refugees. But not in these conditions. We were given a fait accompli. The canton should negotiate with the population,” he said.
The situation shows the difficulty some cantons have in meeting their obligations, conferred by the federal government, to house a share of the country's refugees.
The Swiss government allocates asylum seekers to cantons according to population size. As such, Uri is obliged to accommodate 0.5 percent, one of the lowest figures in the country.
The canton of Zurich must take 17 percent, while Bern is allocated 13.5 percent and Geneva 5.6 percent.
Some communes have been fined after they refused to house their share, including Obwerwil-Lieli in the canton of Aargau, which paid 290,000 francs instead of taking nine refugees.
The decision divided the community, which last month revised its stance and agreed to take five refugees, said Le Temps.
In its statement on Tuesday, the Uri government said it now wanted to “restore confidence” among the Seelisberg villagers and will call a round table with an external mediator to deal with the issue.
The aim is to develop “constructive discussions” to find a solution by “common consent” to the question of housing for asylum seekers should their numbers rise, it said."

In a video released as part of the campaign, SVP federal cabinet minister Ueli Maurer MP and party strongman Christoph Blocher are depicted as Somalian refugees sitting outside a shabby mobile home. They are seated on either side of a pot where horns in a bubbling soup appear to be the remains of the SVP’s famous mascot, a goat named Zottel. Maurer tells Blocher not to look so sullen. “Me, I’m also hungry,” Blocher replies. “But even so, we are not going to eat our mascot!” SVP politicians are being singled out for their support of laws that make life for asylum seekers more difficult. “After their rebirth as Somalians, certain people would be happy to find themselves previously opposed to toughening of asylum laws,” a voice-over says at the end of the video. Following recent legislation passed by parliament for tougher legislation, the SVP last week called for further action to ensure that asylum seekers are placed in closed internment camps. The video and various posters are part of a “that’s enough” campaign calling for a “just and humane” approach to asylum in the country. By humorously depicting politicians known for their positions in favour of tougher asylum policies in the position of migrants seeking asylum, Amnesty said in a news release on Monday that it hoped to “awaken a sentiment of solidarity and understanding for asylum seekers”.

Walter Wobmann, Swiss People’s Party (SVP) MP from Solothurn, is demanding that Muslim asylum seekers from Iraq and Syria be denied entry into Switzerland, according to an online report from Blick. Wobmann believes that it is only a matter of time before the Swiss will be faced with an attack from Muslim extremists, although his views have been sharply criticized by other politicians. This position is “unacceptable”, said Carlo Sommaruga, federal MP from Geneva and a member of the socialist party. “It’s discriminatory, resolves nothing and contributes to an atmosphere of hate and witch hunting,” Martine Brunschwig Graf, head of the federal commission against racism, is quoted as saying by the Tribune de Genève. Brunschwig Graf, former president of the Geneva cantonal government, warned against such “mixed-up” reactions following the killings of staff at the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday that left 12 people dead. French police on Friday were tracking two Muslim extremist suspects in connection with the massacre, apparently motivated by the magazine’s lampooning of Muslim fundamentalism. Wobmann accused the Swiss government of “naivety” in its approach toward Muslim extremists and criticized in particular transport and environment minister Doris Leuthard for a comment she made on Twitter. Leuthard condemned the Paris attack but then she went on to say: “Satire is not a free pass,” in an apparent reference to Charlie Hebdo. The cabinet minister later tried to backtrack with a further tweet, suggesting there was a “misunderstanding” about what she was trying to say. “I’m shocked by the attack,” she said, adding “press freedom is a fundamental right! Nothing justifies the attack.” See also: SWEDISH MUSLIMS FEAR PARIS SHOOTING BACKLASH Wobmann said radical Islam was a danger for a free Switzerland and the spread of Islamism must be combatted, according to the Blick report. He said there was a danger that the most dangerous terrorists could smuggle themselves into the country through requests for asylum. But members of his own party distanced themselves from Wobmann’s call for a specific ban on certain asylum seekers. “We don’t need to fall into this debate without end,” said Claude-Alain Voiblet, an SVP MP from the canton of Vaud said. Voiblet said Switzerland is not an “island of security” and should be prepared for similar attacks as the one in Paris but through a “very precise analysis of the situation”. Wobmann's proposal also comes at a time when other politicians are seeking support to admit 100,000 refugees into Switzerland from war-torn Syria.
Meanwhile, Muslim officials in Switzerland said they were shocked by what happened in Paris and they issued statements condemning the attack. “It’s an abominable crime that stains with blood all of France and puts families in mourning by putting democracy and freedom in danger,” Hafid Ouardiri, former spokesman for the Geneva mosque told The Tribune de Genève. Hasni Abidi, director of the Geneva-based centre for studies and research into the Arabic and Mediterranean world, made similar comments to the newspaper. “It’s an unthinkable act, the determination of the culprits and their wish to kill are awful,” he said. “They want to sow terror, shut up those who are upsetting and divide the French.” Abidi had earlier criticized Charlkie Hebdo for its caricatures of Muhammed published in 2006 but he said the killers should “certainly” punished before stigmatizing and lumping together all Muslims. Nicolas Blancho, head of the Swiss Islamic Council, said in at statement that he was “shocked by this brutal attack”. The council said it understood the discontent spread by the “repeated provocations” of Charlie Hebdo but that this “does not justify the use of violence”. The council said “rigid security measures must not replace social coexistence in mutual tolerance, far from discrimination and targeted provocation”.

The United Nations has taken Switzerland to task for failing to properly investigate the situation of a torture survivor from Eritrea before deporting him to Italy.
The Eritrean applied for asylum in Switzerland in 2015 but the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) sent the man back to Italy under the Dublin Regulation.

According to EU rules enshrined in the Dublin Regulation, applications for asylum should be processed in the first EU country in which asylum seekers arrive.
Despite two appeals, the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland upheld the SEM’s decision to deport the man.
Dutzenden von besonders verletzlichen Asylsuchenden droht die Dublin-Ausweisung - darunter Folteropfer, Opfer von Menschenhandel oder kranke und alte Menschen. Nach dem Entscheid des UNO-Ausschusses gegen #Folter muss das SEM die Fälle neu beurteilen.https://t.co/GVKMjTCzA9 pic.twitter.com/pq814DTJ6f

But in a new ruling, the United Nations Committee Against Torture (CAT) said Swiss immigration authorities had not properly investigated the situation and that had failed to respect human rights.
“The UN has made it clear that the Dublin Regulation must always be applied in accordance with human rights,” asylum expert Muriel Trummer, was quoted as saying in a press release put out by Amnesty International.
“The decision is non-binding but authoritative,” she told Swiss news portal 20 Minuten.
The Eritrean had been undergoing treatment at a Geneva clinic specialising in the treatment of war and torture victims when he was deported.
Trummer, who is familiar with the case, said the man was seriously traumatised after five years of torture in Eritrea. He had already previously been deported to Italy where he found himself living on the street and without access to necessary care.
The man’s case must now be re-examined in Switzerland.
Rights groups are aware of around 60 pending cases involving at-risk asylum seekers including single mothers, torture sufferers and victims of people smuggling, said Trummer. She called on Switzerland to keep in mind CAT recommendations when it came to dealing with this at-risk group.
Switzerland ramps up pressure on Eritreans
Switzerland has taken an increasingly hard line on those Eritreans who have failed in their bid to be granted asylum in Switzerland. In June, the Federal Administrative Court stated deporting failed Eritrean asylum seekers who had not carried out compulsory military service was ""both lawful and reasonable"".
That ruling came after a 2017 judgement stating it was reasonable to return Eritrean citizens who had already previously performed military service to the African country as they were unlikely either to be required to re-join the military or to face other punishment.
Swiss immigration authorities are currently conducting a review of Eritreans granted temporary residence in Switzerland.
Up to 3,200 people could be affected although a recent pilot project involving a review of 250 cases found that only around 20 people could lose their right to reside in Switzerland.

					13:00 CET+01:00				",Meritxell Mir,Swiss village in uproar over asylum centre,"Local officials from Bettwil, in northern Switzerland, have collected almost 10,000 signatures against federal plans to build a refugee centre in the village of 560 inhabitants.
Bettwil has been mobilizing for weeks against federal plans to accommodate up to 100 asylum seekers in a former military barracks in the village, located in the canton of Aargau.
The federal government plans to host between 80 and 100 refugees for a period not exceeding six months.
In the village, cars carry protest stickers and streets are covered with posters that read: “Yes to solidarity, no to the asylum centre”, or “Massive asylum centre, no,” the Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports.
Before Christmas, both the mayor and a committee representing Bettwil citizens travelled to Aargau to bring the signatures and convey their opposition to the government’s plan.
According to Jacqueline Wiederkehr, one of the members of the committee, the Federal Council failed to give the people of Bettwil a chance to voice their opinion prior to the decision.
The mayor of the remote village, Wolfgang Schibler, went further, saying cantonal and federal authorities had acted with “arrogance.”
Schibler has denied accusations of xenophobia, and is seeking to distance himself from extreme right-wing groups supporting his cause.
According to Weiderkehr, the asylum centre will bring crime to a village that boasts a single restaurant and a shop.
“We have zero criminality now, but if, all of the sudden we get 100 young North Africans with nothing to do, criminality will inevitably rise,” she said.
Protesters have decided to lie low until the next meeting with federal and cantonal authorities, set to take place on January 5th.
Between January and November this year, more than 20,000 people have requested asylum in Switzerland, 41.5 percent more than the same period in 2010.
The country is suffering from a shortage of accommodation for asylum seekers. In recent weeks, the Swiss press has reported that several refugees have been forced to sleep on the street due to a lack of beds in official centres."

					21:31 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Iran journo at Lausanne talks seeks Swiss asylum,"In the margins of intense talks in Lausanne to reach a deal over Iran's nuclear future over the weekend an Iranian journalist took advantage of the situation to file a request for asylum in Switzerland, media reports said.
The journalist was working for Iscanews, a news site managed by Azad University in Tehran, which also has other sites across Iran.
Iscanews confirmed the development, the Swiss ATS news agency reported.
The journalist had been sent to Lausanne to cover the negotiations with a photographer, German news agency DPA said.
The state secretariat for migration in Bern declined to comment on the situation.
It does not give information on particular cases because of privacy legislation, a spokeswoman for the secretariat told ATS.
The development occurred on the sidelines of negotiations that aimed to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear future by a Tuesday deadline.
An agreement between Iran and world powers is ""doable"" with ""two or three"" issues left to resolve, Tehran's lead negotiator said on Sunday, AFP reported.
""Getting to an accord is doable,"" Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Lausanne.
""Solutions have been found for numerous questions,"" he said.
""We are still working on two or three issues . . . the talks are in their final phase and are very difficult.""
Araqchi said world powers would meet on Monday to discuss the issues.
US Secretary of State John Kerry and the German and French foreign ministers Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Laurent Fabius were due to sit down with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, as well as their Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif.
They will be joined by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his British counterpart Philip Hammond, who was the last to arrive in Lausanne, late on Sunday."

					09:59 CEST+02:00				", The Local,Swiss village tells landlords: don't rent homes to refugees,"Authorities in a Swiss village have told landlords not to let their properties to asylum seekers for fear they may settle permanently in the area and become a financial burden.
The council in the commune of Rekingen, in the canton of Aargau, is worried that refugees granted a B residency permit will stay in the village and depend on social welfare payable by the commune.
The notice in the official community newsletter Strichpunkt said: “The humanitarian idea behind renting an apartment to them is commendable”.
“These people depend on financial aid,” it added. “Once the municipality is liable, it could mean financial ruin for the community of Rekingen.”
“For this reason we ask property owners to refrain from making rental agreements with asylum seekers who are granted a B permit”
The notice was issued after the council was told that seven asylum seekers had been granted B permits and had decided to stay in Rekingen for the foreseeable future.
In Switzerland asylum seekers are financially supported by the canton they are allocated to on arrival.
Under the rules, once they are recognized as refugees they are given a one-year renewable B permit, allowing temporary residency in Switzerland. From then on, any future welfare benefits, if required, would then be paid by the commune.
Those granted a B permit may choose to live anywhere within the canton but cannot move to another canton without permission.
According to local paper the Aargauer Zeitung, which reported the story on Wednesday, the village of 1,000 residents has hosted 143 asylum seekers in dedicated accommodation since 2009.
Of the seven recently granted the right to stay in Switzerland, five – all Eritreans – have decided to stay in the commune and found a private home there, said the paper.
The council's ‘advice' to landlords in its newsletter has outraged a local refugee association.
Patrizia Bertschi, president of the Aargau Asylum Network Association, said the commune should be helping the refugees to integrate rather than fearing the worst.
“The fact is that these mostly young men were recognized by Switzerland as refugees and will stay here in all likelihood the rest of their lives,” she told the paper.
“So we need to support them to find the right path to financial independence.”
Speaking to the paper, Roman Knöpfel, a municipal councillor responsible for asylum, said it wasn't true that Rekingen didn't want to help the refugees, but that there was a shortage of jobs in the area and it would not be “terribly attractive or lucrative” for them to remain there long term.
Asylum seekers in Switzerland are allocated to cantons according to population size.
The canton of Aargau receives 7.7 percent of all asylum seekers in the country, the fourth most after Zurich (17 percent), Bern (13.5 percent) and Vaud (8.4 percent)."
