1,324 foreigners illegally entered the bela krajina region this year. nine of them drowned while crossing the border river kolpa. the influx of refugees decreased last week. locals feel safe, and campsite owners think that the refugees will not have an impact on tourist visits.
29 foreigners illegally entered into bela krajina last week, while last weekend there were only two illegal entries into the country. after going through the procedures, the police returned them to croatia. this is perhaps one of the reasons for the decrease in the inflow of refugees over the border river kolpa.
boris grabrijan has encountered refugees several times over the past few months. he has not had any negative experience with them.  these people never caused any trouble, and it was obvious that they wished to be seen. in the cold days, occasionally, some of them asked for food or clothes. 
the novo mesto police directorate confirmed that the refugees are not aggressive and did not commit any criminal acts. however, the police still warns people not to invite them into their homes. the tourist season at the kolpa river is not expected to be under threat because of the refugees. the bathing sites were full last weekend. tončka jankovič, the head of the stari pod campsite in the village of adlešiči, said:  there was no fear of being surprised by a migrant. i do not see any reason why this summer at kolpa would be any different. 
boštjan from ljubljana has a weekend/summer house in the bela krajina region. he says that he plans to spend every day by the kolpa river this season, weather permitting.  the only thing i don’t like is the fence,  adds boštjan.
all the bathing sites and camps in bela krajina are fenced with a panel fence, but the police and owners have special measures in place, which will not influence the tourist activities.
