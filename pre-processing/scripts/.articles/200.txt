 i feel a responsibility to be here. i'm against hatred and words often lead to action,  said the participants of the  against political hatred  rally at the republic square in ljubljana. amidst a heated pre-election campaign the rally was prepared by the civil society  no fear coalition . the loud message from the stage was:  let's put a stop to hatred, while we still have time. let us not allow it to rule over us.” in a relaxed atmosphere the square in front of the national assembly was filled with people of all age groups. ivana djilas, a theatre director born in serbia, also talked about words which can quickly spread around the world:  when they say shoot the migrants, that's me, i'm an economic migrant. when they say parasite artists, that's me. when they threaten gays, that's not me, but it could be my son. (...) all of that is me, and tomorrow it can be them. 
vesna leskošek, the dean of the ljubljana faculty of social work, reminded of the duty to speak out for those that are not in a position to speak out for themselves. a member of the trade union, ana jakopič, warned of practices of instigating workers against migrants:  the export of neocolonial politics created refugees, and it now works up other people against them. but the main aim is the worker, who will work for one euro per hour.   we demand a stop to the spreading of fear of differences among the public. politicians forget that a society is made up of everyone,  maja peharc told the gathered. filip dobranić stressed that  when you spread hatred, it spreads across the whole community – many people will identify themselves with one person.  he concluded that as a society we have to open spaces and have such rallies in which people are not violent.  we have to open them up and as a society say 'no' to such politics.
