out of immigrants who first immigrated to slovenia in still live in slovenia on average they are slightly younger less educated and have higher employment rate than the whole population the international migrants day was proclaimed in december was selected in memory of the adoption by the united nations general assembly of the international convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers and members of their families on december in the highest immigration in the history of slovenia was recorded on average annually almost persons immigrated to slovenia in for the first time average age years were so called re immigrants and they were on average years older in november there were persons living in slovenia out of who first immigrated to slovenia in nearly of those immigrants died in slovenia after immigration almost of them emigrated in the first two years after immigration the longer they live in slovenia the less likely it is that they will emigrate more men emigrated four out of ten than women one in four most people who immigrated to slovenia after independence are foreign citizens from former yugoslavia immigrants from also follow the rule over of them were foreigners among first immigrants continuous long lasting living in slovenia and some other personal circumstances such as being married to a citizen of slovenia are preconditions for acquisition of slovenian citizenship foreigners acquired citizenship of them are still living in slovenia so citizenship of the host country is the factor with negative influence on further international mobility unemployment rate for immigrants from is immigrants still living in slovenia were or more years old at the time of first immigration in general a high employment rate is typical for immigrants on january of immigrants from were employed which is percentage points more than the population of slovenia longitudinal data from to consecutive years show that almost half of immigrants were employed all the time and that an additional third of the immigrant stock were employed at least three years only of first immigrants were inactive the whole period an indicator of the worsening of their socio economic situation is the registered unemployment rate which was in january percentage points below the slovenian average but in reached this was above the slovenian average which was only slightly higher than five years before better education is an important factor of the integration of immigrants educational attainment of persons who first immigrated to slovenia in is on average lower than educational attainment of the whole population at the beginning of only of immigrants aged years or more had tertiary education for the whole population the share was however it is important to point out that one in four immigrants aged or more improved the education after immigrating to slovenia this is not true only for the younger population at the time of immigration included in regular educational system but also for persons aged years or more at the time of first immigration to slovenia there is a strong connection between attaining tertiary education and acquiring slovenian citizenship one in five immigrants with foreign citizenship who attained tertiary education in slovenia is now a citizen of slovenia better education is an important factor of the integration of immigrants into a new social environment one in six immigrants from lives in a worker dormitory immigrants are as a rule more mobile than the native population besides they often reside at least at the beginning in collective living quarters such as worker dormitories an important factor with negative influence on mobility is ownership of dwelling and residing in owner occupied dwellings all these facts are valid for first immigrants from only of them are still living at the same address so their mobility rate is for the total population in the same period on january around every sixth immigrants were living in worker dormitories of them the whole period since immigration on january fewer than immigrants were living in owner occupied dwellings of occupied dwellings in slovenia are owner occupied every other household with immigrants from is a one person household according to the register based census there were private households with immigrants from they were living together with immigrants from other years descendants with at least one foreign born parent and native born without immigrant background as there are only of native born without immigrant
