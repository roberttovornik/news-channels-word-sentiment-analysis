on saturday leaders of eu’s 27 member countries discussed political directions for negotiations with the united kingdom regarding brexit, and emphasized that the priority was the protection of eu citizens.
before the summit, representatives of the slovenian and croatian governments met with the european commission and achieved some progress in eliminating traffic congestions on the border between slovenia and croatia caused by eu’s new schengen rules. if the traffic delay exceeds 15 minutes, border patrol officers can resort to a less strict form of border checks.
tourists had to wait from 20 to 50 minutes to cross the border at dragonja on saturday. on the croatian side, a protest of about 50 locals from the croatian part of istria took place. the protesters expressed opposition to stricter border checks, as this brings trouble to daily migrants as well as tourist workers, and announced new protests if both countries and brussels refuse to listen.
